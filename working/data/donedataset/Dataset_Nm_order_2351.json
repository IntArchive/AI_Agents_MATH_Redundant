    "Content": "I'm trying to find the Galois group of the polynomial $p(X)= X^5+X+1$ over $\\mathbb Q$. First, one notes that, if $\\omega$ is a primitive cubic root of unity, then it is a root of $p(X)$. So, $X^2+X+1$ is a factor of $p(X)$. We have the following factorisation:\n\\begin{equation}\np(X) = (X^2+X+1)(X^3-X^2+1).\n\\end{equation}\nNow, the derivative of $p(X)$ is $p'(X) = X^4+1$, which is always positive. Hence, $p(X)$ has only one real root, which is a root $\\alpha$ of $X^3-X^2+1$. Let me denote by $\\eta$ and $\\overline{\\eta}$ the other two complex roots of $X^3-X^2+1$. Then, a splitting field of $p(X)$ over $\\mathbb Q$ is clearly given by\n\\begin{equation}\nK = \\mathbb Q(\\alpha, \\omega, \\eta).\n\\end{equation}\nNext, I have to compute the degree $[K : \\mathbb Q]$ of the extension. It is simple to prove that $[\\mathbb Q(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb Q] = 6$: in fact, $\\mathbb Q(\\alpha, \\eta)$ is a splitting field of $X^3-X^2+1$ over $\\mathbb Q$, and this polynomial has only one real root. So, I try to compute as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n[K : \\mathbb Q] = [K : \\mathbb Q(\\alpha,\\eta)][\\mathbb Q(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb Q].\n\\end{equation}\nHere comes my problem: clearly, the degree $[K : \\mathbb Q(\\alpha,\\eta)]$ is $1$ or $2$. The point is to understand whether $\\omega \\in \\mathbb Q(\\alpha, \\eta)$ or not, and I'm unable to give an answer. I think that actually $[K : \\mathbb Q(\\alpha,\\eta)] = 2$, and that eventually one can prove that the Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(K | \\mathbb Q)$ is isomorphic to $S_3 \\times C_2$. How can I prove this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The only quadratic subextension of $\\Bbb Q \\subset \\Bbb Q(\\alpha,\\eta)$ is given by the subfield fixed by the index $2$ subgroup $A_3$ of $S_3$.\nIt is generated by $(\\alpha-\\eta)(\\eta-\\bar{\\eta})(\\bar{\\eta}-\\alpha)$, which is the square root of the discriminant $\\Delta$ of $X^3-X^2+1$ A computation gives $\\Delta = 23$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to find the Galois group of the polynomial \\( p(X) = X^5 + X + 1 \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). They've already factored it into \\( (X^2 + X + 1)(X^3 - X^2 + 1) \\). The quadratic factor is cyclotomic (related to cube roots of unity), and the cubic factor is irreducible, right? Let me check that.\n\nFirst, confirm the factorization. Plugging \\( \\omega \\) (a primitive cubic root of unity) into \\( p(X) \\), we get \\( \\omega^5 + \\omega + 1 \\). Since \\( \\omega^3 = 1 \\), \\( \\omega^5 = \\omega^{3+2} = \\omega^2 \\). So, \\( \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0 \\), which means \\( \\omega \\) is indeed a root. So, \\( X^2 + X + 1 \\) is a factor. Then, polynomial division or equating coefficients would give the cubic factor \\( X^3 - X^2 + 1 \\). That seems correct.\n\nNext, check if the cubic \\( X^3 - X^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). Using the Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are \\( \\pm1 \\). Testing \\( X=1 \\): \\( 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\). \\( X=-1 \\): \\( -1 -1 +1 = -1 \\neq 0 \\). So, no rational roots, hence irreducible as a cubic. Therefore, the splitting field of \\( p(X) \\) must include the roots of both the quadratic and the cubic.\n\nThe derivative \\( p'(X) = 5X^4 + 1 \\), which is always positive since \\( X^4 \\geq 0 \\), so \\( p'(X) > 0 \\). Therefore, \\( p(X) \\) is strictly increasing, so only one real root. That real root must come from the cubic factor \\( X^3 - X^2 + 1 \\), since the quadratic has complex roots. So, the cubic has one real root \\( \\alpha \\) and two complex roots \\( \\eta, \\overline{\\eta} \\).\n\nThe splitting field \\( K \\) of \\( p(X) \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta, \\omega) \\). The user says \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 6 \\). Let me verify that. Since the cubic is irreducible, \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 3 \\). Then, \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\) is the splitting field of the cubic over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). The degree of the splitting field for a cubic with one real and two complex roots should be 6, since the discriminant? Let me recall that for a cubic with discriminant not a square, the Galois group is S3, which has order 6. Let me compute the discriminant of \\( X^3 - X^2 + 1 \\).\n\nThe discriminant of a cubic \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) is \\( \\Delta = 18abc - 4a^3c + a^2b^2 - 4b^3 - 27c^2 \\). For our cubic \\( X^3 - X^2 + 1 \\), \\( a = -1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 1 \\). Plugging in: \\( \\Delta = 18*(-1)*0*1 -4*(-1)^3*1 + (-1)^2*0^2 -4*0^3 -27*1^2 = 0 -4*(-1)*1 + 0 -0 -27 = 4 -27 = -23 \\). So, discriminant is -23, which is not a square. Hence, the Galois group is S3, so the splitting field has degree 6. Therefore, \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 6 \\).\n\nNow, the user is considering \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}] = [K : \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta)] \\times [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb{Q}] \\). Since \\( [\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 6 \\), then \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}] = 6 \\times [K : \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta)] \\).\n\nWhat's \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta)] \\)? Since \\( K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta, \\omega) \\), and \\( \\omega \\) is a root of \\( X^2 + X + 1 \\). If \\( \\omega \\) is already in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\), then the degree is 1; otherwise, it's 2. The user is unsure whether \\( \\omega \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\).\n\nTo determine this, we need to check if \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\) contains the roots of \\( X^2 + X + 1 \\), which are \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega^2 \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\) is the splitting field of the cubic, which has Galois group S3, which doesn't contain any quadratic subfields unless the discriminant is a square. But the discriminant here is -23, so the quadratic subfield would be \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23}) \\). However, \\( \\omega \\) generates \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) \\). So, unless \\( \\sqrt{-3} \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23}) \\), which would require that -3 is a square in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23}) \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23}) \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) \\) are different quadratic fields. Therefore, \\( \\omega \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\), so \\( [K : \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta)] = 2 \\). Hence, the total degree is 6*2=12.\n\nThen, the Galois group Gal(K/Q) would be the group of order 12. The user suggests it's S3 x C2. Let's see: the splitting field K is the compositum of the splitting fields of the quadratic and the cubic. The quadratic has Galois group C2 (cyclic of order 2), and the cubic has Galois group S3. If these extensions are disjoint (i.e., their intersection is Q), then the Galois group of the compositum is the product S3 x C2. To check if they are disjoint, need to see if \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega) \\) intersect only in Q. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega) \\) is degree 2, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\eta) \\) is degree 6, their intersection must be a divisor of gcd(2,6)=2. But if the intersection were Q(sqrt(-3)) and Q(alpha,eta) contains Q(sqrt(-23)), which are different, so the intersection is Q. Therefore, the Galois group is indeed S3 x C2.\n\nHence, the answer is the Galois group is isomorphic to S3 × C2. To prove that ω is not in Q(α, η), we note that Q(α,η) has discriminant -23, which is different from the discriminant of Q(ω) which is -3. Since quadratic fields with different discriminants are distinct, their intersection is Q, hence ω is not in Q(α,η), so the degree is 2, making the total Galois group the product.",
