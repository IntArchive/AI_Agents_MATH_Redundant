    "Content": "Question: How can we prove $$I=\\int_0^{\\pi/4}{(4\\cot x\\ln\\sec x-x)\\ln^2\\tan xdx}=\\frac5{2304}\\pi^4?$$ I confirmed, numerically, that it holds for 1000 decimal places. This integral came up when I was calculating $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{H_{4n}}{n^3}$ . Attempt Note that $\\tan x=i\\frac{1-e^{2ix}}{1+e^{2ix}}$ , substituing $t=e^{ix}$ gives $$I=\\int_1^{e^{i\\pi/4}}\\frac it\\left(\\frac{1+t^2}{1-t^2}\\ln\\frac{2t}{1+t^2}-\\frac1i\\ln t\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\pi i}2+\\ln\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\\right)^2dt,$$ then I tried $t^2\\mapsto t$ , $$I=\\frac12\\int_1^{i}\\frac it\\left(\\frac{1+t}{1-t}(\\ln2+(\\ln t)/2-\\ln(1+t))-\\frac1{2i}\\ln t\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\pi i}2+\\ln\\frac{1-t}{1+t}\\right)^2dt,$$ For the next step I substituted $u=\\frac{1-t}{1+t}$ , but it makes the integral more complex. Moreover, the substitution seem to turn the integral into the original form. I got stuck here.",

We will use the symmetric nature of $f$ to evaluate the $J$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange and filter out the unrelated information. The user wants me to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: the user is asking to evaluate the integral I, which is defined as the integral from 0 to π/4 of (4 cot x ln sec x - x) times ln² tan x dx, and they want to show that this equals 5π⁴/2304. They mention they confirmed it numerically and that it came up in calculating a sum involving harmonic numbers. Then they describe some attempts with substitutions involving complex variables and substitutions that made the integral more complex.\n\nNow, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given for the previous problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in this case, the integral's limits and the functions involved need to be considered.\n\nAssumptions here would relate to the variables and functions in the integral. Let's see:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to π/4.\n2. The integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by ln² tan x.\n3. The variable of integration is x.\n4. The functions involved (cot x, ln sec x, ln tan x) are defined and integrable over the interval [0, π/4]. However, do we need to state that? The example didn't include such assumptions, perhaps because they were considered given. But maybe the key conditions here are the limits and the form of the integrand.\n\nWait, the example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this integral problem, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the integral's setup. The problem is to evaluate the integral as stated. The user didn't mention any parameters or conditions beyond the integral itself. So maybe the assumptions here are just the components of the integral: the integral is over x from 0 to π/4, the integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) * ln² tan x dx. But how to break this into single line assumptions?\n\nLooking at the example, each assumption is a separate condition. In this case, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/4].\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x) squared.\nx is the variable of integration.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about variables in the problem (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, the integral's structure is part of the problem statement. However, maybe there are implicit conditions, like the functions being integrable, but perhaps the user wants only explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Evaluate I = ∫₀^{π/4} [4 cot x ln sec x - x] ln² tan x dx = 5π⁴/2304\". So the problem is to prove that this integral equals that value. The assumptions would be the components of the integral. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption? Wait, no. Wait, the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions include n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Or maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the example is illustrative but not exact. The user's instruction is to structure the problem with assumptions listed, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the integral problem, the main components are the integral's limits, the integrand's form, and the variable. But perhaps the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\nThe upper limit of integration is π/4.\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x)^2.\nThe variable of integration is x.\n\nBut maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to list each mathematical object and their properties. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\nThe integrand function is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) (ln tan x)^2.\nx is a real variable in the interval (0, π/4).\n\nBut since the problem is to evaluate the integral, the main assumptions are about the integral setup. The example's assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. In this case, maybe the only assumption is that the integral is in the given form over the specified interval. However, perhaps the user expects to list each component separately as per the example's structure. Wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition. For this integral problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of the integral is 0.\nThe upper limit of the integral is π/4.\nThe integrand is composed of (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x)^2.\nThe integration variable is x.\n\nBut maybe the integration variable is considered part of the integral setup, so not a separate assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to list the conditions necessary for the integral to be defined, like the functions being integrable over the interval. But the example didn't include such, so maybe we just stick to the problem's explicit parts.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/4].\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x)(ln tan x)^2.\nProblem:\nEvaluate $$I = \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\left(4 \\cot x \\ln \\sec x - x\\right) \\ln^2 \\tan x \\, dx$$ and show that it equals $\\frac{5}{2304}\\pi^4$.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line should just restate the problem. The original problem's title is \"Evaluate...\". So perhaps the problem line is \"Evaluate I = ... and prove that it equals 5π⁴/2304\".\n\nBut the user's example had the problem line as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo in this case, the problem would be \"Evaluate I = ... and show that it equals 5π⁴/2304.\"\n\nBut the original problem statement is \"How can we prove I = ... = 5π⁴/2304?\" So the problem is to prove the equality. Therefore, the problem line should be \"Prove that I = ... equals 5π⁴/2304.\"\n\nThus, combining this:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to π/4.\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x)(ln tan x)^2.\nThe integration variable is x.\nProblem:\nProve that $$I = \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\left(4 \\cot x \\ln \\sec x - x\\right) \\ln^2 \\tan x \\, dx = \\frac{5}{2304}\\pi^4.$$\n\nBut the example had each assumption as a separate line. Each assumption line addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. For the integral problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\nThe upper limit of integration is π/4.\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x)^2.\nThe integration variable is x.\n\nBut maybe \"The integrand is composed of the function (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x)^2.\" But perhaps each part of the integrand is considered? No, the example didn't break down the expression for A(n); it just stated the expression as part of the problem. So perhaps the assumptions are about the variables and limits, and the problem includes the integral expression.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were about n: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) (defined as ...) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the integral problem, there's no variable parameter like n; it's a definite integral. So the assumptions would relate to the integral's setup. But since there are no parameters with conditions, maybe the only assumption is the integral's structure. However, the user's example had two assumptions even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which might not have required the divisibility by 7. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting unless the user made a mistake or the example is hypothetical.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is showing how to structure, even if the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. That can't be. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. But regardless, the instruction is to list all assumptions from the problem. So perhaps in the integral problem, the assumptions are just the integral's components.\n\nBut since the problem is to evaluate the integral as given, there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's definition. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, π/4].\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x)(ln tan x)^2.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, it was added as an assumption. That seems incorrect, unless the example is illustrative of a different problem. Maybe the example was for a different problem where the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's hidden assumption. But in the case of the integral, there are no hidden assumptions, just the integral as stated. Therefore, maybe the formatted problem for the integral should have the assumptions being the integral's limits and integrand.\n\nThus, following the example's structure, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to π/4.\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x)(ln tan x)^2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$I = \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\left(4 \\cot x \\ln \\sec x - x\\right) \\ln^2 \\tan x \\, dx = \\frac{5}{2304}\\pi^4.$$\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is a single property. For example, in the example, two separate assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So here, each line should be one assumption. So the integral's lower limit is 0, upper limit is π/4, integrand is the given function. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0.\nThe upper limit of integration is π/4.\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x)(ln tan x)^2.\nThe variable of integration is x.\n\nBut maybe that's over-specifying. Alternatively, since the integral is given as ∫₀^{π/4} ... dx, the limits and variable are part of the problem statement. The example included the structure of A(n) in the problem line, not in the assumptions. So perhaps here, the assumptions are just the parts necessary for the problem. Since the example listed n's properties, here, perhaps there are no separate assumptions beyond what's in the integral. But the user's format requires assumptions, so maybe in this case, since the problem is straightforward, the assumptions are minimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition, but the user's format requires listing them. So, following the example where the problem's expression was part of the problem line, not the assumptions, the assumptions would be about the components of the integral.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the example included assumptions that were not all present in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumptions added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be necessary for the divisibility by 91 (since 91=7*13). So perhaps in that case, the user included both the given condition (n is integer) and an implicit condition (n divisible by 7) to make the proof work. But in the integral problem, there are no such hidden conditions; the problem is to evaluate the integral as stated.\n\nTherefore, maybe for this integral problem, the assumptions are just the integral's setup. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/4].\nThe integrand is (4 cot x ln sec x - x) multiplied by (ln tan x)^2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$I = \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\left(4 \\cot x \\ln \\sec x - x\\right) \\ln^2 \\tan x \\, dx = \\frac{5}{2304}\\pi^4.$$\n\nBut perhaps \"The functions cot x, sec x, tan x are defined on [0, π/4]\" is an assumption, but that's implicit. Since in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n, here the integral's variable x is real and in [0, π/4]. But maybe that's considered part of the integral's setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0, π/4].\ncot x, sec x, and tan x are defined and integrable over [0, π/4].\nThe integral is evaluated with respect to x.\n\nBut again, the example didn't include such detailed function properties. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. So perhaps for this problem, the key assumptions are the integral's limits and the form of the integrand, which are explicitly given.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering the example and the structure required, the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. For the integral problem, this would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/4.\nThe integrand is the product of (4 cot x ln sec x - x) and (ln tan x)^2.\nProblem:\nProve that $$I = \\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\left(4 \\cot x \\ln \\sec x - x\\right) \\ln^2 \\tan x \\, dx = \\frac{5}{2304}\\pi^4.$$",
