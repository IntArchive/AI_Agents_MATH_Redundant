    "Content": "Prove that: $$e^\\pi+\\frac{1}{\\pi}< \\pi^{e}+1$$ Using Wolfram Alpha $\\pi e^{\\pi}+1 \\approx 73.698\\ldots$ and $\\pi(\\pi^{e}+1) \\approx 73.699\\ldots$ Can this inequality be proven without brute-force estimations (anything of the sort $e\\approx 2.7182...$ or $\\pi \\approx 3.1415...$ )? I've just seen this and I remembered I've seen the question asked here in an older paper, but I don't remember the details. Note that this is sharper because it can be written as: $$e^{\\pi}-\\pi^e<1-\\frac{1}{\\pi}<1$$ I've tried, but none of the methods in the linked question (which study the function $x^\\frac{1}{x}$ ) can be applied here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "From the continued fraction expansion of $\\pi$ , we have $$\n\\frac{333}{106}\\lt\\frac{103993}{33102}\\lt\\pi\\lt\\frac{355}{113}\\;.\n$$ There are various ways of proving these inequalities without using decimal approximations: The accepted answer to How to find continued fraction of pi shows how to find the continued fraction expansion without using decimal approximations as inputs. This answer to Is there an integral that proves $\\pi > 333/106$? provides integrals with positive integrands that evaluate to the differences in these inequalities. You can sum a couple of terms e.g. of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula for $\\pi$ , bound the remainder with a geometric series and compare the resulting fractions to the bounds above. In the case of $\\mathrm e$ , the continued fraction expansion is regular and can be systematically derived (see e.g. A Short Proof of the Simple Continued Fraction Expansion of e by Henry Cohn, The American Mathematical Monthly , $113(1)$ , $57$ – $62$ , The Simple Continued Fraction Expansion of e by C. D. Olds, The American Mathematical Monthly , $77(9)$ , $968$ – $974$ , or Continued fraction for e at Topological Musings ); it yields $$\n\\frac{1264}{465}\\lt\\mathrm e\\lt\\frac{1457}{536}\\;.\n$$ Thus it suffices to show that $$\n\\left(\\frac{1457}{536}\\right)^\\frac{355}{113}+\\frac1{\\frac{333}{106}}\\lt\\left(\\frac{103993}{33102}\\right)^\\frac{1264}{465} + 1\\;,\n$$ or $$\n\\left(\\frac{1457}{536}\\right)^\\frac{355}{113}\\lt\\left(\\frac{103993}{33102}\\right)^\\frac{1264}{465} + \\frac{227}{333}\\;.\n$$ Since both sides contain fractional exponents, it’s hard to compare them directly; but we can find a fraction that lies between them and compare them to it separately. Among the suitable fractions, the one with the lowest denominator is $\\frac{4767}{206}$ . The rational inequalities $$\n\\left(\\frac{1457}{536}\\right)^{355}\\lt\\left(\\frac{4767}{206}\\right)^{113}\n$$ and $$\n\\left(\\frac{4767}{206}-\\frac{227}{333}\\right)^{465}\\lt\\left(\\frac{103993}{33102}\\right)^{1264}\n$$ are readily checked with integer arithmetic, and thus with $$\n\\left(\\frac{1457}{536}\\right)^\\frac{355}{113}\\lt\\frac{4767}{206}\\lt\\left(\\frac{103993}{33102}\\right)^\\frac{1264}{465} + \\frac{227}{333}\n$$ the result follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is to prove the inequality \\( e^\\pi + \\frac{1}{\\pi} < \\pi^e + 1 \\). \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem statement doesn't explicitly state many conditions, but I should check for any implicit assumptions. The question mentions not using brute-force estimations like approximating \\( e \\) or \\( \\pi \\). However, in the formatted example provided earlier, assumptions were things like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the main variables are \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\), which are mathematical constants. The problem is about proving an inequality between two expressions involving these constants.\n\nWait, are there any specific conditions or constraints given in the problem? The user mentions that it's sharper because it can be rewritten as \\( e^\\pi - \\pi^e < 1 - \\frac{1}{\\pi} < 1 \\). But the original inequality itself doesn't have any stated restrictions on variables since \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are constants. So, perhaps there are no additional assumptions here beyond the standard definitions of \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\).\n\nBut looking back at the example, the assumption was about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, since there are no variables but constants, maybe there are no assumptions to list. However, the problem does mention not using brute-force estimations. But in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's conditions, not the methods. So perhaps in this case, there are no assumptions to list except the standard definitions of \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\). But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so that became the assumption. The user then added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" but that might have been part of their example. Wait, looking back, the original example was the user's formatted version where they listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\", but the problem statement in the formatted version included \"n is divisible by 7\" as part of the assumptions. Wait, no, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nThe original example problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. However, in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't have that. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe in their example, they modified the problem. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe in their example, they included an extra assumption for illustration purposes. But in any case, the task is to read the given Math Stack Exchange question and structure it according to the format.\n\nSo the current problem is to prove \\( e^\\pi + \\frac{1}{\\pi} < \\pi^e + 1 \\). The user mentions that Wolfram Alpha gives approximate values, and asks if this can be proven without brute-force estimations. The problem is rewritten as \\( e^\\pi - \\pi^e < 1 - \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\), which is less than 1. \n\nNow, the assumptions here. The problem is to prove the inequality between these constants. Since \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are fixed constants, there's no variable here. So perhaps there are no assumptions other than the standard definitions of \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\). But the format requires listing assumptions. Wait, the example had assumptions even when the problem was about integers. So in this case, maybe the assumption is that \\( e \\) is the base of natural logarithm and \\( \\pi \\) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. But that seems too obvious. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions, but the problem is just to prove the inequality as stated. \n\nLooking at the user's example, they took the original problem which had \"for every integer n\" and included that as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, since there are no variables or conditions, there are no assumptions to list. However, the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the user wants me to list the fact that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the standard mathematical constants. But the example didn't list properties of numbers unless they were part of the problem's conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has an implicit assumption that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are real numbers. But that's inherent. Since the example included \"n is an integer\" when the problem was about integers, perhaps here we can say \"e is the base of the natural logarithm\" and \"π is the circle constant\" but I'm not sure if that's necessary. However, the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this problem, even though there's no variable, we need to list the constants involved. But the problem doesn't state any conditions on e and π, they are just standard constants. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions here, and the problem is just to prove the inequality. But the format requires the \"Assumption\" section. If I leave it empty, it might be invalid. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so that was an assumption. The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the problem's original statement. But in the current problem, the original question is to prove the inequality. There's no variable here, so perhaps the assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the standard mathematical constants. But since they are universally known, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions. However, the format might need at least one assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, but according to the example, even if there are none, we need to state them. But the example had assumptions. If the original problem doesn't have any variables or conditions, maybe the Assumption section is empty. But the user's example shows that even the original problem's conditions are listed as assumptions. Since in this problem, the inequality is between constants, perhaps there are no assumptions. But the user's format requires the Assumption section. Maybe we can write \"None\" or similar. However, looking back at the example, the user included the problem's original condition as an assumption. In this case, the problem doesn't have variables, so perhaps the Assumption section is empty. But since the user's example included assumptions even when the problem was about variables, I need to see if there's any hidden assumption here.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the inequality without brute-force estimations. Does that count as an assumption? Like, the method should not use approximations. But in the problem statement, the user is asking if it can be proven without such estimations, but that's a constraint on the method, not an assumption of the problem. So maybe the Assumption section is empty. However, in the example, the problem had assumptions on the variables, not on the method. So perhaps here, since there are no variables, the Assumption section is empty. But the format requires the Assumption section. Maybe I can write \"No assumptions stated\" or similar, but the user's example didn't do that. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that e and π are real numbers. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". The user's formatted problem added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", but that might have been a mistake or a modification. Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That changes the problem. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to modify the problem. But according to the instructions, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in the example, the original problem had an unrelated condition, and the user filtered it to list the assumptions. But in this case, the original problem is about proving the inequality, and there are no stated assumptions. So perhaps the Assumption section is empty, but the format requires it. However, since the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them, maybe I need to infer. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has an implicit assumption that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the standard constants. But that's inherent. Since the user's example included explicit assumptions even when they were part of the original problem's quantifiers, perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, there are no assumptions. Therefore, the Assumption section would be empty. However, in the example, the user listed the problem's quantifier as an assumption. So maybe in this case, since there are no variables, there are no assumptions. But the user's format requires an Assumption section. I'm a bit confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has an assumption that the inequality is to be proven without brute-force estimations. But that's a constraint on the method, not an assumption of the problem. The problem itself is to prove the inequality, regardless of method. The user is asking if it can be done without estimations, but the formatted problem should list the problem's conditions, not the solution method's constraints. Therefore, the Assumption section should list any conditions or properties that the problem assumes. Since the problem is about constants, there are no variables, hence no assumptions. Therefore, the Assumption section might be empty. But the user's example didn't have an empty assumption section. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the mathematical constants they represent. But that's too trivial. Maybe the problem has no assumptions. In that case, perhaps the Assumption section is left with a dash or \"None\". But the example shows that even if the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the variables, they are listed. So in this case, since there are no variables, maybe we list nothing. But the user's example required listing assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. \n\nGiven that, perhaps in this case, the Assumption section is empty. But how to represent that? The user's example included assumptions even if the problem had variables. Since the current problem has no variables, maybe the Assumption section is empty. However, the problem mentions that the inequality is sharper because it can be written as \\( e^\\pi - \\pi^e < 1 - \\frac{1}{\\pi} <1 \\). But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. \n\nI think in this case, there are no explicit assumptions to list. Therefore, the Assumption section would be empty. However, the format requires the Assumption section. Maybe the user expects that if there are no assumptions, we leave it blank. But the example didn't do that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are positive real numbers. But that's obvious. \n\nGiven the user's example, where they took the original problem's condition (for every integer n) and listed it as an assumption, but added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, perhaps there was a mistake. But maybe the user intended to show that assumptions can be added. However, in our case, the original problem doesn't have variables, so no assumptions. Therefore, perhaps we should list no assumptions. \n\nBut the user's format requires the Assumption section. So I need to write something. Maybe the only assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the standard mathematical constants. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that we are working in the real numbers, but that's standard. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may have no assumptions, and the user's example was incorrect. But regardless, according to the instructions, I need to structure the problem as per the format. \n\nGiven that, and looking at the example, the Assumption section lists conditions on the variables. Since this problem has no variables, perhaps there are no assumptions. Therefore, I can write \"None\" or leave it empty. But in the example, even if the problem was about integers, it was listed. So maybe in this problem, since there are no variables, the Assumption section is empty. \n\nBut according to the user's example, even if there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem's statement, they are listed. For instance, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, which became an assumption. In this problem, since there are no variables, there's no such assumption. Therefore, the Assumption section is empty. \n\nBut how to represent that in the format? The user's example included two assumptions. Maybe in this case, we can list the constants as assumptions, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that the inequality is to be proven using analytical methods, but that's a solution constraint, not a problem assumption. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the problem's conditions are listed as assumptions, and since this problem has no variables or conditions, perhaps the Assumption section is empty. However, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user intended to extract implicit assumptions. But in this case, there are none. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are transcendental numbers, but that's not relevant here. \n\nAfter considering all possibilities, I think the correct approach is to list no assumptions since the problem involves only constants with no additional conditions. Therefore, the Assumption section is empty. However, the example provided by the user included assumptions, so there might be confusion. But given that, I'll proceed by stating that there are no explicit assumptions beyond the standard definitions of \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\), but according to the format, perhaps it's better to leave the Assumption section blank. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove an inequality, maybe the assumption is that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are positive real numbers, which they are. But that's inherent. \n\nBut following the example structure, which listed specific conditions on the variables, and since here there are no variables, I'll proceed with no assumptions. Therefore, the Assumption section is empty. But the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe in this case, since there are none, we can put \"None\" under Assumption. However, in the example, the user didn't do that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has an assumption that \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\) are the standard constants, so we list them. But that's unconventional. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but aiming to comply with the format, I'll list the constants as assumptions, even though it's redundant. \n\nAssumption: \n\\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm,\n\\( \\pi \\) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( e^\\pi + \\frac{1}{\\pi} < \\pi^e + 1 \\).\n\nBut this seems forced. However, according to the example, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. Since the problem involves \\( e \\) and \\( \\pi \\), defining them as such could be considered assumptions. But in mathematical problems, these are standard and usually not listed as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the operations (exponentiation, addition) are defined as usual. But again, that's standard. \n\nGiven the user's example, where assumptions were about the variables in the problem, and here there are no variables, perhaps the Assumption section is empty. However, to adhere to the format, I need to include the Assumption section. Maybe in this case, the problem has no explicit assumptions, so we can write \"None\" or leave it blank. But the example didn't do that. \n\nConsidering the user's example, which included assumptions even when the problem's original statement had variables, but here there are none, I'll proceed by stating that there are no assumptions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: None\n\nProblem: Prove that \\( e^\\pi + \\frac{1}{\\pi} < \\pi^e + 1 \\).\n\nBut the example didn't have \"None\"; it had specific assumptions. Maybe the user expects that even if there are no assumptions, we list the problem's context. However, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with listing the constants as assumptions to fulfill the format.",
