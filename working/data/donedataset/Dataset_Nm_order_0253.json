First, loagrithmically differentiate the Weierstrass-form product of the hyperbolic cosine, \nto obtain $\\displaystyle \\, \\frac{1}{8x}\\tanh(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac1{\\pi^2 (2n+1)^2+(2x)^2}\\,.$ Also, since (elementarily) we have $\\displaystyle \\,\\,\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac1{a^2+x^2}\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi}{2a},\\,\\,$ it follows that \n$\\displaystyle \\,\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac1{(a^2+x^2)(b^2+x^2)}\\,dx=\\frac1{b^2-a^2}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac1{a^2+x^2}-\\frac1{b^2+x^2}\\right)dx=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\frac1{ab(a+b)}.$ So, \n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\tanh(x)\\,\\tanh(x s)}{64 x^2 s}\\,dx\\\\\n&=\\int_0^{\\infty} \\sum_{n,m=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac1{(\\pi^2(2n+1)^2+(2x)^2)(\\pi^2(2m+1)^2+(2xs)^2)}\\,\\,dx\\\\\n&=\\frac1{2^2 (2s)^2} \\sum_{n,m=0}^{\\infty} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\dfrac1{x^2+\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(2n+1)\\right)^2}\\,\\dfrac1{x^2+\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2s}(2m+1)\\right)^2}\\,dx\\\\\n&=\\frac1{4\\pi^2} \\sum_{n,m=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac1{(2n+1)\\,(2m+1)\\,\\,((2n+1)+s(2m+1))}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{4\\pi^2} \\sum_{n,m=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac1{(2n+1)(2m+1)} \\int_0^1 x^{(2n+1)+s(2m+1)}\\,\\frac{dx}{x}\\\\\n&=\\frac1{16\\pi^2} \\int_0^1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x}{1+x}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^s}{1+x^s}\\right)\\,\\frac{dx}{x}.\n\\end{align*}$$ Example no. 1 Set $s=1$.

It seems that a closed form may exist for each natural $s$ (and therfore, for each $1/n$ where $n$ is natural). For example, under the subsitution $x \\mapsto \\frac{1-x}{1+x}$, the expression $\\displaystyle \\frac{1-x^5}{1+x^5}$ turns into $\\displaystyle \\frac{x(x^4+10x^2+5)}{5x^4+10x^2+1}$. Factorizing $x^4+10x^2+5=(x^2+5+2\\sqrt{5})(x^2+5-2\\sqrt{5})$ and $\\displaystyle 5x^4+10x^2+1=5\\left(x^2+\\frac1{5+2\\sqrt{5}}\\right)\\left(x^2+\\frac1{5-2\\sqrt{5}}\\right)$, it follows that \n$$ \\int_0^1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x}{1+x}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^5}{1+x^5}\\right)\\frac{dx}{x}=\\frac72\\zeta(3)+\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\ln5+2f\\left(\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{5}}\\right)+2f\\left(\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}\\right)-2f\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{5}}}\\right)-2f\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}}\\right).$$ Similarly,\n$$\\int_0^1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x}{1+x}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^6}{1+x^6}\\right)\\frac{dx}{x}=\\frac72\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\ln6+2f(\\sqrt{3})+2f\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)-2f(1)-2f(2+\\sqrt{3})-2f(2-\\sqrt{3}).$$ A pattern can be seen.\nIt seems that we can always factorize the expression that results by applying $x\\mapsto \\frac{1-x}{1+x}$ to $\\frac{1-x^n}{1+x^n}$ into factors of the form $x$ and $x^2+r^2$ ($r \\in \\mathbb{C}$), implying that there is indeed a closed form in terms of logarithms and polylogarithms\nfor $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\tanh(x)\\tanh(xn)/x^2\\,\\,dx$.\nIn fact, the roots $r$ in the factorization seem to always be $\\tan(q \\pi)$ (up to multiplication by an imaginary unit), where q is a rational number (whose denominator is $n$ when $n$ is odd and $2n$ when it is even) . For example, $\\displaystyle \\sqrt{2}-1=\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}=\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{5}\\right),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,2-\\sqrt{3}=\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)\\,\\,$etc. I am too lazy to write a general formula that works for every natural number. $\\Large \\mathbf {EDIT}$ For the sake of completeness, I add below the general formula, which works for every natural number. Theorem 2. $\\,$\n  Let $n$ be a positive integer. Define the function $F$ by\n  $$ F(z)=\\text{Li}_3(z) + 2\\text{Li}_3(1-z) - \\ln(1-z)\\text{Li}_2(1-z) -\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\ln(1-z)-2\\zeta(3),$$\n  where we assume the principal value of the logarithm.\n  Now, define the function $g$ by\n  $$g(z)=F(-z^2)-8 \\operatorname{Re} F(i z).$$ \n  Then\n  $$ \n\\int_0^1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x}{1+x}\\right)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x^n}{1+x^n}\\right)\\frac{dx}{x} \n=\\frac{7}{2}\\zeta(3)+\\frac12 \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^k g\\left(\\cot\\left(\\frac{k \\pi}{2 n}\\right)\\right) .$$ This result, with the help of theorem $(1)$, can easily be seen to establish a closed form \nfor $\\mathcal A(n) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\tanh(x) \\tanh(n x)}{x^2}dx $ for each natural $n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem formatting task. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, line by line, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about an integral that supposedly equals 14ζ(3)/π². The user mentions changing variables and provides equivalent forms, and then asks about generalizations. However, the main problem is proving the initial integral. The assumptions here might not be explicit, so I need to infer any implicit conditions.\n\nLooking at the integral ∫₀^∞ [tanh²(x)/x²] dx, the assumptions would relate to the conditions under which this integral is defined. For example, tanh²(x) is involved, which is defined for all real x, and the integral is from 0 to infinity. The integrand's behavior at 0 and infinity might be important. Also, the substitution x = -½ ln z is used, so z ranges from 0 to 1. The integrand after substitution has denominators involving z and ln²z, so we need to ensure convergence at z approaching 1 and 0.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state any specific conditions; it just presents the integral and asks for proof. The original problem's assumptions might be that the integral converges, and the substitution is valid. However, since the example given in the user's prompt included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but here, the integral's validity is more about the function's behavior. But maybe there are no explicit assumptions given, so the only assumption is that the integral exists (converges). Alternatively, the substitution step might require certain conditions, like z being in (0,1) and the transformation being valid.\n\nWait, the problem states that after changing variable x = -½ ln z, it takes the equivalent form. So maybe the substitution is part of the problem-solving process, not an assumption. The user is asking how to prove the result, so the problem is to show that the integral equals 14ζ(3)/π². The assumptions would be that the integral converges, but perhaps the user hasn't stated any. Since the example included assumptions even if the original problem didn't (like in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should just be n is an integer. But the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That might be an error. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, and the correct assumptions should only be that n is an integer. But according to the example given, the user included an extra assumption. Hmm, maybe the example is from a different problem where the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the example is correct. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut this seems contradictory. If the original problem is for every integer n, then the formatted problem's assumptions should not include \"n is divisible by 7\" unless there's a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. Maybe the user provided a different example where the original problem had \"for every integer n divisible by 7\". But in the example description, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$A(n)... is divisible by 91.\n\nThis is conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That's incorrect. The conclusion is that the example provided by the user is flawed. Therefore, when applying the format, I should be cautious. However, following the user's instruction, I need to follow the example's structure, even if it's incorrect. So in their example, they took the original problem which states \"for every integer n\" but added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user expects to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly stated as assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the problem was actually to prove for n divisible by 7, but the original problem was miswritten. Alternatively, the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, I need to proceed with the given instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving the integral equals 14ζ(3)/π². The problem mentions changing variables, but the main task is to prove the integral. Are there any assumptions listed? The original problem states \"It appears that...\" and provides the integral. The user is asking how to prove this result, checking if they overlooked anything trivial, and asks about generalizations. The problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to infinity, and the integrand being tanh²(x)/x². So perhaps the assumptions are that the integral converges, which it does, but maybe that's considered implicit. Alternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the integral setup. However, in the example, the user included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is that the integral is taken over the positive real line, and the function is integrable. But since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. Wait, the example included assumptions that were in the problem statement. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was translated to the assumption \"n is an integer\", and then added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is wrong, and the correct way is to list the assumptions as given in the problem. Therefore, in the current problem, the original problem's assumptions would be that the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is tanh²(x)/x². But since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no additional assumptions. However, in the problem statement, the user mentions changing variables, but that's part of the problem-solving process, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions here are just the integral setup. Alternatively, the substitution might require some conditions, like z being between 0 and 1, but that's part of the problem's transformation. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand function is tanh²(x)/x².\n\nBut since these are part of the problem statement, maybe the assumptions are not listed unless there are specific conditions. However, following the example, the user wants to list each assumption line by line. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" and then added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an extra assumption. This suggests that the user might want to extract any conditions from the problem statement as assumptions. However, in the current problem, the integral is already specified as from 0 to infinity, so perhaps the only assumption is that x is a real positive variable. But the problem doesn't state any restrictions beyond that. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions other than the integral's form. However, to follow the example, perhaps we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the domain from 0 to infinity.\n\nBut that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem is to evaluate the integral as given, so the problem statement is the integral itself. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions beyond what's in the problem. But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. So applying that logic, the integral's domain and the integrand are part of the problem, and the assumption might not need to be listed. Wait, no, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, the integral is given, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is defined, but since the problem is to evaluate it, maybe there are no additional assumptions. However, perhaps the substitution is part of the problem's given conditions, but the user transformed it into an equivalent form. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a positive real number.\n- The substitution x = -½ ln z is valid (i.e., z ∈ (0,1)).\n\nBut the problem doesn't state these as assumptions; it's part of the problem's transformation. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is to prove the integral equals the given value. In that case, the assumptions section might be empty, but the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, here, the assumption is that the integral converges, but that's implicit. Alternatively, since the integral is written as ∫₀^∞, the assumption is that the integral is over that interval. So following the example's style, where the original problem's conditions are listed as assumptions, here the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n\nBut that's redundant because the problem states it. However, in the example, \"n is an integer\" was listed as an assumption because the problem said \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, the integral's limits are part of the problem statement, so perhaps it's considered an assumption. Therefore, the assumption here is that the integral is over [0, ∞). But since the problem already states ∫₀^∞, maybe it's not necessary. However, to match the example's structure, perhaps we should list it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may have no assumptions beyond the integral as given. The example included an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which might have been a mistake. But since I need to follow the user's example, even if it's incorrect, I have to proceed accordingly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to list any conditions necessary for the integral to converge. For example, tanh²(x) behaves like 1 at infinity and like x² near 0, so the integrand behaves like 1/x² at infinity (which would diverge), but wait, tanh(x) approaches 1 as x→infty, so tanh²(x) approaches 1, so the integrand ~ 1/x², whose integral from, say, 1 to infinity, converges because ∫1/x² dx from 1 to ∞ is 1. Near 0, tanh(x) ~ x - x³/3 + ..., so tanh²(x) ~ x² - 2x⁴/3 + ..., so tanh²(x)/x² ~ 1 - 2x²/3 + ..., so the integrand approaches 1 as x→0, hence the integral near 0 behaves like ∫1 dx, which would diverge. Wait, but the original problem states that the integral equals 14ζ(3)/π², which is finite. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my analysis. Wait, tanh(x) ~ x for x near 0, so tanh²(x) ~ x², so tanh²(x)/x² ~ 1. Therefore, near x=0, the integrand is ~1, so ∫₀^ε 1 dx = ε, which converges as ε→0. Wait, no, the integral from 0 to some point of 1/x² would diverge, but here it's tanh²(x)/x² ~ 1 as x→0, so the integrand is ~1 near 0, so ∫₀^1 1 dx converges. From 1 to infinity, integrand ~1/x², which also converges. Therefore, the integral converges. Hence, the integral is well-defined, and the assumption is that the integral converges. But since the problem is to evaluate it, perhaps the assumption is just that the integral exists. However, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer (from the problem's \"for every integer n\"), so here, perhaps the assumption is that the integral is convergent. But the problem doesn't state this; it's part of the verification. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is simply to prove the equality. Hence, the formatted problem would have no assumptions. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's statement. Therefore, following the example, I should list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nHowever, the original problem also mentions the equivalent form after substitution, but that's part of the problem-solving steps, not the problem statement. The user is asking how to prove the result, so the main problem is the first integral. The other parts about generalization are further questions, but according to the user's instruction, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the main problem. The example included only the main problem, not the follow-up questions. Therefore, the formatted problem should focus on the main integral, and the assumptions would be related to that integral.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval from 0 to infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem also has the transformed integral after substitution. Should that be included? The example didn't include alternative forms. The user wants to \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes the problem statement. The original question has two integral forms claimed to be equivalent, but the main problem is to prove the first one equals 14ζ(3)/π². The substitution is part of the attempt. Therefore, the formatted problem should include only the main problem, with assumptions relevant to it. The equivalent integral is part of the solution approach, not the problem itself. Hence, the assumptions would be just the integral's domain and the integrand's form. But since the problem explicitly states the integral as given, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. In the example, the assumption was taken from the problem's quantifier (\"for every integer n\"), so here, perhaps there are no assumptions to list, because the problem is an integral without variables or quantifiers. However, the example's structure requires listing assumptions, so if there are none, perhaps we should state that. But the example had assumptions even when the problem was a universal statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, there are no explicit assumptions, so the assumption section is empty. But the example didn't have an empty assumption section. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that the integral converges. But the problem is to prove it equals a specific value, which implies convergence. Therefore, the assumption is that the integral is convergent. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $$\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state the assumption of convergence; it's part of what needs to be proven. So including it as an assumption would be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is simply to evaluate the integral. However, the example's structure requires listing assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. Therefore, to adhere to the example's format, perhaps we should list the integral's limits and integrand as assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function $\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}$ is integrated with respect to $x$,\nThe integration domain is from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions are the conditions under which the equality holds. Since the integral is presented as is, the only assumption is that the integral exists (converges). But proving convergence is often part of evaluating an integral. However, the problem states that the user has numerical evidence, so the convergence is assumed. Therefore, the assumption is that the integral converges. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx$$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $$\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Given the example's structure, where the original problem had \"for every integer n\" leading to assumption \"n is an integer\", here the problem's integral is over 0 to infinity, so maybe the assumption is that the integration limits are from 0 to infinity. But that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the example's extra assumption might have been a mistake, and the correct approach is to list only what's given in the problem. Given the confusion, I think the safest way is to follow the example as per the user's instruction, even if it's flawed. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then added another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that. Alternatively, maybe the example is from a different problem where the original did have those assumptions. Given that, I think the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement as separate assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's wording.\n\nIn the current problem, the main integral is ∫₀^∞ tanh²(x)/x² dx. The problem is to prove it equals 14ζ(3)/π². Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integration variable x ranges from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is tanh²(x)/x².\n\nBut these are part of the integral's notation. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" because the problem said \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, the integration limits are part of the problem statement, so the assumption is that x is integrated from 0 to infinity. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval from 0 to infinity.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is about the integral, the assumption is that the integral exists. But again, proving convergence is part of the problem. However, the user's example included an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Given this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list the main components as assumptions. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx$$ is convergent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nThis way, the assumption addresses the convergence, which is necessary for the integral to equal the given value. However, the original problem didn't state this assumption, but in rigorous analysis, proving convergence is part of the problem. But since the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's quantifier, maybe here we don't need to state convergence as an assumption. Perhaps the answer should have no assumptions, but the example requires listing them. Given the ambiguity, and to adhere to the example's structure where assumptions were listed even if part of the problem statement, I'll proceed with:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\tanh^2(x)}{x^2}dx=\\frac{14\\,\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2}.$$\n\nThis mirrors the example where the problem's quantifier became an assumption. Here, the integral's domain is stated in the problem, so it's an assumption. The other parts of the question about substitutions and generalizations are filtered out as unrelated for the main problem structure.",
