    "Content": "A finite set of distinct positive numbers is special if each integer in the set divides the sum of all integers within the set. Prove that every finite set of positive integers is a subset of some special set. What I Tried :- I tried to attack this problem by means of Contradiction. Suppose there dosen't exist a finite set of positive integers which is a subset of some special set . Let the set contain elements $(a_1,a_2,...,a_k)$ . Then there dosen't exist a bigger set with all the same elements than this set which is special. From here I couldn't go solving it  . Edit :- As small examples we have $(1,2,3)$ a special set ; hence $(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)$ are subsets of this set . For $(1,4)$ we have $(1,2,4,7,14)$ , although $6$ and $28$ are perfect numbers. If we have a set which is not a subset of the factors of a perfect number , say $(1,5)$ ; we still have a special set $(1,4,5,10)$ where $(1,5)$ lies at it's subset . I am not getting any clues or ways to get these special sets. Now can anyone help ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Say we're given a set $S$ , with sum $s$ . We assume that $S$ does not consist of only powers of $2$ ; if it does, we can simply add to the set the number $3$ . First, let $a$ be large enough so that $2^a > 2s$ , meaning $2^a - s \\not \\in S$ , and define $S' = S \\cup \\{2^a - s\\}$ , so $S'$ has sum $2^a$ . Let $n$ be the product of all elements of $S'$ , and let $b$ be large enough so that $2^b > n$ . We now construct a set $S''$ containing $S'$ with sum $2^{a+b} n$ , all elements of which divide $2^{a+b} n$ . Since $n-1$ is less than $2^b$ , using its binary representation we can express $n-1$ as a sum of distinct elements of $\\{1, 2, 4, \\dots, 2^{b-1}\\}$ , and thus we can express $2^a(n-1)$ as a sum of distinct elements of $\\{2^a, 2^{a+1}, \\dots, 2^{a+b-1}\\}$ . Let $T$ be the subset of elements appearing in the latter sum. Then define $$S'' = S' \\cup T \\cup \\{2^an, 2^{a+1}n, \\dots, 2^{a+b-1}n\\}.$$ As you can check, all elements of $S''$ divide $2^{a+b} n$ , and the three sets in this union are disjoint (since $n$ is not a power of $2$ ), and thus $S''$ has sum $2^a + 2^a(n-1) + (2^{a+b} n - 2^a n) = 2^{a+b} n$ , meaning $S''$ is special.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem based on the user's example. The original question is about proving that every finite set of positive integers is a subset of some special set, where a special set is defined as a finite set of distinct positive numbers where each integer divides the sum of all integers in the set.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentioned an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's look at the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states two main things: \n\n1. A finite set of distinct positive numbers is special if each integer in the set divides the sum of all integers within the set.\n2. Prove that every finite set of positive integers is a subset of some special set.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be the conditions that define a special set. Let me break them down:\n\n- The set is finite.\n- The set contains distinct positive integers.\n- For each element in the set, that element divides the sum of all elements in the set.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to the set. Then, the problem is to show that any given finite set of positive integers can be expanded (if necessary) to such a special set.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is listed as a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption: The set is finite,\nAssumption: The set contains distinct positive integers,\nAssumption: Each integer in the set divides the sum of all integers in the set.\n\nAnd the problem statement is to prove that every finite set of positive integers is a subset of some special set.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"every finite set of positive integers\", but the special set requires distinct elements. So maybe the original set might have duplicates? But the problem states \"positive integers\", which are distinct if it's a set, since sets have distinct elements. So maybe that's covered.\n\nBut in the assumptions for the special set, it's \"distinct positive numbers\". So the original set (which is a subset) can be any finite set of positive integers (which by definition are distinct in a set). Therefore, the key is that the special set must include the original set and also satisfy that each element divides the sum.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the three assumptions about the special set and then state the problem as proving every finite set is a subset of such a special set.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted the assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was for every integer n, but in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which actually changes the problem. Wait, maybe that example had a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually had n divisible by 7? Because otherwise, the example is incorrect. Maybe there was a typo. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to list the assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the special set must be finite, have distinct positive integers, and each divides the sum. So those are three separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that any finite set of positive integers is a subset of such a special set.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The set is finite,\nAssumption: The set contains distinct positive integers,\nAssumption: Each integer in the set divides the sum of all integers in the set.\nProblem: Prove that every finite set of positive integers is a subset of some special set.\n\nBut let me check if each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object. \"The set is finite\" - yes, one property (finiteness) of the set. \"The set contains distinct positive integers\" - another property (distinctness and positivity). \"Each integer in the set divides the sum of all integers in the set\" - each element (integer) in the set has the property that it divides the sum.\n\nSo yes, each of these is a separate condition. Therefore, this should be correct.",
