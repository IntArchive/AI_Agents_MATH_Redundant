Here a division algebra is an associative algebra where every nonzero number is invertible (like a field, but without assuming commutativity of multiplication).

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Essentially one first proves that any real division algebra $D$ is a Clifford algebra (i.e. it's generated by elements of some inner product vector space I subject to relations $v^2=\\langle v, v\\rangle$): first one splits $D$ as $\\mathbb R\\oplus D_0$ where $D_0$ is the space of elements with $Tr=0$ and then one observes that minimal polynomial of a traceless element has the form $x^2-a=0$ (it's quadratic because it's irreducible and the coefficient of $x$ is zero because it is the trace). Now it remains to find out which Clifford algebras are division algebras which is pretty straightforward (well, and it follows from the classification of Clifford algebras). This proof is written in Wikipedia.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is asking why the only associative division algebras over the real numbers are the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse through the question:\n\n1. The division algebra is associative.\n2. It's over the real numbers.\n3. Every nonzero element is invertible (definition of division algebra).\n4. The problem is about classifying such algebras.\n\nWait, the problem statement is actually to prove that the only ones are ℝ, ℂ, and ℍ. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Let me list them one by one:\n\n- The algebra is associative.\n- The algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element has an inverse).\n- The algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to the algebra in question. The problem then is to show that under these conditions, the only possibilities are the three mentioned.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have these three assumptions and then the problem statement. Let me check the example given to ensure consistency. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line. So here, each condition (associative, division algebra, over ℝ) is a separate assumption.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each property is distinct: associativity is a property of multiplication, division algebra is about invertibility, and being over ℝ is the base field. So three separate assumptions.\n\nI should verify if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"division algebras over the real numbers\" and \"associative\", so those are the key points. The question doesn't mention finite-dimensionality, but in the context of the Frobenius theorem, I think finite-dimensional is usually an assumption. Wait, but the original question doesn't state finite-dimensional. Hmm. Wait, but in the standard Frobenius theorem, the division algebras are finite-dimensional over ℝ. The user's question says \"the only associative division algebras over the real numbers\" but maybe they're assuming finite-dimensional? Because otherwise, there might be infinite-dimensional examples. However, the classic Frobenius result is about finite-dimensional ones. The user might have omitted that, but perhaps it's part of the standard understanding. However, since the user is quoting the result as being by Frobenius, which does require finite-dimensional, I should check if the original problem mentions finite-dimensional. The original question here says: \"Why are the only (associative) division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions?\" It does not specify finite-dimensional, but historically, the Frobenius theorem is about finite-dimensional real division algebras. So maybe the user is assuming finite-dimensional, but it's not stated. However, the problem as posed does not include that as an explicit assumption. Therefore, should we include it in the assumptions? Wait, the user's example only included the explicit assumptions from the problem. The original problem here might have an implicit assumption of finite-dimensional, but if it's not stated, should we add it? The user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem based on the given content. The original problem does not mention finite-dimensional, so maybe the answer should not include that as an assumption. However, without finite-dimensional, the statement is false because there are infinite-dimensional division algebras. Therefore, perhaps the user made an omission, but since we are supposed to structure the problem as given, we have to go by the original question's wording. Wait, the original question is: \"Why are the only (associative) division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions?\" So in their problem statement, they don't mention finite-dimensional, but in reality, the theorem requires finite-dimensional. Therefore, maybe the user's problem is missing that, but since they are quoting Frobenius' theorem, which does require finite-dimensional, perhaps that is an implicit assumption. But the user's original problem does not state it. Therefore, do we need to include finite-dimensional as an assumption?\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. Since the user wants us to structure the problem based on the given content, and the given question does not mention finite-dimensional, maybe we shouldn't include it. However, in reality, the theorem requires finite-dimensional. But according to the user's example, they included assumptions that were explicitly stated. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example seems incorrect. Wait, looking back: the original example was a problem where the user had to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error because if the original problem was for every integer n, then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is an added restriction. That example might be a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the formatted problem shouldn't add an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Therefore, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example.\n\nIn any case, following the user's instructions, they want us to structure the problem as per the given content, filtering unrelated information. So for the current problem, even if the original theorem requires finite-dimensional, if the user's question does not state it, we should not include it as an assumption. However, the problem as stated is incorrect unless finite-dimensional is assumed. Therefore, there is a conflict here. Maybe the user intended to include finite-dimensionality but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the original problem on Math Stack Exchange included it. Wait, looking back at the user's input:\n\nThe original question on Math Stack Exchange is titled: \"Why are the only associative division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions?\"\n\nThe question body says: \"Why are the only (associative) division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions? Here a division algebra is an associative algebra where every nonzero number is invertible (like a field, but without assuming commutativity of multiplication). This is an old result proved by Frobenius, but I can't remember how the argument goes. Anyone have a quick proof?\"\n\nIn the user's presented problem, the division algebra is defined as associative and every nonzero element is invertible. The base field is real numbers. The classic Frobenius theorem is about finite-dimensional associative division algebras over ℝ. Therefore, the user's problem likely has an implicit assumption that the algebra is finite-dimensional. But since the user didn't specify, do we include it?\n\nThe user's instruction is to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. Since the original problem does not mention finite-dimensional, but the result is about finite-dimensional algebras, perhaps the user made a mistake. However, we are supposed to structure based on the given content. Therefore, unless the original problem mentions finite-dimensional, we shouldn't add it. But that would make the problem incorrect. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the definition of a division algebra, sometimes it's assumed to be finite-dimensional. But I don't think so. A division algebra is just an algebra where every non-zero element is invertible, regardless of dimension. So the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions are finite-dimensional, but there might be infinite-dimensional ones. Therefore, the theorem must include finite-dimensional as a condition.\n\nSince the original problem is referring to Frobenius' result, which is about finite-dimensional algebras, the user is likely assuming finite-dimensional, even if they didn't state it. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, we need to include finite-dimensional as an assumption. But since the user's original problem didn't state it, should we? The user's instruction says to filter unrelated information, so maybe we need to infer based on the context. Since the answer to the question requires finite-dimensional, and the user mentions Frobenius, who proved the finite-dimensional case, the assumption of finite-dimensional is necessary. Therefore, even though the user didn't state it, perhaps we should include it as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user considers it part of \"over the real numbers,\" but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement in Vietnamese or the original context includes finite-dimensional. But according to the given input, the problem is as presented. So the user is asking to structure the problem based on the given Math Stack Exchange question. The given Math Stack Exchange question does not mention finite-dimensional. Therefore, if we follow the example, we should only list the assumptions explicitly stated in the problem. In the example, the user had added an assumption not present in the original problem (the original problem said \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\"), but that might have been an error.\n\nWait, let me check the example again. The original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which restricts n. That seems contradictory. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, and their actual intention is different. Maybe the example should have included the implicit assumptions from the problem. For instance, if the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the assumptions are that n is an integer and divisible by both 7 and 13? But the user's example only says \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be an error.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the user's actual intention is to list all the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem, but the example was incorrect. Therefore, returning to the current problem, the original question mentions:\n\n- associative division algebras over the real numbers.\n\nIn the definition, a division algebra is an associative algebra where every nonzero element is invertible. The problem is to show that the only such algebras are ℝ, ℂ, ℍ.\n\nThe standard theorem requires finite-dimensional. So perhaps the user missed that. But if we are to follow the original problem's text strictly, then we can only list the assumptions given. The problem says \"division algebras over the real numbers\", so the base field is real numbers. The algebra is associative. The division algebra condition (every nonzero element invertible) is given.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The algebra is associative.\n2. The algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible).\n3. The algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nBut since the theorem is false without finite-dimensional, maybe we need to include it. However, since it's not mentioned in the problem, perhaps the user expects us to not include it. Alternatively, maybe the definition of division algebra in the problem includes finite-dimensional. But in the problem's own definition, it's just an associative algebra where every nonzero element is invertible. So unless stated, it's not necessarily finite-dimensional.\n\nThis is a problem. The answer hinges on finite-dimensionality. So either the problem has a missing assumption, or the user is mistaken. But since we are to structure the problem as given, we can only go by what's written. Therefore, perhaps the answer will include the three assumptions as above, even though in reality, the theorem needs finite-dimensional. Alternatively, maybe in the context of division algebras over ℝ, the default is finite-dimensional. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking up Frobenius' theorem: Yes, it specifically classifies finite-dimensional associative division algebras over ℝ. Therefore, finite-dimensional is a necessary condition. But the original problem does not mention it, which is an oversight. Therefore, if we are to structure the problem correctly, we should include finite-dimensional as an assumption, even if the user didn't state it. Because otherwise, the problem is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\n1. The algebra is associative.\n2. The algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible).\n3. The algebra is over the real numbers.\n4. The algebra is finite-dimensional.\n\nBut since the original problem doesn't state the fourth point, but the theorem requires it, we need to include it. However, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure based on the given problem. Since the user's given problem does not mention finite-dimensional, we are in a quandary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and the answer would be that in addition to the listed assumptions, finite-dimensionality is required. But the user wants us to structure the problem as per the original question, not to correct it. Therefore, even if the original question is missing an assumption, we should only include what's there.\n\nGiven that, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The algebra is associative.\n- The algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible).\n- The algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the only such algebras are ℝ, ℂ, ℍ.\n\nBut then the problem is technically incorrect because there are infinite-dimensional examples. However, the user is citing Frobenius' theorem, which is about finite-dimensional ones. Therefore, the user likely intended finite-dimensional, but forgot to mention it. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we need to decide whether to include it.\n\nThe user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), which might indicate that in their example, they made a mistake, but perhaps their intention is to list all necessary assumptions, even if implicit. Alternatively, maybe the example was a different problem where divisibility by 7 was part of the original assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's example was a mistake, and we should not follow it. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, we should list the assumptions as given in the original question, even if incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, which in their case added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem's statement (which said \"for every integer n\"), perhaps they are actually instructing us to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they list \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. The original problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. If the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7, then the problem becomes \"Prove that if n is an integer divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91\". But the original problem was for all integers n. So the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, and the correct approach is to list only the assumptions given in the problem. However, given the confusion, perhaps the user intended to extract all conditions from the problem, including any that are necessary for the conclusion, even if not explicitly stated.\n\nBut that would require domain knowledge. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated information\", and \"structure that problem\" as per the example, but the example seems flawed. Therefore, the safest path is to list the assumptions as explicitly mentioned in the problem, even if in reality more are needed.\n\nIn the original question, the problem is: Why are the only associative division algebras over the real numbers the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions? The user defines a division algebra as an associative algebra where every nonzero element is invertible. The base field is real numbers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The algebra is associative.\n- The algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible).\n- The algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem with these three assumptions. Even though in reality, finite-dimensional is needed, but since it's not mentioned, we omit it. The user is likely aware of the standard theorem and expects the answer to align with that, but the problem as posed is missing that condition. However, following the instructions strictly, we proceed with the given information.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe algebra is associative,\nThe algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible),\nThe algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only such algebras are the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions.\n\nBut given the example included a mistaken assumption, maybe the user expects us to include the finite-dimensional condition. But without explicit mention, it's hard to say. However, given the original problem's reference to Frobenius' result, which is finite-dimensional, perhaps we should include finite-dimensional as an assumption. But since the user didn't state it, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that being a division algebra over ℝ implies finite-dimensional, but that's not standard. Therefore, given the ambiguity, but following the user's example (even if it's incorrect), I will proceed to list the assumptions as given in the problem, even if incomplete. However, to ensure correctness, maybe include finite-dimensional. But this is a judgment call.\n\nSince the user's example added an assumption not in the original problem, perhaps the user expects us to include all necessary assumptions, even if not explicitly stated. Therefore, in this case, finite-dimensional is necessary for the theorem to hold, so we should include it. But since the original problem doesn't state it, how to handle this?\n\nThe user's instruction is to \"filter unrelated informations\". The original problem doesn't mention finite-dimensional, so it's not unrelated. However, in order for the theorem to be true, it is related. But perhaps the user wants only the assumptions mentioned in the problem. Therefore, strictly following the problem, the answer is as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe algebra is associative,\nThe algebra is a division algebra (every nonzero element is invertible),\nThe algebra is over the real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the only such algebras are the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions.\n\nHowever, in reality, this is incomplete. But according to the user's example, they modified the problem's assumptions (added n divisible by 7) even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user expects that we extract the conditions from the problem statement, even if they are not all explicitly listed. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added that n must be divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, I think the user's example is incorrect, and the actual instruction is to list the assumptions as given in the problem, not to add new ones. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions are as given in the problem statement: associative, division algebra, over ℝ. Even if in reality finite-dimensional is required, but the problem doesn't mention it.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with that.",
