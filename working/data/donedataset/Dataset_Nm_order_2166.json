    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will begin with the same approach as in @DavidG 's answer, but will settle in a different argument. Let $$ J(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{arsinh}(tx)}{1+x^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x. $$ Our goal is to compute $J(2)$ using Feynman's trick. Differentiating $J(t)$ and substituting $x=\\sqrt{u^{-2}-1}$ , we obtain \\begin{align*}\nJ'(t)\n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x}{(1+x^2)\\sqrt{1+t^2x^2}} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n= \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (1-t^2)(1-u^2)}} \\, \\mathrm{d}u.\n\\end{align*} So it follows that \\begin{align*}\nJ(2)\n&= \\int_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (1-t^2)(1-u^2)}} \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}t \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (1-t^2)(1-u^2)}} \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}t\n+ \\int_{1}^{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (t^2-1)(1-u^2)}} \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}t.\n\\end{align*} The inner integral is easily computed, yielding \\begin{align*}\nJ(2)\n&= \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\operatorname{artanh}\\left( \\sqrt{1 - t^2} \\right)}{\\sqrt{1 - t^2}} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n+ \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{t^2-1}\\right)}{\\sqrt{t^2 - 1}} \\, \\mathrm{d}t.\n\\end{align*} Now we substitute $t = \\operatorname{sech} \\varphi$ for the first integral and $t = \\sec \\theta$ for the second integral. This yields \\begin{align*}\nJ(2)\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varphi}{\\cosh\\varphi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi\n+ \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\frac{\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta.\n\\end{align*} These integrals can be computed as follows: Using $ \\operatorname{sech}\\varphi = \\frac{2e^{-\\varphi}}{1 + e^{-2\\varphi}} = 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n e^{-(2n+1)\\varphi} $ , we obtain $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varphi}{\\cosh\\varphi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi\n= 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\varphi e^{-(2n+1)\\varphi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi\n= 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^2}\n= 2G. $$ Taking integration by parts, \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\frac{\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n&= \\left[ - \\theta \\log \\left( \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} + \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\log \\left( \\tan \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\right)   \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\log \\left( 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\right) + 2 \\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\log \\left( \\tan \\theta \\right)   \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta.\n\\end{align*} This can be computed by using the Fourier series $\\log \\left( \\tan \\theta \\right) = - 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos(4n+2)\\theta}{2n+1} $ to yield \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\frac{\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\log \\left( 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\right) - 2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} (2n+1) \\right) - \\sin\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6} (2n+1) \\right)}{(2n+1)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\log \\left( 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\right) - \\frac{2}{3}G.\n\\end{align*} Combining two result, we obtain the desired answer.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is about evaluating the integral ∫₀^{π/2} arcsinh(2 tan x) dx and proving it equals (4/3)G + (1/3)π ln(2+√3), where G is Catalan's constant. The user also mentions an attempt involving substitution and transforming the integral into different forms, leading to a series involving hyperbolic functions, but they couldn't proceed further.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the problem, the integral is from 0 to π/2, the integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x), and the result involves Catalan's constant and a logarithmic term. The assumptions here would include the limits of integration, the function being integrated, and any conditions mentioned. The original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions or constraints beyond the integral itself, so the main assumptions would be the integral's bounds and the form of the integrand. However, in their attempt, they transformed the integral into another form using substitution (like x = tan x, leading to ∫₀^∞ arcsinh(2x)/(1+x²) dx). But in the problem statement, do these transformations count as assumptions? Wait, the example given in the original instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, no, in the example, the user might have made a mistake. Wait, looking at the original example: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So perhaps the example had a mistake? Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But the example's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems to be an added condition. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction, which in the example, they extracted assumptions from the problem. So perhaps in the original problem, the user had a typo or maybe the actual problem required n to be divisible by 7. Hmm. Maybe the original problem had a different condition. But regardless, the user provided an example where the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. So, in their example, they split the problem's conditions into separate assumptions.\n\nSo applying that logic here, the integral is from 0 to π/2, the integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x), and the problem is to evaluate it and show it's equal to that expression. The assumptions here would be the limits of integration (0 and π/2), the integrand being arcsinh(2 tan x), and perhaps the substitution steps mentioned in the attempt. Wait, but the user's example only included the problem's inherent assumptions, not the attempt's steps. So in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer, but the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. But since the user provided that example, I have to follow their structure. So perhaps in their example, the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumptions were n being an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe the original problem was for n divisible by 7. Therefore, when formatting, we need to list all the inherent assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to π/2, the integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x), and the desired result involves Catalan's constant. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x).\n- The result involves Catalan's constant G and π ln(2 + √3).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So the integral bounds are one assumption, the integrand is another, and perhaps the relation to G and the logarithmic term is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove the integral equals that expression, so the existence of G and the logarithmic term is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. Therefore, the only assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's form. Additionally, if there are any substitutions or conditions used in the problem's setup, but the user's attempt mentions substitutions, but those are part of their solution attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. Therefore, the original problem's assumptions are just:\n\n- The integral is taken from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x).\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\nThe integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x).\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\operatorname{arcsinh}(2\\tan x)\\,dx = \\frac{4}{3}G + \\frac{1}{3}\\pi\\ln\\left(2+\\sqrt{3}\\right),$$\nwhere $G$ is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, they included the divisibility by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example was incorrect, but following that, perhaps here we need to list all the components. Wait, the example might have been a mistake where the original problem didn't specify n divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that. That would be an error. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but I should follow their instruction to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The Math Stack Exchange question here doesn't specify any assumptions other than the integral itself. Therefore, the assumptions would be the integral's bounds and integrand. However, the problem is to evaluate the integral, so those are the given conditions. Hence, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions.\n\nSo final answer:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\nThe integrand is arcsinh(2 tan x).\n\nProblem: Prove that\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\operatorname{arcsinh}(2\\tan x)\\,dx = \\frac{4}{3}G + \\frac{1}{3}\\pi\\ln\\left(2+\\sqrt{3}\\right),$$\nwhere $G$ is Catalan's constant.\n\nBut checking the original problem again: The user mentioned in their attempt transforming the integral, but those steps are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So those shouldn't be included. Therefore, the assumptions are only what's given in the problem statement, which is the integral from 0 to π/2 of arcsinh(2 tan x) dx. The problem is to prove it equals that expression involving G and pi ln(...). So the formatted problem should capture that.",
