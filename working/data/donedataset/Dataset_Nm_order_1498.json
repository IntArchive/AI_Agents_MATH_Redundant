    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully. The user is asking about proving an integral result. The integral is from 0 to π/3 of [ (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ ]^(1/2) * cosθ dθ, and it's supposed to equal π√3/(8√2). They mentioned using FORTRAN and the trapezoid rule for numerical integration, which gives strong evidence for the result. But the main task is to prove it analytically.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions the integral is from 0 to π/3. The integrand is a product of two main parts: the square root of (√3 cosθ - sinθ) multiplied by sinθ, all raised to the 1/2 power, and then multiplied by cosθ. So, the variables and functions involved here are θ, with θ ranging between 0 and π/3. The functions involved are cosθ, sinθ, and combinations thereof.\n\nLet me check if there are any hidden assumptions or conditions. The problem states that the integral is definite, from 0 to π/3. The integrand must be real and defined over this interval. Since we have a square root, the expression inside must be non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3]. So, I need to verify if (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative in this interval. Let me test θ=0: sinθ is 0, so the expression is 0. At θ=π/3: sin(π/3)=√3/2, cos(π/3)=1/2. Then √3*(1/2) - √3/2 = 0. So again, the expression inside the square root becomes 0. So, between 0 and π/3, we need to check if (√3 cosθ - sinθ) is positive when multiplied by sinθ. Let's pick θ=π/6: sinθ=1/2, cosθ=√3/2. Then √3*(√3/2) -1/2 = (3/2 -1/2)=1. Multiply by sinθ=1/2 gives 1*(1/2)=1/2, which is positive. So in between 0 and π/3, the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Therefore, the integrand is real and defined here. So an assumption would be that the integrand is real-valued over [0, π/3], which relies on (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ ≥ 0 for θ in [0, π/3]. However, maybe the problem assumes that this holds, so perhaps we can list that as an assumption.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user doesn't state this; they just present the integral. So maybe we need to include that (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative on [0, π/3] as an assumption, but actually, it's part of the problem's conditions. However, according to the example provided, the assumptions are the given conditions. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That's a mistake. Wait, the user's example might have an error. Wait, the original example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's inconsistent with the original problem. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should not restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the example was intended to show how to extract specific assumptions. But perhaps the original problem was different. Maybe there was a misformatting.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's instructions, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. In the current problem, the integral is definite from 0 to π/3, and the integrand has specific components. The assumptions should list each condition that is given. So for example, the limits of integration, the integrand's form, and any conditions needed for the integrand to be defined. Since the user didn't mention verifying the integrand's domain, but the problem is presented as given, perhaps the key assumptions are the interval [0, π/3], the structure of the integrand, and maybe that θ is a real variable in that interval. So let's list the assumptions:\n\n1. The integral is over the interval [0, π/3].\n2. The integrand is [(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ]^(1/2) * cosθ.\n3. The expression inside the square root, (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ, is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut perhaps the third point is part of the problem's conditions, so it's an assumption that the integrand is real-valued. Alternatively, since the problem states the integral as given, maybe we just need to mention the interval and the structure of the integrand. However, since the square root requires the argument to be non-negative, that is a necessary condition for the integrand to be real, hence an implicit assumption. But the original question doesn't state this; it's part of the problem's setup. So perhaps we should include it as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that θ is in [0, π/3], and the functions involved are trigonometric functions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- θ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3].\n- The integrand is [(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ]^(1/2) * cosθ.\n- The expression inside the square root is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because the problem states the integral exists and equals the given value, implying that the integrand is real and integrable. However, to be thorough, it's better to list all necessary conditions.\n\nWait, the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange says: \"Show that [integral] = ...\". So the problem is to compute the integral, which implies that the integral exists and is equal to that value. So the user is not asking about the conditions for the integral to exist, but to compute it. Therefore, the assumptions would be the integral is taken over [0, π/3], and the integrand is as given. The non-negativity inside the square root is part of the problem's setup, but since the problem is presented as given, maybe we don't need to list it as an assumption unless it's explicitly required. However, the example given by the user included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user's example had a mistake, or maybe they wanted to structure assumptions as given conditions. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- θ is a real number in the interval [0, π/3].\n- The integrand is [(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ]^(1/2) * cosθ.\n- The integral is evaluated over [0, π/3].\n\nBut θ is the variable of integration, so it's already covered by the integral's limits. Maybe the key assumptions are just the integral's limits and the form of the integrand. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute the integral, perhaps the only assumptions are the integral's definition. But perhaps more precise:\n\nLet me check the example again. The original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem was for n divisible by 7. But assuming the user provided the example correctly, perhaps the task is to extract all the conditions mentioned in the problem. So if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" then the assumption is \"n is an integer.\" But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their instructions regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The problem is to show that the integral equals the given value. So the assumptions would be the integral is from 0 to π/3, the integrand is as given, and the functions involved are real-valued (ensuring the square root is valid). However, since the problem is presented as is, maybe the key assumptions are just the integral's limits and the integrand's form. The non-negativity inside the square root is part of ensuring the integrand is real, which is necessary for the integral to make sense, so perhaps that's an implicit assumption. But the problem doesn't mention it, so maybe we need to list it as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can phrase the assumptions as:\n\n- The variable θ is in the interval [0, π/3].\n- The integrand involves the expression √[ (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ ] multiplied by cosθ.\n- The expression under the square root is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut maybe the third point is redundant if we accept that the integral is given and the user has numerically evaluated it. However, since the problem is to prove the integral analytically, the conditions for the integrand to be real are necessary. So to make the problem well-posed, we need to include that the expression inside the square root is non-negative on the interval. Hence, that should be an assumption.\n\nSo listing each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is [(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ]^(1/2) * cosθ,\nThe expression (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut wait, the third assumption is a consequence of θ being in [0, π/3], so maybe it's redundant. But to be thorough, we should include it as a separate assumption because it's a necessary condition for the square root to be real. Alternatively, since the problem presents the integral as given, perhaps we can assume that the integrand is real and defined over the interval, so we can list that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break down the components:\n\n- The integral is taken over θ from 0 to π/3.\n- The integrand is the product of √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} and cosθ.\n- The expression inside the square root, (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ, is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut maybe the third point can be merged with the first. But according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So each line should be a separate assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} * cosθ,\nThe expression (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut the third assumption ensures the square root is real, which is necessary for the integrand to be real. So those are the key points.\n\nThe problem then is to show that this integral equals π√3/(8√2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nθ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} * cosθ,\nThe expression (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nProblem:\nShow that\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\!\\!\n\\big((\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\vartheta-\\sin\\vartheta)\\sin\\vartheta\\big)^{\\!1/2}\\!\\cos\\vartheta \\,d\\vartheta\n=\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8\\sqrt{2}}. \n$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, they used theta (θ), but here we can keep it as theta. Also, the variables are dummies, so the symbol is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem uses theta, we can use theta in the assumptions. However, since theta is the integration variable, perhaps the first assumption is redundant, but the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, we need to list each assumption explicitly.\n\nAnother angle: The example's original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\", but then they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, split into individual lines. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to π/3.\n- The integrand is [(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ]^(1/2) * cosθ.\n\nBecause those are the given conditions. The non-negativity inside the square root is a consequence of the integral being well-defined, so it's an implicit assumption, but perhaps not explicitly stated. However, the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which suggests that perhaps the user wants to include all necessary conditions, even if they are implicit. Therefore, to mirror the example, even if the original problem doesn't state certain conditions, we should list them as assumptions if they are necessary for the problem to be valid.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which contradicts. That must be a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the explicit assumptions given in the problem. In the current problem, the integral is from 0 to π/3, and the integrand is as given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/3.\n- The integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} multiplied by cosθ.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{ (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ } * cosθ.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's style, where each assumption is one line addressing one property of one object. For example, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate assumptions. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is π/3,\nThe integrand includes the square root of (√3 cosθ - sinθ) multiplied by sinθ,\nThe integrand is multiplied by cosθ,\nThe expression inside the square root is non-negative for θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut that's getting too granular. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are the integral's limits and the form of the integrand. The non-negativity is a derived condition, so maybe it's part of the problem's context but not an assumption. Since the problem presents the integral as valid, we can take the integrand as well-defined over the interval, hence the non-negativity is implicitly assumed.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nθ ranges from 0 to π/3,\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} * cosθ.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here, the integral is over θ from 0 to π/3, so θ is in [0, π/3], which is one assumption. The integrand's form is another assumption. However, since the integrand is a single expression, maybe it's one assumption. But the example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into two lines. Therefore, perhaps each component of the integrand that's a condition on an object should be a separate assumption. But the integrand is a single expression. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} multiplied by cosθ,\nThe expression inside the square root is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\n\nBut again, the third assumption is a consequence of θ being in [0, π/3], but to be explicit, we can list it. However, in the example, they added an assumption not present in the original problem. So perhaps the user expects us to list all necessary conditions, even if they are implicit. Therefore, to be safe, include all three.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to show that the integral equals π√3/(8√2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nθ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ} * cosθ,\nThe expression (√3 cosθ - sinθ) sinθ is non-negative for all θ in [0, π/3].\nProblem:\nShow that \n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\!\\!\n\\big((\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\vartheta-\\sin\\vartheta)\\sin\\vartheta\\big)^{\\!1/2}\\!\\cos\\vartheta \\,d\\vartheta\n=\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8\\sqrt{2}}.$$\n###\n\nBut I need to check if the variables are named consistently. The original problem uses theta (ϑ), but in the formatted problem, we can use theta (θ) for consistency. However, in the original question, the user wrote:\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\!\\!\n\\big((\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\vartheta-\\sin\\vartheta)\\sin\\vartheta\\big)^{\\!1/2}\\!\\cos\\vartheta \\,d\\vartheta\n=\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8\\sqrt{2}}. \n$$\n\nThey used \\vartheta (which is ϑ) instead of theta (θ). But in LaTeX, \\vartheta is a variant symbol for theta. So perhaps we should keep the same symbol as in the original problem. Therefore, the assumptions should use \\vartheta instead of θ.\n\nSo adjusting:\n\nAssumption: \nϑ is a real variable in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe integrand is √{(√3 cosϑ - sinϑ) sinϑ} * cosϑ,\nThe expression (√3 cosϑ - sinϑ) sinϑ is non-negative for all ϑ in [0, π/3].\nProblem:\nShow that \n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\!\\!\n\\big((\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\vartheta-\\sin\\vartheta)\\sin\\vartheta\\big)^{\\!1/2}\\!\\cos\\vartheta \\,d\\vartheta\n=\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8\\sqrt{2}}.$$\n###\n\nBut in the problem statement, the variable is ϑ, so the assumptions should refer to ϑ, not θ. That's important for consistency.\n\nAdditionally, in the integrand, the expression inside the square root is (√3 cosϑ - sinϑ) sinϑ. So each part of the integrand should be accurately represented.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should use ϑ as the variable and list the assumptions with ϑ.",
