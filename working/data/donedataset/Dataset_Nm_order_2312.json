Prove that $AB\\cdot CD\\geq2S$ . This question was the last question from a mock exam a few days ago. To clarify, this exam is contest-style and for 7-8th graders. My approach: I immediately noticed that $2S=AC\\cdot MD\\sin\\alpha$ , where $\\alpha$ is the angle between $AC$ and $MD$ . Hence, it suffices to prove that $AB\\cdot CD\\geq AC\\cdot MD$ , since $\\sin\\alpha\\leq1$ . This is then equivalent to $\\dfrac{AB}{AC}\\geq\\dfrac{DM}{DC}$ . However, I am not sure how do approach the problem from here. Any help on solving this using (preferably) synthetic geometry will be appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $N$ be the midpoint of $CD$ . Note that $MN=\\frac 12 CD$ as $\\angle CMD=90^\\circ$ . Let $MN$ intersect $AB$ at $X$ . Note that $$AB \\cdot CD = 2AB\\cdot MN \\ge 2 AB \\cdot MN \\cdot \\sin \\angle AXN = 4[AMBN]$$ and it remains to show that $2[AMBN]=[AMCD]$ . But this is very easy: we have $$[AMBN]=[ABN]-[ABM]=\\frac 12[ABCD]-\\frac13 [ABC]$$ and $$[AMCD]=[ABCD]-[ABCM]=[ABCD]-\\frac 23 [ABC].$$ Done! Addendum. There are other possible configurations of points. For instance, it may happen that points $A$ and $D$ lie on different halfplanes determined by $CM$ . Similar ideas work: as before we have $AB \\cdot CD \\ge 4[AMBN]$ . Note that $[ABN]=[ABD]−[ANBD]=[ACBN]−[ACB]$ , so taking the average and using $[ANBD]=[ACBN]$ we get $$[ABN]=\\frac 12 \\Big([ABD]−[ANBD]+[ACBN]−[ACB]\\Big)=\\frac 12 \\Big([ABD]−[ACB]\\Big).$$ Therefore $$[AMBN]=[ABN]+[AMB]=\\frac 12\\Big([ABD] - [ACB]\\Big) + \\frac 13[ACB] = \\frac 12 [ABD]-\\frac 16 [ACB].$$ and $$[AMCD]=[ACD]-[ACM]=[ABD]-\\frac 13[ACB],$$ which shows that $2[AMBN]=[AMCD]$ . Yet another configuration: points $A$ and $D$ lie on the same halfplane determined by $CM$ and segments $CD$ , $AM$ intersect. Then we have simply $$AB \\cdot CD \\ge 2[ACBD] > 2[ACMD].$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about proving that in a certain geometric configuration, the product of AB and CD is at least twice the area of quadrilateral AMCD. The user mentioned using synthetic geometry, so I need to visualize the setup first.\n\nFirst, the given information: M is the centroid of triangle ABC. So, I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Then, point D is on a line through A that's parallel to BC. Hmm, so that line is parallel to BC and passes through A. Let me sketch this mentally. Triangle ABC with centroid M. Line through A parallel to BC, so if BC is the base, this line would be above A, right? Wait, no, direction depends on the triangle, but maybe it's better to assign coordinates to make it concrete.\n\nThe angle CMD is 90 degrees. So, point D is such that when you connect C to M to D, the angle at M is a right angle. S is the area of quadrilateral AMCD. Need to prove AB·CD ≥ 2S.\n\nThe user's approach was to express 2S as AC·MD·sinα, where α is the angle between AC and MD. Then they reduced the problem to showing AB·CD ≥ AC·MD, since sinα ≤1. So the key inequality becomes AB/AC ≥ DM/DC.\n\nHmm, maybe coordinates can help here. Let me try assigning coordinates to the triangle. Let's place point A at (0,0), B at (b,0), and C at (c,d). Then centroid M would be at ((b+c)/3, d/3). The line through A parallel to BC: the slope of BC is (d - 0)/(c - b) = d/(c - b). So the line through A with the same slope would be y = (d/(c - b))x. Wait, but the line through A parallel to BC should have the same slope as BC. But BC goes from B to C, so direction vector is (c - b, d). So the line through A parallel to BC would be parametric: starting at A(0,0), moving in direction (c - b, d). But maybe using coordinates complicates it for synthetic geometry.\n\nAlternatively, use properties of centroids and parallelograms. Since D is on the line through A parallel to BC, then AD is parallel to BC. Maybe construct some parallelogram here? If AD is parallel to BC, and if we could relate lengths using centroid properties.\n\nAlso, angle CMD is 90 degrees. So triangle CMD is right-angled at M. Maybe using coordinate geometry here would help. Let's set coordinates again. Let me set coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (2,0), C at (0,2) to make it simple. Then centroid M would be at ((2+0+0)/3, (0+0+2)/3) = (2/3, 2/3). The line through A parallel to BC: BC goes from (2,0) to (0,2), so slope is -1. So the line through A parallel to BC is y = -x. Wait, but BC is from B(2,0) to C(0,2), so slope is (2-0)/(0-2) = -1. So line through A(0,0) with slope -1 is y = -x. So point D is somewhere on y = -x. Let me denote D as (t, -t) for some t.\n\nNow, angle CMD is 90 degrees. So vectors CM and DM should be perpendicular. Let's compute coordinates. Point C is (0,2), M is (2/3, 2/3). Vector CM is M - C = (2/3 - 0, 2/3 - 2) = (2/3, -4/3). Point D is (t, -t), so vector DM is M - D = (2/3 - t, 2/3 - (-t)) = (2/3 - t, 2/3 + t). The dot product of CM and DM should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:\n\n(2/3)(2/3 - t) + (-4/3)(2/3 + t) = 0\n\nCompute this:\n\n(4/9 - 2t/3) + (-8/9 -4t/3) = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(4/9 -8/9) + (-2t/3 -4t/3) = 0\n\n(-4/9) + (-6t/3) = 0\n\n-4/9 -2t = 0\n\n-2t = 4/9\n\nt = -2/9\n\nSo D is (-2/9, 2/9). Wait, but in my coordinate system, the line through A parallel to BC is y = -x, so D is on that line. So coordinates are (t, -t), but according to calculation, t = -2/9, so D is (-2/9, 2/9). Let me verify the vectors:\n\nCM = (2/3, -4/3)\n\nDM = M - D = (2/3 - (-2/9), 2/3 - 2/9) = (2/3 + 2/9, 6/9 - 2/9) = (8/9, 4/9)\n\nDot product of CM and DM: (2/3)(8/9) + (-4/3)(4/9) = 16/27 - 16/27 = 0. Correct.\n\nNow, compute S = area of AMCD. Points A(0,0), M(2/3,2/3), C(0,2), D(-2/9, 2/9). Let's list the coordinates in order: A, M, C, D. To find the area of quadrilateral AMCD, can use shoelace formula.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nM: (2/3, 2/3)\n\nC: (0,2)\n\nD: (-2/9, 2/9)\n\nBack to A: (0,0)\n\nCompute shoelace sum:\n\nSum1 = (0)*(2/3) + (2/3)*2 + (0)*(2/9) + (-2/9)*0 = 0 + (4/3) + 0 + 0 = 4/3\n\nSum2 = 0*(2/3) + (2/3)*0 + 2*(-2/9) + (2/9)*0 = 0 + 0 -4/9 + 0 = -4/9\n\nArea S = |Sum1 - Sum2| / 2 = |4/3 - (-4/9)| /2 = |4/3 +4/9| /2 = |16/9| /2 = 8/9.\n\nNow compute AB·CD. AB is distance from A(0,0) to B(2,0): 2 units.\n\nCD is distance from C(0,2) to D(-2/9, 2/9): sqrt[(-2/9 -0)^2 + (2/9 -2)^2] = sqrt[(4/81) + ( -16/9)^2] = sqrt[4/81 + 256/81] = sqrt[260/81] = sqrt(260)/9 ≈ 16.12/9 ≈ 1.79.\n\nSo AB·CD ≈ 2 * 1.79 ≈ 3.58. 2S = 2*(8/9) ≈ 1.78. So 3.58 ≥ 1.78 holds. So in this specific case, the inequality holds.\n\nBut this is just an example. Need to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector methods or coordinate geometry is a way, but the problem is for 7-8th graders, so synthetic methods are preferred.\n\nLet me think again. Since M is the centroid, AM is a median. The line through A parallel to BC: maybe triangle ABC and the line AD form some similar triangles?\n\nAlternatively, since AD is parallel to BC, then triangle ABD and triangle ABC share the same base AB but have heights proportional to their distances from AB. Wait, but AD is parallel to BC, so maybe ABCD is a trapezoid? But D is on the line through A parallel to BC, which might not be the same line as BC unless ABC is a parallelogram, which it isn't necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is parallel to BC, the length AD can be related to BC via similar triangles? Maybe not directly.\n\nGiven that angle CMD is 90°, perhaps there is a circle with diameter CD passing through M? Wait, but angle CMD is 90°, so M lies on the circle with diameter CD. So the circle with diameter CD must pass through M.\n\nBut how does that help? Maybe construct that circle and find relations.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinate geometry as above. Maybe express all variables in terms of coordinates and show AB·CD - 2S ≥0.\n\nBut in the example, AB·CD = 2* (sqrt(260)/9) ≈ 3.58, and 2S≈1.78, so 3.58-1.78≈1.8>0. But need a general proof.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, AB·CD is exactly twice the area. Let me check calculations again.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system:\n\nAB is from (0,0) to (2,0), so length AB=2.\n\nCD is from (0,2) to (-2/9, 2/9). So displacement is (-2/9 -0, 2/9 -2) = (-2/9, -16/9). So length CD is sqrt( ( -2/9)^2 + (-16/9)^2 )= sqrt(4/81 +256/81)=sqrt(260/81)=sqrt(260)/9≈16.1245/9≈1.7916.\n\nSo AB·CD≈2*1.7916≈3.583.\n\nArea S=8/9≈0.8889, so 2S≈1.7778. Indeed, 3.583>1.7778.\n\nSo the inequality holds. But how to generalize?\n\nAlternatively, express AB·CD -2S as a non-negative quantity. Let's see.\n\nIn coordinate terms:\n\nAB is vector B - A.\n\nCD is vector D - C.\n\nBut AB·CD in coordinate terms is |AB| * |CD|. Wait, no, in the problem, it's AB multiplied by CD as lengths, not dot product. So the product of lengths AB and CD.\n\nThe area S is the area of quadrilateral AMCD. In coordinate terms, computed as 8/9 in the example. Then 2S=16/9≈1.78, while AB·CD≈3.58.\n\nBut how to relate AB·CD and 2S in general. Perhaps use coordinate expressions.\n\nLet me define coordinates generally. Let me place point A at (0,0), B at (b,0), and C at (0,c), making a right triangle for simplicity. Then centroid M is at ((b+0+0)/3, (0+0+c)/3)=(b/3, c/3).\n\nLine through A parallel to BC: BC is from (b,0) to (0,c), so slope is (c -0)/(0 -b)= -c/b. So line through A(0,0) with slope -c/b is y = (-c/b)x.\n\nParametrizing point D on this line: let D be (t, -c/b t) for some t.\n\nAngle CMD=90°, so vectors CM and DM are perpendicular.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nC is (0,c), M is (b/3, c/3), D is (t, -c/b t).\n\nVector CM = M - C = (b/3 -0, c/3 -c) = (b/3, -2c/3)\n\nVector DM = M - D = (b/3 - t, c/3 - (-c/b t)) = (b/3 - t, c/3 + c t /b)\n\nDot product of CM and DM must be zero:\n\n(b/3)(b/3 - t) + (-2c/3)(c/3 + c t /b) =0\n\nCompute term1: (b/3)(b/3 - t) = b²/9 - (b t)/3\n\nterm2: (-2c/3)(c/3 + c t /b) = (-2c²/9) - (2c² t)/(3b)\n\nTotal:\n\nb²/9 - (b t)/3 -2c²/9 - (2c² t)/(3b) =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 9b to eliminate denominators:\n\nb² * b - 3b * b t - 2c² b -6c² t =0\n\nWait, let's redo the multiplication:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n(b²/9) - (b t)/3 - (2c²)/9 - (2c² t)/(3b) =0\n\nMultiply by 9b:\n\nb² * b - 3b * b t - 2c² * b -6c² t =0\n\nSo:\n\nb³ - 3b² t - 2b c² -6c² t=0\n\nFactor terms with t:\n\nb³ -2b c² - t(3b² +6c²)=0\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt(3b² +6c²) = b³ -2b c²\n\nt= [b³ -2b c²]/(3b² +6c²) = [b(b² -2c²)]/[3b² +6c²)] = [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)] = [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nSo t= [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nHmm, interesting. So D has coordinates (t, -c/b t) where t is as above.\n\nNow compute S, the area of quadrilateral AMCD.\n\nCoordinates of points:\n\nA(0,0), M(b/3, c/3), C(0,c), D(t, -c/b t)\n\nUsing shoelace formula for quadrilateral AMCD.\n\nList the coordinates in order:\n\nA(0,0)\n\nM(b/3, c/3)\n\nC(0,c)\n\nD(t, -c/b t)\n\nBack to A(0,0)\n\nCompute Sum1:\n\nx_i * y_{i+1}:\n\n0*(c/3) + (b/3)*c +0*(-c/b t) + t*0 =0 + (b c)/3 +0 +0= b c /3\n\nSum2:\n\ny_i * x_{i+1}:\n\n0*(b/3) + (c/3)*0 +c*t + (-c/b t)*0 =0 +0 +c t +0= c t\n\nArea S= |Sum1 - Sum2| /2 = |b c /3 -c t| /2= |c(b/3 - t)| /2\n\nSo S= |c(b/3 - t)| /2\n\nGiven that t= [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nSo b/3 -t= b/3 - [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)] = [b(b² +2c²) -b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nExpand numerator:\n\nb(b² +2c²) -b(b² -2c²)= b^3 +2b c² -b^3 +2b c²=4b c²\n\nThus, b/3 -t=4b c²/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nTherefore, S= |c*(4b c²)/(3(b² +2c²))| /2= (4b c³)/(3(b² +2c²)) /2= (2b c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nHence, 2S= (4b c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nNow compute AB·CD.\n\nAB is length from A(0,0) to B(b,0): AB= b\n\nCD is length from C(0,c) to D(t, -c/b t). Compute distance:\n\nCD= sqrt[(t -0)^2 + (-c/b t -c)^2] = sqrt[t² + (-c t/b -c)^2]\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\n-c t/b -c= -c(t/b +1)\n\nSo squared: c²(t/b +1)^2= c²(t²/b² +2t/b +1)\n\nThus CD= sqrt[t² +c²(t²/b² +2t/b +1)]= sqrt[t² + c² t² /b² +2c² t /b +c²]\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsqrt[ t²(1 + c² /b²) +2c² t /b +c² ]\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe express in terms of t.\n\nGiven t= [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nLet's compute CD squared:\n\nt² +c²(t/b +1)^2= t² +c²(t²/b² +2t/b +1)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nt²= [b²(b² -2c²)^2]/[9(b² +2c²)^2]\n\nc²(t²/b² +2t/b +1)=c²[ [b²(b² -2c²)^2]/[9b²(b² +2c²)^2] + 2[b(b² -2c²)]/[3b(b² +2c²)] +1 ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term inside c²: [ (b² -2c²)^2 ]/[9(b² +2c²)^2 ]\n\nSecond term: 2[ (b² -2c²) ]/[3(b² +2c²) ]\n\nThird term:1\n\nSo:\n\nc²[ ( (b² -2c²)^2 )/(9(b² +2c²)^2 ) + 2(b² -2c²)/(3(b² +2c²)) +1 ]\n\nLet me denote x= b² -2c² and y= b² +2c². Then expression becomes:\n\nc²[ x²/(9y²) + 2x/(3y) +1 ]\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= c²[ x² + 6x y +9y² ]/(9y²)\n\n= c²[ (x +3y)^2 ]/(9y²)\n\nBut x= b² -2c², y= b² +2c². Then x +3y= (b² -2c²)+3(b² +2c²)=b² -2c² +3b² +6c²=4b² +4c²=4(b² +c²)\n\nSo CD squared= t² +c²(...) becomes:\n\nt² + c²*(16(b² +c²)^2)/(9y²)\n\nWait, let's redo:\n\nCD squared= t² + c²[ (x +3y)^2 ]/(9y² )\n\nBut x= b² -2c², y= b² +2c², so:\n\n= t² + c²*(4(b² +c²))^2/(9y²)\n\n= t² + c²*16(b² +c²)^2 /[9(b² +2c²)^2]\n\nBut t= [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]= b x /(3 y)\n\nSo t²= b² x² / (9 y²)\n\nThus CD squared= [b² x² +16c² (b² +c²)^2 ]/(9 y² )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, express AB·CD -2S and show it's non-negative.\n\nAB·CD= b * CD\n\n2S= (4b c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nSo need to show:\n\nb * CD ≥ (4b c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nDivide both sides by b (assuming b>0, which it is since AB is a length):\n\nCD ≥ (4c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nBut CD is sqrt[t² +c²(t/b +1)^2], which is complicated. Maybe in terms of x and y?\n\nAlternatively, use the expression for CD squared.\n\nWait, let's substitute the t into CD.\n\nFrom earlier, CD squared:\n\nt² +c²(t/b +1)^2\n\nt= [b(b² -2c²)]/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nSo t/b= (b² -2c²)/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nThus t/b +1= [b² -2c² +3b² +6c²]/[3(b² +2c²)]= [4b² +4c²]/[3(b² +2c²)]=4(b² +c²)/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nSo c²(t/b +1)^2= c²*(16(b² +c²)^2)/(9(b² +2c²)^2)\n\nThus CD squared= t² + 16c²(b² +c²)^2/(9(b² +2c²)^2)\n\nBut t squared= [b²(b² -2c²)^2]/[9(b² +2c²)^2]\n\nSo CD squared= [b²(b² -2c²)^2 +16c²(b² +c²)^2]/[9(b² +2c²)^2]\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nN= b²(b² -2c²)^2 +16c²(b² +c²)^2\n\nExpand both terms:\n\nFirst term: b²(b^4 -4b² c² +4c^4)=b^6 -4b^4 c² +4b² c^4\n\nSecond term:16c²(b^4 +2b² c² +c^4)=16c² b^4 +32b² c^4 +16c^6\n\nSum N= b^6 -4b^4 c² +4b² c^4 +16b^4 c² +32b² c^4 +16c^6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nb^6 + (-4b^4 c² +16b^4 c²) + (4b² c^4 +32b² c^4) +16c^6\n\n= b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6\n\nNotice that this factors as:\n\n= (b^2 +6c^2)^2 * (b^2 + (16c^6)/(...))? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nb^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6\n\nLet me check if it's a perfect square:\n\nSuppose it is (b^3 + pb^2 c + qb c^2 + r c^3)^2, but this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, factor as (b^2 + k c^2)^3 or similar. Wait, b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me write it as (b^2)^3 + 12(b^2)^2 c^2 + 36b^2 c^4 +16c^6.\n\nHmm, maybe (b^2 + 4c^2)^3?\n\nExpand (b^2 +4c^2)^3= b^6 +12b^4 c^2 +48b^2 c^4 +64c^6. No, coefficients don't match.\n\nAlternatively, (b^2 + 2c^2)^3= b^6 +6b^4 c^2 +12b^2 c^4 +8c^6. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe grouping terms:\n\nb^6 +12b^4 c^2 +36b^2 c^4 +16c^6= (b^6 +12b^4 c^2 +36b^2 c^4) +16c^6= b^2(b^4 +12b^2 c^2 +36c^4) +16c^6= b^2(b^2 +6c^2)^2 +16c^6. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, see if it factors:\n\nLet me try to factor N= b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6.\n\nLet me set x= b², y= c². Then N= x^3 +12x^2 y +36x y^2 +16y^3.\n\nFactor this cubic in x:\n\nx^3 +12x^2 y +36x y^2 +16y^3.\n\nTry to see if it's a perfect cube: (x + a y)^3= x^3 +3a x^2 y +3a² x y^2 +a³ y^3. Compare coefficients:\n\n3a=12 => a=4\n\nThen 3a²= 3*16=48, but in our case coefficient is 36. So not a perfect cube.\n\nAlternatively, factor by grouping:\n\nx^3 +12x^2 y +36x y^2 +16y^3= x^3 +12x^2 y + (36x y^2 +16y^3)\n\n= x²(x +12y) + y²(36x +16y). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for rational roots. If we consider N as a polynomial in x, for a specific y. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to move back to the original problem.\n\nWe need to show that AB·CD ≥2S, which in terms of variables is:\n\nb * CD ≥ (4b c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nDivide both sides by b (b>0):\n\nCD ≥ (4c³)/(3(b² +2c²))\n\nBut CD squared is:\n\nN/[9(b² +2c²)^2], where N= b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6.\n\nSo CD= sqrt(N)/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nThus, the inequality becomes:\n\nsqrt(N)/[3(b² +2c²)] ≥4c³/[3(b² +2c²)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3(b² +2c²):\n\nsqrt(N) ≥4c³\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nN ≥16c^6\n\nCheck if N -16c^6 ≥0\n\nN= b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4 +16c^6 -16c^6= b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4.\n\nThis is b^6 +12b^4 c² +36b² c^4= b²(b^4 +12b² c² +36c^4)= b²(b^2 +6c^2)^2.\n\nWhich is clearly non-negative. So sqrt(N)=sqrt(b²(b^2 +6c^2)^2)=b(b^2 +6c^2).\n\nThus, sqrt(N)=b(b² +6c²)\n\nThus, the left side of the inequality sqrt(N) ≥4c³ becomes:\n\nb(b² +6c²) ≥4c³\n\nOr:\n\nb(b² +6c²) -4c³ ≥0\n\nFactor:\n\nb^3 +6b c² -4c³\n\nWe need to show that this is non-negative.\n\nLet me consider this as a cubic in b: f(b)=b^3 +6b c² -4c³.\n\nCan we show that f(b) ≥0 for all positive b and c?\n\nAlternatively, for the original problem, since ABC is a triangle with centroid M and D constructed as specified, perhaps there are some constraints on the relationship between b and c.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, we set A at (0,0), B at (b,0), C at (0,c). But in reality, the triangle ABC can be any triangle, but we've chosen coordinates where A is at the origin, B on the x-axis, and C on the y-axis. This is a right triangle, but the original problem doesn't specify that ABC is a right triangle. So this might be a special case. Therefore, perhaps the assumption of right triangle is not valid for the general case. Therefore, my coordinate system might be too restrictive.\n\nTherefore, perhaps this approach is not general enough. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, use vectors. Let me place point A at the origin. Let vector AB = **b**, vector AC = **c**. Then centroid M is at ( **b** + **c** ) /3.\n\nThe line through A parallel to BC: BC is vector **c** - **b**, so the line through A (origin) in direction **c** - **b**. So any point D on this line can be expressed as t(**c** - **b**), where t is a scalar.\n\nGiven that angle CMD=90°, so (M - C) · (D - M)=0.\n\nExpressed in vectors:\n\nVector CM= M - C= ( (**b** + **c** )/3 - **c** )= ( **b** - 2**c** )/3\n\nVector DM= M - D= ( (**b** + **c** )/3 - t(**c** - **b** )\n\n= ( **b** + **c** )/3 - t**c** + t**b**\n\n= ( (1/3 + t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** )\n\nDot product of CM and DM must be zero:\n\n[( **b** - 2**c** )/3] · [ (1/3 + t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** ]=0\n\nAssume **b** and **c** are vectors, so their dot products are:\n\n(**b** · **b**) = |b|², (**b** · **c**)=**b**·**c**, (**c** · **c**)=|c|².\n\nExpand the dot product:\n\n[(1/3 + t)/3 |b|² + ( (1/3 -t)/3 - 2(1/3 + t)/3 ) **b**·**c** - 2(1/3 -t)/3 |c|² ]=0\n\nWait, this might be getting too complex. Alternatively, compute each component:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nVector CM= ( **b** -2**c** )/3\n\nVector DM= ( (1/3 + t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** )\n\nDot product:\n\n[ ( **b** -2**c** )/3 ] · [ (1/3 + t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** ]\n\n= (1/3)(1/3 + t)|**b**|² + (1/3)(1/3 -t)**b**·**c** - (2/3)(1/3 + t)**c**·**b** - (2/3)(1/3 -t)|**c**|²\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= ( (1/3)(1/3 + t) )|b|² + [ (1/3)(1/3 -t) - (2/3)(1/3 + t) ] **b**·**c** - (2/3)(1/3 -t)|c|²\n\nSimplify the coefficient of **b**·**c**:\n\n= [ (1/9 - t/3) - (2/9 + 2t/3) ] = (1/9 -2/9) + (-t/3 -2t/3)= (-1/9) -t\n\nCoefficient of |b|²: (1/9 + t/3)\n\nCoefficient of |c|²: -2/3(1/3 -t)= -2/9 +2t/3\n\nThus, equation:\n\n(1/9 + t/3)|b|² + (-1/9 -t)**b**·**c** + (-2/9 +2t/3)|c|²=0\n\nMultiply through by 9 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 +3t)|b|² + (-1 -9t)**b**·**c** + (-2 +6t)|c|²=0\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n(1 +3t)|b|² - (1 +9t)**b**·**c** + (-2 +6t)|c|²=0\n\nThis is a linear equation in t:\n\n[3|b|² -9**b**·**c** +6|c|²]t + [|b|² -**b**·**c** -2|c|²]=0\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt= [ - (|b|² -**b**·**c** -2|c|²) ] / [3|b|² -9**b**·**c** +6|c|² ]\n\n= [ -|b|² +**b**·**c** +2|c|² ] / [3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) ]\n\nThis expression for t seems complicated. Perhaps substitute specific values to check.\n\nIf we take the previous example where ABC is a right triangle with **b**=(2,0), **c**=(0,2), then |b|²=4, **b**·**c**=0, |c|²=4.\n\nThen t= [ -4 +0 +8 ] / [3(4 -0 +8) ]=4/(3*12)=4/36=1/9\n\nWait, but earlier in the coordinate example, t was -2/9. Hmm, discrepancy. Wait, in the coordinate system, vector D is t(**c** - **b**). In the previous example, **c** - **b**= (0,2)-(2,0)=(-2,2). So D= t*(-2,2). When t=1/9, D= (-2/9, 2/9), which matches our previous result of t=-2/9? Wait, no, because in the vector approach, D is t(**c** - **b**), so if t=1/9, D=( -2/9, 2/9). But in the coordinate example, we found t= -2/9. Wait, but no, in the vector approach, the parameter t is different. In the coordinate example, we parametrized D as (t, -t) on y=-x line. But in the vector approach, D is t(**c** - **b**)=t(-2,2). So to get the same point (-2/9,2/9), t=1/9. Hence, in the vector approach, t=1/9.\n\nBut according to the formula above, with |b|²=4, **b**·**c**=0, |c|²=4, we have t= ( -4 +0 +8 ) / [3(4 -0 +8) ]=4/(36)=1/9. Correct. So that's consistent. Then why in the coordinate example earlier, when solving for t, we got t= -2/9? Because in the coordinate example, we parametrized D as (t, -t), which is equivalent to D= t*(1, -1). But the line through A parallel to BC in that example had slope -1, which corresponds to direction vector (1, -1). However, the vector from B to C is (-2,2), which is direction vector (-2,2)= -2*(1,-1). So the direction vectors are scalar multiples. Hence, parametrizing with t in one case vs. t in the other case can differ by a scalar factor. In the coordinate example, the line was parametrized as (t, -t), while in the vector approach, it's t*(-2,2). Hence, t in vector approach is related to t in coordinate example by a factor of -2. So t in vector approach=1/9 corresponds to t_coord= -2/9, which matches the previous result. Therefore, the formulas are consistent.\n\nNow, returning to the general case, we have to express AB·CD and 2S in terms of vectors and show the inequality.\n\nAB is the length |**b**|.\n\nCD is the length from C to D. Since D= t(**c** - **b**), vector CD= D - C= t(**c** - **b**) - **c**= -**c** +t**c** -t**b**= (t-1)**c** -t**b**\n\nThus, CD= sqrt[ |(t-1)**c** -t**b**|² ]\n\n= sqrt[ (t-1)^2 |c|² + t^2 |b|² - 2t(t-1)**b**·**c** ]\n\nSimilarly, the area S of quadrilateral AMCD can be computed using vectors. But this seems complicated. Maybe instead use the area formula from before, but adjusted for vectors.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in the coordinate example, S was found to be |c(b/3 - t)| /2. Translating to vector terms, perhaps S= | **AC** · ( **M** - **D** ) | /2 ?\n\nBut need to think carefully. The area of quadrilateral AMCD can be decomposed into two triangles: AMC and ACD? Or AMC and MCD?\n\nWait, quadrilateral AMCD is A-M-C-D-A. So it's a quadrilateral that can be divided into triangles AMC and MCD. Let's compute the areas of these two triangles.\n\nArea of AMC: since M is the centroid, area is 1/3 of the area of ABC. But area of ABC is (1/2)|**b** × **c**|. So area of AMC= (1/2)(1/3)|**b** × **c**|= (1/6)|**b** × **c**|.\n\nArea of MCD: need to compute. Points M, C, D.\n\nVector CM= M - C= (**b** + **c**)/3 - **c**= (**b** -2**c**)/3\n\nVector CD= D - C= t(**c** - **b**) - **c**= -**c** +t**c** -t**b**= (t-1)**c** -t**b**\n\nThe area of triangle MCD is (1/2)|CM × CD|.\n\nCompute CM × CD= [(**b** -2**c**)/3] × [ (t-1)**c** -t**b** ]\n\n= (1/3)(**b** × [(t-1)**c** -t**b** ] -2**c** × [(t-1)**c** -t**b** ])\n\n= (1/3)[ (t-1)**b** × **c** -t**b** × **b** -2(t-1)**c** × **c** +2t**c** × **b** ]\n\nSince **b** × **b**=0 and **c** × **c**=0, this simplifies to:\n\n= (1/3)[ (t-1)**b** × **c** +2t**c** × **b** ]\n\n= (1/3)[ (t-1 -2t)**b** × **c** ]\n\n= (1/3)( -t -1 )**b** × **c**\n\nThus, the area of MCD is (1/2)| (1/3)(-t -1)**b** × **c** | = (1/6)|t +1||**b** × **c**|\n\nTherefore, total area S= area of AMC + area of MCD= (1/6)|**b** × **c**| + (1/6)|t +1||**b** × **c**|\n\nAssuming that the orientation is such that the areas add up, which depends on the position of D. In our coordinate example, when t=1/9, |t +1|=10/9, so S= (1/6 +10/54)|**b** × **c**|= (9/54 +10/54)|**b** × **c**|=19/54 |**b** × **c**|. But in the coordinate example, |**b** × **c**|= |(2,0) × (0,2)|=4, so S=19/54 *4=76/54=38/27≈1.407, but earlier calculation gave S=8/9≈0.888. Contradiction. So this approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, in the coordinate example, the shoelace formula gave S=8/9, but according to this vector approach, S=38/27. Which is different. So there must be a mistake in the decomposition.\n\nWait, the quadrilateral AMCD is not necessarily composed of triangles AMC and MCD. Depending on the position of D, the decomposition might be different. For instance, if D is on the line through A parallel to BC, in some positions, the quadrilateral might self-intersect. In our coordinate example, D is (-2/9,2/9), which is on the line y=-x through A. The points A(0,0), M(2/3,2/3), C(0,2), D(-2/9,2/9). When connecting these, the quadrilateral is A-M-C-D-A. Plotting these points, it should form a non-self-intersecting quadrilateral. The area calculated via shoelace was 8/9, but according to the vector decomposition, we get a different value. Therefore, my decomposition is wrong.\n\nAlternative decomposition: Perhaps AMCD is a quadrilateral composed of triangle AMD and trapezoid MDCC? Not sure. Alternatively, use the shoelace formula in vector terms.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the area of quadrilateral AMCD, and we have coordinates for all points in the vector approach, we can compute S using vectors.\n\nPoints:\n\nA: origin\n\nM: ( **b** + **c** )/3\n\nC: **c**\n\nD: t(**c** - **b**)\n\nThe shoelace formula in vectors requires the coordinates. Expressing in terms of **b** and **c**, but this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, use the determinant formula for area.\n\nThe area of quadrilateral AMCD can be computed as the sum of the areas of triangles AMC and ACD, plus the area of triangle ACD. Wait, no:\n\nPoints A, M, C, D.\n\nPossible decompositions:\n\n1. Split into triangles AMC and ACD. But this might not cover the entire quadrilateral.\n\n2. Split into triangles AMC, MCD, and AMD. But overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, use the shoelace formula in the general case.\n\nGiven the coordinates of the four points in order:\n\nA(0,0), M((b1 +c1)/3, (b2 +c2)/3), C(c1,c2), D(t(c1 -b1), t(c2 -b2))\n\nThe shoelace formula would give:\n\nS=1/2 |x1y2 +x2y3 +x3y4 +x4y1 - (y1x2 +y2x3 +y3x4 +y4x1)|\n\nSubstituting:\n\nx1=0, y1=0\n\nx2=(b1 +c1)/3, y2=(b2 +c2)/3\n\nx3=c1, y3=c2\n\nx4=t(c1 -b1), y4=t(c2 -b2)\n\nx4= t(c1 -b1), y4= t(c2 -b2)\n\nCompute Sum1= x1y2 +x2y3 +x3y4 +x4y1\n\n=0*( (b2 +c2)/3 ) + ( (b1 +c1)/3 )*c2 +c1*(t(c2 -b2)) + t(c1 -b1)*0\n\n= ( (b1 +c1)c2 )/3 + c1 t(c2 -b2)\n\nSum2= y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x1\n\n=0*((b1 +c1)/3 ) + ( (b2 +c2)/3 )*c1 +c2*(t(c1 -b1)) + t(c2 -b2)*0\n\n= ( (b2 +c2)c1 )/3 + c2 t(c1 -b1)\n\nThus, Area S=1/2 |Sum1 -Sum2|\n\n=1/2 | [ (b1 +c1)c2 /3 + c1 t(c2 -b2) ] - [ (b2 +c2)c1 /3 + c2 t(c1 -b1) ] |\n\nSimplify inside the absolute value:\n\n=1/2 | [ (b1 c2 +c1 c2)/3 + c1 t c2 -c1 t b2 ] - [ (b2 c1 +c2 c1)/3 +c2 t c1 -c2 t b1 ] |\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n=1/2 | [ b1 c2 /3 +c1 c2 /3 +c1 c2 t -c1 b2 t -b2 c1 /3 -c1 c2 /3 -c1 c2 t +c2 b1 t ] |\n\nNotice that many terms cancel:\n\nc1 c2 /3 -c1 c2 /3 =0\n\nc1 c2 t -c1 c2 t=0\n\nRemaining terms:\n\nb1 c2 /3 -c1 b2 /3 -c1 b2 t +c2 b1 t\n\n= (1/3)(b1 c2 -c1 b2) + t(b1 c2 -c1 b2 )\n\nFactor out (b1 c2 -c1 b2):\n\n= (b1 c2 -c1 b2)(1/3 + t)\n\nBut b1 c2 -c1 b2 is the determinant of vectors **b** and **c**, which is the area of the parallelogram formed by **b** and **c**, so twice the area of triangle ABC.\n\nThus, Area S=1/2 | (b1 c2 -c1 b2)(1/3 +t) | =1/2 | ( **b** × **c** )(1/3 +t) | = (1/2)| **b** × **c** | |1/3 +t|\n\nGiven that area is positive, we can drop the absolute value:\n\nS= (1/2)| **b** × **c** | |1/3 +t|\n\nBut in our coordinate example, **b**=(2,0), **c**=(0,2), so **b** × **c**=4. t=1/9 (vector approach) or t=-2/9 (coordinate parametrization). Wait, in vector approach, t=1/9 gives 1/3 +1/9=4/9. So S= (1/2)*4*(4/9)=8/9, which matches the shoelace result. Correct.\n\nThus, general formula for S= (1/2)|**b** × **c**| |1/3 +t|\n\nBut t is determined from the equation derived earlier:\n\nt= [ -|b|² +**b**·**c** +2|c|² ] / [3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) ]\n\nLet me denote numerator as N= -|b|² +**b**·**c** +2|c|²\n\nDenominator as D=3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²)\n\nThus, t= N/D\n\nThen 1/3 +t=1/3 + N/D= (D/3 +N)/D\n\nCompute D/3 +N= (|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) + (-|b|² +**b**·**c** +2|c|² )\n\n= (|b|² -|b|²) + (-3**b**·**c** +**b**·**c** ) + (2|c|² +2|c|² )\n\n=0 + (-2**b**·**c** ) +4|c|²\n\n=4|c|² -2**b**·**c**\n\nThus, 1/3 +t= (4|c|² -2**b**·**c**)/D\n\nBut D=3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²)\n\nThus,\n\nS= (1/2)|**b** × **c**| * | (4|c|² -2**b**·**c**)/D |\n\n= (1/2)|**b** × **c**| * | (4|c|² -2**b**·**c**)/[3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) ] |\n\nThus, 2S= |**b** × **c**| * | (4|c|² -2**b**·**c**)/[3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) ] |\n\nNow, AB·CD is |**b**| * |CD|\n\nWe need to show that |**b**| * |CD| ≥ |**b** × **c**| * | (4|c|² -2**b**·**c**)/[3(|b|² -3**b**·**c** +2|c|²) ] |\n\nThis seems quite involved. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me recall the user's approach: they expressed 2S=AC·MD·sinα, then since sinα ≤1, it suffices to show AB·CD ≥ AC·MD.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's try to follow this.\n\nGiven that 2S= AC·MD·sinα ≤ AC·MD, then to show AB·CD ≥ AC·MD.\n\nThus, the inequality reduces to AB·CD ≥ AC·MD.\n\nWhich is equivalent to (AB/AC) ≥ (MD/CD).\n\nIf we can show that (AB/AC)=(MD/CD), or that triangles involved are similar with this ratio, then equality holds. Or use some properties of centroids.\n\nAlternatively, express MD and CD in terms of the triangle.\n\nSince M is the centroid, MD is a segment from M to D. D is on the line through A parallel to BC.\n\nMaybe use coordinate system where A is origin, B is (1,0), C is (0,1). Then centroid M is (1/3,1/3). Line through A parallel to BC has slope -1, equation y=-x. Point D is (t,-t) for some t.\n\nAngle CMD=90°, so as before, find t.\n\nCompute vectors CM and DM.\n\nCM=M -C=(1/3 -0,1/3 -1)=(1/3,-2/3)\n\nDM=M -D=(1/3 -t,1/3 +t)\n\nDot product zero: (1/3)(1/3 -t) + (-2/3)(1/3 +t)=0\n\n(1/9 -t/3) + (-2/9 -2t/3)=0\n\nCombine terms: (1/9 -2/9) + (-t/3 -2t/3)= (-1/9) -t=0\n\nThus, -t=1/9 → t=-1/9. So D=(-1/9,1/9).\n\nCompute AB=1, AC=√2.\n\nCD is distance from C(0,1) to D(-1/9,1/9): sqrt( ( -1/9 -0)^2 + (1/9 -1)^2 )=sqrt(1/81 +64/81)=sqrt(65/81)=√65/9.\n\nMD is distance from M(1/3,1/3) to D(-1/9,1/9): sqrt( (1/3 +1/9)^2 + (1/3 -1/9)^2 )=sqrt( (4/9)^2 + (2/9)^2 )=sqrt(16/81 +4/81)=sqrt(20)/9=2√5/9.\n\nSo AB/AC=1/√2≈0.707.\n\nMD/CD= (2√5/9)/(√65/9)=2√5/√65=2√(5/65)=2/√13≈0.555.\n\nThus, 0.707≥0.555, so AB/AC≥MD/CD holds.\n\nHence, inequality holds in this case.\n\nBut how to prove it generally?\n\nPerhaps consider the ratio AB/AC and MD/CD.\n\nExpressed in terms of vectors:\n\nAB=|**b**|, AC=|**c**|, MD=|M -D|, CD=|D -C|.\n\nFrom earlier, in the vector approach, D= t(**c** - **b**).\n\nSo MD= |M -D|= |( **b** + **c** )/3 - t(**c** - **b** )|\n\n= | ( (1/3 +t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** ) |\n\nCD= |D -C|= | t(**c** - **b** ) - **c** |= | (t-1)**c** -t**b** |\n\nWe need to show that |**b**| / |**c**| ≥ | (1/3 +t)**b** + (1/3 -t)**c** | / | (t-1)**c** -t**b** |\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, note that in the coordinate example, this ratio holds due to the specific positions. Perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nLet me consider vectors:\n\nLet me denote **u**=**b**, **v**=**c**\n\nWe need to show that |**u**| / |**v**| ≥ | (1/3 +t)**u** + (1/3 -t)**v** | / | (t-1)**v** -t**u** |\n\nCross-multiplying (assuming |**v**|≠0 and denominator ≠0):\n\n|**u**| * | (t-1)**v** -t**u** | ≥ |**v**| * | (1/3 +t)**u** + (1/3 -t)**v** |\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate absolute values:\n\n|**u**|² * | (t-1)**v** -t**u** |² ≥ |**v**|² * | (1/3 +t)**u** + (1/3 -t)**v** |²\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n|**u**|² [ (t-1)² |**v**|² + t² |**u**|² - 2t(t-1)**u**·**v** ]\n\nRight side:\n\n|**v**|² [ (1/3 +t)² |**u**|² + (1/3 -t)² |**v**|² + 2(1/3 +t)(1/3 -t)**u**·**v** ]\n\nThis expansion is quite involved. Perhaps substituting the expression for t.\n\nRecall that t is derived from the condition that CM and DM are perpendicular. From earlier in the vector approach, t= [ -|u|² + **u**·**v** +2|v|² ] / [3(|u|² -3**u**·**v** +2|v|²) ]\n\nLet me denote this t as t= N/D where N= -|u|² + **u**·**v** +2|v|² and D=3(|u|² -3**u**·**v** +2|v|²)\n\nSubstituting this t into the inequality expression would make it extremely complex. Therefore, perhaps this approach is not tractable.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, maybe there's a synthetic geometry approach that the user missed.\n\nGoing back to the problem:\n\nGiven triangle ABC with centroid M, D on line through A parallel to BC such that angle CMD=90°. Prove AB·CD ≥2S, where S is area of AMCD.\n\nThe user reduced it to showing AB/AC ≥ MD/CD.\n\nPerhaps using triangle similarity or some proportionality.\n\nConsider triangle ABD and triangle MDC. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is parallel to BC, then the ratio of areas might relate to the ratio of their bases.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinate geometry but in a more general setting.\n\nAlternatively, since M is the centroid, consider properties of medians.\n\nAlternatively, use vectors and dot product.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the expression AB·CD ≥2S, the right side is twice the area, which often relates to the magnitude of a cross product. So perhaps AB·CD is related to the cross product of some vectors.\n\nIndeed, 2S= |**AM** × **AC** + **MC** × **MD**| or something similar, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the area of quadrilateral AMCD, which can be expressed as the sum of areas of triangles AMC and AMD. Wait, no:\n\nWait, AMCD is A-M-C-D-A. So it's a quadrilateral. If we decompose it into triangles AMC and ACD, then area S= area AMC + area ACD.\n\nArea AMC is 1/3 of area ABC, since M is centroid.\n\nArea ACD can be computed as 1/2 |**AC** × **AD**|.\n\nSince AD is parallel to BC, vector AD= k**BC**, where k is a scalar.\n\nGiven that AD is parallel to BC, then triangle ACD has base AC and height proportional to the distance between AD and BC.\n\nBut since D is on the line through A parallel to BC, the distance from D to BC is the same as the distance from A to BC. Wait, no, because the line through A parallel to BC is at a different height. The distance from A to BC is h, then the distance from D to BC would also be h, but since D is on the line through A parallel to BC, so the distance remains h. Thus, area of triangle ACD would be same as area of triangle ABC? Not necessarily, because the base might be different.\n\nWait, if AD is parallel to BC, then the area of triangle ACD is equal to the area of triangle ABC, since they have the same base BC and same height. But AD is parallel to BC, but ACD is a different triangle. Wait, no. The area of triangle ACD would depend on the length of AD and the height from C to AD.\n\nBut since AD is parallel to BC, the height from C to AD is the same as the height from B to AD. Hmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use mass point geometry or coordinate geometry.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the key i",
