    "Content": "Exercise 16.2 from Daniel Bump - Lie Groups . Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group and let $g\\in G$ . Show that\nthe centralizer $C_G(g)$ of $g$ is connected. I have some problems verifying this, I have tried to use that in that case the exponential map is surjective, and think of the maximal torus, but I have not achieved it, I would appreciate some answer.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Observe that $C(g)=C(<g>)$ i.e the centralizer of an element is the centralizer of the subgroup generated by it. Next observe that $C(H)=C(\\overline{H})$ for any subgroup of $H\\subset G$ . This means that the centralizer of $g$ is equal to the centralizer of $\\overline{<g>}$ . $\\overline{<g>}$ is a compact abelian subgroup of $G$ . If it's connected then its a torus. For a torus we have the follwing Theorem 16.6( Daniel Bump - Lie Groups.). Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group and $S \\subset G$ a torus\n  (not necessarily maximal). Then the centralizer $C_{G}(S)$ is a closed connected\n  Lie subgroup of $G$ . Every element of a compact connected lie group is contained in a maximal torus. And for a torus we have: Corollary 15.1( Daniel Bump - Lie Groups.). Each compact torus $T$ has a generator. Indeed, generators are dense in $T$ . This means that the assertion is true for a dense set in $G$ . In general I dont think its true. A counter example will need to be a an element with a discrete closure subgroup. There are no counter examples in the unitary group as elements commute if they have the same eigenspaces. We can diagonelize a matrix and degenerate it’s eagenvalues to 1 while preserving the eigenspaces. This means the assertion is true in the unitary group.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe problem is from an exercise in Daniel Bump's Lie Groups book. The task is to show that the centralizer of an element \\( g \\) in a compact connected Lie group \\( G \\) is connected. The user mentioned trying to use the exponential map's surjectivity and considering maximal tori but hasn't succeeded yet.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions from the problem statement:\n\n1. \\( G \\) is a compact connected Lie group.\n2. \\( g \\) is an element of \\( G \\).\n\nThese are the two main assumptions. The problem is to show that the centralizer \\( C_G(g) \\) of \\( g \\) is connected. \n\nWait, does the problem have any other implicit assumptions? The original problem doesn't mention anything else, like specific properties of \\( g \\) (e.g., being regular or semisimple), so we shouldn't add those. The key points are compactness, connectedness of \\( G \\), and \\( g \\) being an arbitrary element in \\( G \\).\n\nSo the assumptions are straightforward. Each is a separate line: one about \\( G \\), the other about \\( g \\).\n\nNow, structure the problem part. The problem is to prove that \\( C_G(g) \\) is connected. \n\nDouble-checking the original problem statement to ensure no other conditions are missed. The user's attempt mentions the exponential map and maximal tori, but those are part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't add more conditions beyond \\( G \\) being compact connected and \\( g \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nSo the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then state the problem to prove the centralizer is connected.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem states \"compact connected Lie group\" and \"g ∈ G\". No additional constraints. So the answer should list those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
