I know that you can find the eigenvalues by finding the $\\det(A-\\lambda \\cdot I)$, but it seems to me that the computation will be rather difficult to compute as it is a $4 \\times 4$ matrix. My question: is there an easier method to calculate the eigenvalues of $A$? \nAnd if I have to conclude that these are the only eigenvalues, is there a theorem that argues how many eigenvalues a matrix can have?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$A$ has zero row sums. Therefore the all-one vector $\\mathbf e$ is an eigenvector of $A$ for the eigenvalue $0$. Since $A$ is also real symmetric, $\\mathbf e$ can be extended to an orthogonal eigenbasis $\\{\\mathbf u,\\mathbf v,\\mathbf w,\\mathbf e\\}$ of $A$. But this is also an eigenbasis of $A+\\mathbf e\\mathbf e^\\top$. Hence the spectrum of $A$ is $\\{a,b,c,0\\}$ if and only if the spectrum of $A+\\mathbf e\\mathbf e^\\top$ is $\\{a,b,c,\\|\\mathbf e\\|^2\\}=\\{a,b,c,4\\}$. It is easy to see that four eigenvalues of\n$$\nA+\\mathbf e\\mathbf e^\\top=\\pmatrix{3&0&0&1\\\\ 0&4&0&0\\\\ 0&0&4&0\\\\ 1&0&0&3}\n$$\nare $2,4,4,4$. Therefore the eigenvalues of $A$ are $2,4,4,0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original question. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the matrix A is given as a 4x4 matrix with specific entries. The question asks to show that 0, 2, 4 are eigenvalues and that these are the only ones. The user mentions knowing that eigenvalues can be found via determinant calculation but finds it difficult for a 4x4 matrix. They also ask about an easier method and whether there's a theorem about the number of eigenvalues.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would include the specific entries of matrix A, since the problem is about this particular matrix. Also, the fact that the user wants to conclude 0,2,4 are the only eigenvalues implies that the matrix is 4x4, which has exactly 4 eigenvalues (counting multiplicities), but maybe that's a theorem point. However, the problem states that the eigenvalues are 0,2,4, which are three distinct values, but since it's a 4x4 matrix, perhaps one of them has multiplicity 2. Wait, the user says \"conclude that these are the only eigenvalues\", so the assumptions should include the matrix's size and structure.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that 0,2,4 are the eigenvalues for the matrix A\" and then \"conclude that these are the only eigenvalues\". The matrix is 4x4, so there should be four eigenvalues (with multiplicity). But the user lists three distinct values. This might imply that one of them is repeated. However, the problem states \"0,2,4 are the eigenvalues\", maybe meaning that each is an eigenvalue, but there could be a fourth. But the user wants to conclude that these are the only ones. So perhaps the matrix is symmetric (since it's given as a symmetric matrix), so it has real eigenvalues and is diagonalizable, hence the algebraic multiplicities sum to 4. If 0,2,4 are the only eigenvalues, then maybe one of them has multiplicity 2. For example, maybe 2 has multiplicity 2. But the problem as stated wants us to show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues and that they are the only ones. So the assumptions would include the matrix entries, the size (4x4), and perhaps the symmetry. But the user didn't explicitly mention symmetry, but looking at the matrix, rows 1 and 4 have similar structures, rows 2 and 3 as well. Let me check the matrix:\n\nA is:\nRow 1: 2, -1, -1, 0\nRow 2: -1, 3, -1, -1\nRow 3: -1, -1, 3, -1\nRow 4: 0, -1, -1, 2\n\nYes, the matrix is symmetric. So symmetry is an important property here. Symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and are diagonalizable, so the algebraic multiplicities sum to 4. Therefore, if we can show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues with multiplicities adding up to 4, then they are the only ones.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that A is a 4x4 matrix, that A is symmetric (since the problem might rely on properties of symmetric matrices), and the specific entries as given. But maybe the user didn't mention symmetry; however, the matrix is symmetric. So perhaps the assumption is the structure of the matrix. Each entry is given, so the assumption is the matrix A as defined.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a 4x4 matrix defined by the entries provided.\n- The entries of A are as specified (maybe list them? But in the example, they just mentioned the formula for A(n). Here, perhaps just refer to the given matrix A).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a 4×4 matrix with entries:\nRow 1: 2, -1, -1, 0,\nRow 2: -1, 3, -1, -1,\nRow 3: -1, -1, 3, -1,\nRow 4: 0, -1, -1, 2.\n\nAlternatively, since the matrix is given explicitly, maybe the assumption is just the matrix A as defined. But how to phrase each line as one property?\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the assumption for the first problem was \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Each line is a separate condition. Here, perhaps:\n\n- A is a 4×4 matrix.\n- The entries of A are as specified in the problem statement.\nBut the problem statement gives the matrix explicitly, so maybe the assumption is:\n\n- A is the matrix:\n$$\nA=\\pmatrix{\n2  &  -1 & -1 &  0  \\\\\n-1  & 3 &  -1 &  -1  \\\\\n-1  &  -1 &  3 & -1  \\\\\n0  &  -1 & -1 &  2  \\\\\n}\n$$\n\nBut the example structured the assumption as two lines, each addressing one property. Here, maybe:\n\n- A is a 4×4 matrix.\n- The entries of A are as specified in the matrix above.\n\nBut since the matrix is explicitly given, perhaps the entire matrix definition is one assumption. However, the example's first problem listed two separate assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Therefore, here, perhaps the first assumption is that A is a 4x4 matrix, and the second is the specific entries. But in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer (which is given in the problem statement) and another that n is divisible by 7 (which might not have been stated but was part of the formatted problem). Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe that example is not directly applicable here. Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption should not add \"n is divisible by 7\" unless there was a misformatting. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their format.\n\nIn any case, the task is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. For the current problem, the main assumptions are that A is the given 4x4 matrix, and possibly that A is symmetric, but since the matrix is symmetric, maybe that's inherent. However, the problem might not state that A is symmetric, but it's visible in the matrix. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 4×4 matrix.\n- The entries of A are as specified in the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem statement gives the entries explicitly. Alternatively, each row could be an assumption, but that's probably not necessary. Alternatively, the matrix is symmetric, which is an important property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a symmetric 4×4 matrix.\n- The entries of A are as specified in the matrix above.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly mention that A is symmetric; it's just given as a matrix. So maybe the first assumption is the matrix A as defined, which happens to be symmetric. However, for the purposes of the problem, the symmetry is important because symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, which might help in finding eigenvalues without computing the characteristic polynomial. But perhaps the user is supposed to notice that the matrix is symmetric, so that's an assumption. But since the problem didn't state it, but the matrix is symmetric, perhaps it's an inherent property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is the given 4×4 matrix with entries as specified.\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n\nBut again, the problem didn't state that A is symmetric; it's just that the given matrix is symmetric. So maybe the first assumption is the matrix definition, and the symmetry is a derived property, not an assumption. Hmm. The problem might not require assuming symmetry; perhaps the user is supposed to use the structure of the matrix. For instance, the matrix might have a certain pattern, like being a Laplacian matrix of a graph or having a block structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is a graph Laplacian. Looking at the matrix, the diagonal entries are degrees, and the off-diagonal are -1 for adjacent nodes. For example, in a graph Laplacian, each diagonal entry is the degree of the node, and the off-diagonal entries are -1 if nodes are connected. Let's see: Row 1 has diagonal entry 2, which would mean node 1 has degree 2. The off-diagonal entries are -1, -1, 0, so connected to nodes 2 and 3, but not node 4. Similarly, node 4 has diagonal entry 2, connected to nodes 2 and 3. Nodes 2 and 3 have degree 3, connected to nodes 1,3,4 (for node 2) and nodes 1,2,4 (for node 3). So the graph would have edges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4. That's a complete graph minus the edge between 1-4. But maybe that's a stretch. Alternatively, it's a weighted graph. Anyway, maybe the structure helps in finding eigenvalues.\n\nBut regardless, the problem is to show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues and that they're the only ones. The user also asks about an easier method than computing the determinant and about the theorem regarding the number of eigenvalues.\n\nSo, to structure the problem, the assumptions should include the specific matrix given, perhaps noting its symmetry if that's considered an assumption, but since the problem just presents the matrix, perhaps the main assumption is the matrix's definition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a 4×4 matrix with entries as specified in the problem.\n- The eigenvalues to verify are 0, 2, and 4.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that these are eigenvalues and that they are the only ones. The example had assumptions listed as given conditions. In this case, the main assumption is the matrix A as defined. The eigenvalues 0,2,4 are what need to be proven, not assumptions. So the assumptions are only about the given conditions of the problem, not the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions here would be:\n\n- A is a 4×4 matrix as defined in the problem.\n- The problem requires showing that 0, 2, and 4 are eigenvalues of A.\n- The problem also requires concluding that these are the only eigenvalues of A.\n\nBut no, assumptions are the given conditions. The problem is to show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues and that they're the only ones. So the only assumption is the matrix A is as given. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is the 4×4 matrix defined by:\n$$\nA=\\pmatrix{\n2  &  -1 & -1 &  0  \\\\\n-1  & 3 &  -1 &  -1  \\\\\n-1  &  -1 &  3 & -1  \\\\\n0  &  -1 & -1 &  2  \\\\\n}\n$$\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was split into two lines: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, since the matrix is given as a single entity, maybe the entire matrix is one assumption. However, the user's example split into separate lines for each property. Alternatively, since the matrix is a single object with multiple properties, perhaps it's acceptable to have one line for the matrix definition.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have more assumptions, like the matrix is symmetric, but since that's inherent in the given entries, maybe it's not an assumption but a derived property. However, in terms of assumptions from the problem statement, the only thing given is the matrix A. So the assumption should be the matrix A as defined.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is the 4×4 matrix:\n$$\nA=\\pmatrix{\n2  &  -1 & -1 &  0  \\\\\n-1  & 3 &  -1 &  -1  \\\\\n-1  &  -1 &  3 & -1  \\\\\n0  &  -1 & -1 &  2  \\\\\n}\n$$\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0, 2, and 4 are eigenvalues of A and conclude that these are the only eigenvalues of A.\n\nAdditionally, the original question asks for an easier method than computing the determinant and about the theorem on the number of eigenvalues. However, the problem part should capture the main task. The additional questions might be part of the user's query but need to be structured into the problem statement.\n\nBut the user's original problem statement is: \"Show that 0,2,4 are the eigenvalues for the matrix A [...] and conclude that 0,2,4 are the only eigenvalues for A. [...] is there an easier method to calculate the eigenvalues of A? And [...] is there a theorem that argues how many eigenvalues a matrix can have?\"\n\nBut according to the format, the Problem part should be the problem to solve. The additional questions about easier methods and theorems might be part of the user's query but not part of the problem statement. The example included only the problem to solve, not the auxiliary questions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should include only the main problem, which is to show the eigenvalues and conclude they're the only ones. The questions about easier methods and theorems are part of the user's inquiry but perhaps not part of the formatted problem. However, the user might want to include them. Wait, the example formatted problem includes the problem as stated, so maybe we should include the entire problem as stated, filtered of unrelated info.\n\nOriginal problem: The user wants to show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues and conclude they're the only ones, and asks about an easier method and the theorem. But the formatted problem should be the problem statement, not the questions about methods or theorems. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0, 2, and 4 are eigenvalues of the matrix A, and conclude that these are the only eigenvalues of A.\n\nThen, the additional questions about easier methods and theorems are part of the user's inquiry but might not be included in the formatted problem. However, the original example included the problem as \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps in this case, the problem part is the main task, and the questions about easier methods are additional but not part of the formatted problem. So the formatted problem would be as above.\n\nBut the user's example included the original problem's math expression directly. So in this case, the problem is to show that 0,2,4 are eigenvalues and that they're the only ones. Therefore, the formatted problem should include that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is the 4×4 matrix:\n$$\nA=\\pmatrix{\n2  &  -1 & -1 &  0  \\\\\n-1  & 3 &  -1 &  -1  \\\\\n-1  &  -1 &  3 & -1  \\\\\n0  &  -1 & -1 &  2  \\\\\n}\n$$\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0, 2, and 4 are eigenvalues of A and conclude that these are the only eigenvalues of A.\n\nThis seems correct. The assumption is the matrix definition, and the problem is to show the eigenvalues and their exclusivity. The user's additional questions about easier methods and theorems are part of their inquiry but not part of the formatted problem as per the example provided.",
