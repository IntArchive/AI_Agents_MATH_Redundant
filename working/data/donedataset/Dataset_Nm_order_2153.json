    "Content": "How can we simplify $\\cos^6x+\\sin^6x$ to $1−3\\sin^2x\\cos^2x$ ? One reasonable approach seems to be using $\\left(\\cos^2x+\\sin^2x\\right)^3=1$ , since it contains the terms $\\cos^6x$ and $\\sin^6x$ . Another possibility would be replacing all occurrences of $\\sin^2x$ by $1-\\cos^2x$ on both sides and then comparing the results. Are there other solutions, simpler approaches? I found some other questions about the same expression, but they simplify this to another form: Finding $\\sin^6 x+\\cos^6 x$, what am I doing wrong here? , Alternative proof of $\\cos^6{\\theta}+\\sin^6{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{8}(5+3\\cos{4\\theta})$ and Simplify $2(\\sin^6x + \\cos^6x) - 3(\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x) + 1$ . Perhaps also Prove that $\\sin^{6}{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}+\\cos^{6}{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\frac{1}{4}(1+3\\cos^2\\theta)$ can be considered similar. The expression $\\cos^6x+\\sin^6x$ also appears in this integral Find $ \\int \\frac {\\tan 2x} {\\sqrt {\\cos^6x +\\sin^6x}} dx $ but again it is transformed to a different from then required here. Note: The main reason for posting this is that this question was deleted, but I still think that the answers there might be useful for people learning trigonometry. Hopefully this new question would not be closed for lack of context. And the answers from the deleted question could be moved here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well, it's very easy if you know some basic formulas from algebra. $a^3+b^3$ $=(a+b)(a^2+b^2−ab)$ $=(a+b)((a+b)^2−2ab−ab)$ $=(a+b)^\n3−3ab(a+b)$ Now substitute $a$ and $b$ as $a=\\sin^2x,\\;b=\\cos^2x$ and use the identity $\\sin^2x+\\cos^2x=1$ You will get your answer which is $\\sin^6x+\\cos^6x=1−3\\sin^2x\\cos^2x$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave shows breaking down assumptions into single-line points and then stating the problem. \n\nThe original problem here is about proving that cos^6x + sin^6x equals 1 - 3 sin²x cos²x. The user on MSE mentioned using the identity (cos²x + sin²x)^3 = 1, which expands to include the sixth powers. Another approach they considered is substituting sin²x with 1 - cos²x. They also referenced other related questions, but the main task is simplifying the expression to the given form.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about trigonometric identities. The key elements here are that we're dealing with cosine and sine functions raised to the sixth power, and the goal is to simplify their sum. \n\nAssumptions would include that x is a real number (since trigonometric functions typically take real arguments unless specified otherwise), and that standard trigonometric identities like cos²x + sin²x = 1 apply. However, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this trigonometric problem, maybe the assumptions are that x is a real number, and the use of the Pythagorean identity. But the problem itself doesn't state any restrictions on x; it's a general identity. So perhaps the main assumption is that x is a real variable for which the trigonometric functions are defined, which is always true unless otherwise specified. However, the example included specific conditions, but here there's no such. Maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the variables involved. But the user's format requires listing assumptions line by line. If there are no explicit assumptions, perhaps I need to infer implicit ones. For instance, that x is a real number, and that standard trigonometric identities hold. But each assumption must be a single line. \n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption listed n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the user's formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but the instruction here is to filter unrelated information. The user wants us to extract the problem and list the assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have assumptions that are in the problem. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check. Original example: Original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91\". Then formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't have \"n is divisible by 7\". That's conflicting. So perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, the user wants us to follow their format. \n\nIn the current problem, the question is to show that cos^6x + sin^6x equals 1 - 3 sin²x cos²x. The assumptions here would be about the trigonometric identities applicable. Since the problem is to prove an identity, perhaps the key assumption is that x is a real number (as trigonometric identities hold for real numbers), and that the Pythagorean identity holds (cos²x + sin²x = 1). But each assumption should be a single line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\ncos²x + sin²x = 1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the identity to be proven is an algebraic manipulation, so maybe the main assumption is just that x is a real number, and the rest are standard identities that can be used. However, the user's example had specific conditions applied to the variable. Since the problem here is general, perhaps the only assumption is that x is a real number. But maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumption beyond the variables being real. However, the user's example included an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems incorrect, but maybe the user intended to highlight specific conditions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it? For example, maybe the original problem actually required n divisible by 7, but the user's example made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to list all possible assumptions from the problem. \n\nIn any case, the current problem is about proving an identity. The key assumptions here would be that x is a real number (since trigonometric functions are typically defined for real numbers in this context), and that standard trigonometric identities apply. However, since the problem is purely algebraic/trigonometric manipulation, perhaps the only explicit assumption is that x is a real number. The other identities like cos²x + sin²x =1 are part of the problem-solving steps, not assumptions of the problem. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as x being a real number, and the problem is to show the given identity. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which suggests that the divisibility by 7 is part of the problem's conclusion. That seems like a mistake in the example. However, following the user's instruction, we need to filter the problem and list the assumptions. So for the trigonometric identity problem, the only assumption is that x is a real number. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\cos^6x + \\sin^6x = 1 - 3\\sin^2x \\cos^2x$.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user also mentioned replacing sin²x by 1 - cos²x. That suggests that the Pythagorean identity is a tool to be used, but it's a standard identity, not an assumption of the problem. So perhaps the only assumption is x being real. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that x is such that all expressions are defined (but for sin and cos, that's all real numbers). So I think that's the main assumption here. The example might have included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but following the user's example, perhaps we need to extract the key assumptions. Since the original problem is a trigonometric identity, the key assumption is x is a real number. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
