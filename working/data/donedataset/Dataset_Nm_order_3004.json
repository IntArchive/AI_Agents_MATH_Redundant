    "Content": "There is a question (2.4.c) marked ** (to denote \"extremely difficult/currently open problem\") in Silverman and Tate's Rational Points on Elliptic Curves which I found really interesting and wondered if anyone can shed any more light on the problem for me. Let $p\\geq 5$ be a prime and let $C=C_p: y^2  = x^3 + 1$ be the cubic curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Let $M_p = \\left\\vert C(\\mathbb{F}_p)\\right\\vert$ be the order of the group of rational points of $C$ (this includes the point at infinity). Looking at some small primes I proved that if $p\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ then $M_p = p+1$. The interesting case is when $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. I wrote a program which computes $M_p$ where $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ is prime. We get the following sequence, where the $i$th term is the value of $M_p$ for the $i$th largest prime $p$ of the form $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, and I have computed here for all $p\\leq 1000$: $12, 12, 12, 36, 48, 36, 48, 84, 84, 84, 84, 84, 108, 108, 156, 156, 144, 156, 156, 192, 228, 228, 252, 252, 228, 300, 252, 252, 324, 336, 300, 372, 336, 372, 336, 372, 432, 372, 444, 432, 468, 468, 444, 444, 468, 516, 588, 588, 588, 624, 576, 588, 624, 588, 588, 684, 624, 624, 684, 732, 684, 684, 756, 804, 732, 768, 732, 756, 876, 876, 912, 804, 912, 876, 948, 972, 912, 948, 948, 1008, \\dots$ It seems that however many terms you take their GCD is always $12$, and this doesn't change as far as $p\\leq 3000$, so I have two questions: Can anyone prove that $M_p$ is always divisible by 12? Since 1992 when the book was published, has anyone found an expression for $M_p$? Any extra information about this sequence (or related topics/papers) is very welcome!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The numbers you actually want to look at turn out to be $$a_p = p + 1 - |C(\\mathbb{F}_p)|.$$ There is a lot to say about these numbers. The Hasse-Weil bound implies that $|a_p| \\le 2 \\sqrt{p}$. The Weil conjectures explain why this bound holds: it's because (for all but finitely many $p$) there is a pair of conjugate algebraic numbers $\\alpha_p, \\overline{\\alpha}_p$ of absolute value $\\sqrt{p}$ such that $$|C(\\mathbb{F}_{p^n})| = p^n + 1 - \\alpha_p^n - \\overline{\\alpha}_p^n$$ for all $n$, which gives $$a_p = \\alpha_p + \\overline{\\alpha}_p.$$ The Sato-Tate conjecture describes the asymptotic distribution of these numbers as $p$ varies. Finally, one way to state the modularity theorem (which was not a theorem when Silverman-Tate was published!) in this case is that there is a modular form $$f(q) = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} b_n q^n$$ which must be a \"normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenform of weight $2$ and level $N$,\" where $N$ is a positive integer called the conductor of $C$, such that $b_0 = 0$ (\"cuspidal\"), $b_1 = 1$ (\"normalized\"), and $$a_p = b_p$$ for all primes $p$ not dividing $N$. So essentially the best you can do as far as finding a formula for the $a_p$ goes is to find a concise description of this modular form. Sage informs me that this curve has conductor $36$ and that there is a unique normalized cusp form of weight $2$ and level $36$, which is necessarily the Hecke eigenform we want. This implies that $y^2 = x^3 + 1$ must in fact be (isogenous to?) the modular curve $X_0(36)$. The $q$-expansion of this modular form begins $$q - 4 q^7 + 2 q^{13} + 8 q^{19} - 5 q^{25} + \\dots$$ and according to this paper that I found , it is $\\eta (6 \\tau)^4$ where $\\eta$ is the Dedekind eta function . The $q$-expansion of this modular form, in full, is therefore $$f(q) = q \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{6n})^4.$$ See also the pentagonal number theorem , which leads to an expression for $a_p = b_p$ in terms of a signed sum over the set of ways $\\frac{p - 1}{6}$ can be written as a sum of $4$ pentagonal numbers. Edit: Here is a proof that $|C(\\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is divisible by $12$ when $p \\equiv 1 \\bmod 3$. As Greg Martin says in the comments, this is equivalent to showing that $C(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ has full 2-torsion and a 3-torsion point. The 2-torsion points on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass normal form are precisely those of the form $(x_0, 0)$, together with the point at infinity, and hence the number of 2-torsion points is the number of roots of $x^3 + 1$, plus one. Now, if $p \\equiv 1 \\bmod 6$, then $\\mathbb{F}_p^{\\times}$ contains an element of order $6$, and hence $\\mathbb{F}_p$ has all sixth roots of unity. Since the roots of $x^3 + 1$ are sixth roots of unity, it follows that $x^3 + 1$ has $3$ roots over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ in this case, and hence there are $4$ 2-torsion points, as desired. It remains to show that there is also a nontrivial $3$-torsion point. Recall that a point is $3$-torsion iff its tangent line intersects the curve with multiplicity $3$. In fact, the points $(0,\\pm 1)$ both have this property: their tangent lines take the form $y = \\pm 1, x = t$, and substituting this in gives $t^3 = 0$. So there are always at least $3$ 3-torsion points, as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question on Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe question is about the numbers M_p, which are the order of the group of rational points on the elliptic curve C_p: y² = x³ + 1 over the finite field F_p. The user mentions that for primes p ≡ 2 mod 3, they've proved M_p = p + 1. The focus is on primes p ≡ 1 mod 3. They computed a sequence of M_p values for such primes up to 1000 and observed that all are divisible by 12. They ask two things: whether it can be proven that M_p is always divisible by 12, and if there's any known expression for M_p since 1992.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that p is a prime ≥5. Then, the curve is defined as C_p: y² = x³ + 1 over F_p. The user specifically considers primes p ≡ 1 mod 3. Also, M_p is the number of rational points on C_p over F_p, including the point at infinity.\n\nSo each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥ 5.\n- C is the cubic curve defined by y² = x³ + 1 over the finite field F_p.\n- M_p is the order of the group of rational points of C over F_p (including the point at infinity).\n- p ≡ 1 mod 3.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions both cases p ≡ 2 mod 3 and p ≡ 1 mod 3, but the specific questions are about p ≡ 1 mod 3. So the assumptions should focus on the case where p ≡ 1 mod 3. The problem statement here is to prove that M_p is divisible by 12 and to ask about an expression for M_p.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. p is a prime number.\n2. p ≥ 5.\n3. The curve C is defined by y² = x³ + 1 over F_p.\n4. M_p is the number of F_p-rational points on C (including the point at infinity).\n5. p ≡ 1 mod 3.\n\nThe problem is two-fold: prove that M_p is always divisible by 12, and ask if there's a known expression for M_p since 1992. But according to the example given, the problem part should state the main problem to be solved. The user is asking two questions, but the example includes only one problem statement. However, the example's problem part includes the main question to prove divisibility by 91, so here the primary problem is to prove that M_p is divisible by 12. The second part is more of a follow-up question, but perhaps the user wants both as part of the problem. But looking at the example, the original problem had two parts but in the formatted version, only the main problem (proving divisibility) was listed. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" which was part of the original question. The other part (about 1992) might be a separate question, but perhaps the user wants to structure the main problem here as \"Prove that M_p is divisible by 12 and determine if there's an expression for M_p.\"\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was an additional condition. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem. Maybe that example is incorrect. But according to the user's example, they restructured the problem by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not have been in the original problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption or they filtered out some conditions. Hmm, this could be confusing. But perhaps the example is just illustrative.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem based on the given example. The original question includes that p is a prime ≥5, and the problem is about when p ≡1 mod 3. So the assumptions should include that p is a prime ≥5, p ≡1 mod 3, and the definition of C and M_p.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥ 5.\n- C is the elliptic curve defined by y² = x³ + 1 over the finite field F_p.\n- M_p is the number of F_p-rational points on C, including the point at infinity.\n- p ≡ 1 mod 3.\n\nThe problem is to prove that M_p is divisible by 12 and to inquire if an expression for M_p is known since 1992. However, the example given only includes one problem statement. The user might want to combine both questions into one problem statement, but perhaps the main focus is on proving divisibility by 12. The second part is a follow-up question. The example's problem part only had the main question, so maybe here the problem part should be \"Prove that M_p is always divisible by 12, and determine if an expression for M_p is known since 1992.\" But perhaps the user wants each problem separately. Alternatively, the problem part should state the main problem, which is to prove divisibility by 12, and the rest is additional context.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the original problem's hidden conditions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's formatted example added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, no. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example is a mistake, but the user wants us to follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user wants us to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the original problem's statement. In the current problem, the original question mentions that p is a prime ≥5, and p ≡1 mod 3. So those are assumptions. The problem is to prove M_p divisible by 12 and ask about the expression for M_p.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's general conditions. So in the example, the original problem's \"for every integer n\" becomes an assumption \"n is an integer,\" and then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7,\" which actually was not in the original problem. That suggests that the example might have a mistake, but the user wants us to extract all conditions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier. Wait, but in the original example, the problem is to prove for all integers n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which limits the problem. That seems like an error, but perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with necessary assumptions, even if they are not explicitly stated. Maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it in the assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the example is just illustrative of the format, not accurate in content.\n\nIn any case, I need to follow the user's format. For the current problem:\n\nOriginal question states:\n\n- p is a prime ≥5.\n- Curve C_p: y² = x³ +1 over F_p.\n- M_p is |C(F_p)|.\n- For p ≡2 mod3, M_p = p+1.\n- For p ≡1 mod3, computed M_p values and observed they're divisible by12.\n- Questions: prove M_p divisible by12 for p≡1 mod3; and whether an expression for M_p is known.\n\nThus, the assumptions for the problem (when focusing on the first question) are:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥5.\n- C is defined by y² = x³ +1 over F_p.\n- M_p is the number of F_p-rational points on C, including the point at infinity.\n- p ≡1 mod3.\n\nThe problem is to prove that M_p is divisible by12, and inquire about an expression for M_p since 1992. But according to the example, the problem part should be a single statement. However, the user's example included only the main problem (divisible by91) even though the original problem had a more general statement.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by91.\" The formatted problem was:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by91.\n\nBut that's inconsistent because the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by7,\" changing the problem. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the current problem's structure.\n\nIn the current case, the problem as posed by the user on Math Stack Exchange has two questions, but perhaps we should split them into two separate problem statements. However, the user's example combined them. Wait, no, the example only had one problem. Maybe the user wants us to structure the problem part as the main question to prove divisibility by12, and the other part about the expression is additional context but not part of the structured problem. However, the original example included the problem as stated, even if it had multiple parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem part should include both questions.\n\nBut looking at the user's example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by91,\" and the formatted problem listed two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by7) and the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by91.\" This suggests that perhaps the user is extracting all conditions from the problem, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. So in the current problem, the user mentions p is a prime ≥5, so those are assumptions. Also, p≡1 mod3 is another assumption. The problem is to prove M_p divisible by12.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥5.\n- C is the elliptic curve defined by y² = x³ +1 over F_p.\n- M_p is the number of F_p-rational points on C, including the point at infinity.\n- p ≡1 mod3.\n\nProblem: Prove that M_p is divisible by12, and determine if an expression for M_p is known since 1992.\n\nBut the example only included the problem statement, not the additional question. Maybe the user wants the problem part to be the main question to answer, which is proving divisibility by12. The second part is a follow-up, but according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example. The example included only the main problem, so perhaps here the problem part is \"Prove that M_p is divisible by12.\"\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange has two questions: can anyone prove M_p is divisible by12? And since 1992, has anyone found an expression? So both are parts of the problem. However, the example's problem part was a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the problem part should include both, separated by a comma or as two sentences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants only the first question as the problem, and the second as additional context. But according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the main question from the original problem and formatted it, possibly adding assumptions.\n\nSo considering that, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥5.\n- C is the elliptic curve defined by y² = x³ +1 over the finite field F_p.\n- M_p is the number of F_p-rational points on C, including the point at infinity.\n- p ≡1 mod3.\n\nProblem: Prove that M_p is divisible by12, and determine if an expression for M_p has been found since 1992.\n\nBut the example had only the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. Then another assumption (n divisible by7) was added, which might have been part of the problem's solution or a specific case. But in reality, the example seems incorrect. Anyway, moving forward.\n\nIn summary, the assumptions are p is prime ≥5, p≡1 mod3, curve definition, M_p definition. The problem is to prove divisibility by12 and ask about the expression. But following the example, maybe the problem part is just the first question, and the second is extra. However, the user's example included the main problem as stated. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, so the problem part should be the main question(s) from the original post. Since the original post has two questions, but the example only included one, perhaps the user wants both in the problem part. Alternatively, the example might have been a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≥5.\n- C is the cubic curve defined by y² = x³ +1 over the finite field F_p.\n- M_p is the order of the group of F_p-rational points on C, including the point at infinity.\n- p ≡1 mod3.\n\nProblem: Prove that M_p is always divisible by12, and determine if an expression for M_p has been discovered since 1992.\n\nBut perhaps the problem should be split into two, but the example uses a single problem statement. Alternatively, the second part is a separate question but included in the problem statement. Given the user's example, maybe just the first question is the main problem. However, in the original question, both are posed as questions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem part can be written as:\n\nProblem: Prove that M_p is divisible by12 and determine if an expression for M_p is known since 1992.\n\nBut the example's problem part was only one statement. Since the user's example included only the main problem (divisible by91), perhaps here the problem is to prove divisibility by12. The other question about the expression is additional but part of the original problem's text. However, the user wants us to structure the problem as per the example, which focuses on the main mathematical assertion. Therefore, the problem part should be \"Prove that M_p is divisible by12.\" The second question is more of a follow-up and might be considered as additional context, but not part of the core problem. But the user's original question includes both. Maybe the user wants both in the problem statement. Given the example is unclear, but the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which had one problem statement. Therefore, I will include both in the problem part, separated by a comma.",
