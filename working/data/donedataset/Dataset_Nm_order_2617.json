    "Content": "Edit:  I am seeking a solution that uses only calculus and real analysis methods -- not complex analysis.  This is an old advanced calculus exam question, and I think we are not allowed to use any complex analysis that could make the problem statement a triviality. Show that the series $$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n)}{\\log(n)}$$ converges. Any hints or suggestions are welcome. Some thoughts: The integral test is not applicable here, since the summands are not positive. The Dirichlet test does seem applicable either, since if I let 1/log(n) be the decreasing sequence, then the series of sin(n) does not have bounded partial sums for every interval. Thanks,",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified assumption and problem sections.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about showing that the series ∑(sin(n)/log(n)) from n=2 to infinity converges. The user mentioned they want a solution using only calculus and real analysis, not complex analysis. The title and question emphasize that.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption section lists each condition for one object. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each line is a single condition about a single object.\n\nLooking at the current problem: The series is from n=2 to infinity, terms are sin(n)/log(n). The problem mentions that the integral test isn't applicable because the terms aren't positive. Also, the user considered the Dirichlet test but thought that the partial sums of sin(n) might not be bounded. However, maybe there's a different approach here.\n\nNow, to extract assumptions. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The series starts at n=2. So the domain is n ≥ 2.\n2. The terms are sin(n)/log(n). So the sequence is a_n = sin(n)/log(n).\n3. The problem requires convergence of the series. The user wants to use calculus/real analysis methods, not complex analysis.\n4. The user tried Dirichlet test but was unsure because they thought the partial sums of sin(n) aren't bounded. However, actually, the partial sums of sin(n) are bounded. Wait, that's a crucial point. The Dirichlet test requires that the partial sums of the numerator (sin(n)) are bounded, and the denominator (1/log(n)) decreases to zero. So maybe the Dirichlet test is applicable here. But the user thought they aren't, so perhaps they made a mistake here. But regardless, the problem's assumptions should include the terms and the conditions given.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user says they are not allowed to use complex analysis. So that's an assumption about the method to be used. The problem requires the convergence of the series ∑ sin(n)/log(n). The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Let's parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal question: Show that the series ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n) converges, using only calculus and real analysis methods, not complex analysis.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n- The method must be within calculus and real analysis (so Dirichlet test is allowed since it's part of real analysis).\n- The terms are sin(n)/log(n) for integers n ≥ 2.\n\nBut the example given in the problem had assumptions listed as properties or conditions applied to one object each. For the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition on the same or different objects.\n\nIn this problem, the key conditions are:\n\n1. The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n2. The solution must use calculus/real analysis (excluding complex analysis). But perhaps the assumptions are more about the problem's mathematical conditions rather than the method. Wait, the example included an assumption about n being divisible by 7, which is a mathematical condition. The method (using real analysis) is a constraint on the solution, not an assumption of the problem itself. So perhaps the method isn't part of the assumptions but part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem as stated was to prove it for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed the assumption to include that n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user made a mistake. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong. But perhaps the example was a mistake, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the user wants us to list all assumptions in the problem. However, in the original example, the problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be \"n is an integer\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original. So maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, we have to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The problem is to show convergence of the series. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So:\n\n- The series starts at n=2.\n- The general term is sin(n)/log(n).\n- The problem requires a real analysis method (no complex analysis). But is this an assumption or a constraint? The example didn't include such constraints. The example included mathematical conditions. So perhaps the method is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n2. The terms are sin(n)/log(n) for integers n ≥ 2.\n\nBut the problem is to show convergence. However, perhaps the key mathematical conditions here are:\n\n- The sequence 1/log(n) is positive, decreasing, and approaches zero.\n- The partial sums of sin(n) are bounded.\n\nBut those are properties to verify for applying the Dirichlet test. But the user mentioned that they thought the Dirichlet test wasn't applicable because the partial sums of sin(n) aren't bounded. But in reality, the partial sums of sin(n) from n=1 to N are bounded. Let me recall that the sum sin(n) from n=1 to N can be expressed using a formula and is bounded. Hence, the partial sums are bounded, so the Dirichlet test applies. Therefore, the problem can be solved via Dirichlet's test, which is part of real analysis.\n\nBut since the user is unsure about that, maybe they need to consider another approach, but regardless, the problem's assumptions are just the terms of the series. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n- Each term is sin(n)/log(n) for integer n ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and n divisible by 7, which are conditions on n. Here, the problem is about the series, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n- The terms of the series are sin(n)/log(n).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was split into two lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. Therefore, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n ≥ 2.\n3. The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n\nBut the series itself is part of the problem, so maybe not. Alternatively, the problem is to show convergence of the given series, so the assumptions are the conditions on the terms. However, the problem as stated is just to show convergence, so the assumptions are the given terms. But the example includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" when the problem was about proving for every integer n. So perhaps the example is flawed. But following the example, perhaps we need to list the mathematical conditions here.\n\nBut in this problem, the problem is to show convergence of the series. The series is defined as starting at n=2, with terms sin(n)/log(n). The key assumptions here are that n is an integer ≥ 2, and the terms are as defined. However, since the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps here we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nthe terms of the series are sin(n)/log(n).\n\nBut maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, since the series is given, perhaps the assumptions are just the terms. However, following the example structure, the user included assumptions about the variable n. In the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- n ≥ 2,\n- the series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n\nBut maybe the series being ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n) is the problem's statement, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were about n. Similarly, here, the problem is to prove that the series converges, and the assumptions would be the conditions on n and the terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence a_n = sin(n)/log(n),\n- The summation starts at n=2.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. Since the problem is about the series ∑ sin(n)/log(n) from n=2 to infinity, the assumptions are that n is an integer ≥ 2, and each term is sin(n)/log(n). So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nthe general term of the series is sin(n)/log(n).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the series ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n) converges.\n\nBut the example's original problem had a function A(n) with assumptions on n, so maybe here the key assumptions are about the series terms. However, since the problem is straightforward, the main assumptions are the terms and the domain of n.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves a series, the assumptions could be:\n\n- The series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n),\n- sin(n) is a bounded function,\n- log(n) is positive and monotonically decreasing to zero as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut no, log(n) increases, so 1/log(n) decreases to zero. But in the problem, the term is sin(n)/log(n), which is not positive. However, the key conditions for convergence tests might be relevant here, but perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be just the given in the problem.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"filter the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the assumptions should be the given conditions of the problem. The original problem says: Show that the series ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n) converges. The user mentions they need a real analysis method, not complex analysis. But in the example, the method wasn't part of the assumption. So perhaps the method is part of the problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions on n. So here, the problem is \"Show that the series converges,\" and the assumptions would be the given conditions: n starts at 2, the terms are sin(n)/log(n), and n is an integer. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nthe series is ∑_{n=2}^∞ sin(n)/log(n).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the series converges.\n\nBut perhaps the series being ∑ sin(n)/log(n) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The example had \"A(n) = ...\" as part of the problem statement. So in the example, the assumptions were about n, and the problem was to prove something about A(n). Similarly, here, the assumptions are about n (integer, ≥2), and the problem is to show convergence of the series with terms sin(n)/log(n).\n\nBut in the example, the problem included the expression for A(n), which is part of the problem. So perhaps here, the problem statement should include the series expression, and the assumptions are the conditions on n.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the series $$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n)}{\\log(n)}$$ converges.\n\nBut the example included the expression in the problem statement. So yes, that's correct. The assumptions are about the variables involved, and the problem is the actual question with the series expression.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have assumptions about n being an integer and n ≥ 2, and the problem is to show convergence of the given series.",
