    "Content": "For $x,y,z >0$, prove that\n  $$\\frac{x}{y+z}+\\frac{y}{z+x}+\\frac{z}{x+y} \\geqslant \\sqrt{\\frac94+\\frac32 \\cdot \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy+yz+zx}}$$ Observation: This inequality is stronger than the famous Nesbitt's Inequality\n$$\\frac{x}{y+z}+\\frac{y}{z+x}+\\frac{z}{x+y} \\geqslant \\frac32 $$ for positive $x,y,z$ We have three variables but the symmetry holds only for two variables $y,z$, resulting in a very difficult inequality. Brute force and Largrange Multiplier are too complicated. The constant $\\frac32$ is closed to the best constant. Thus, this inequality is very sharp, simple AM-GM estimation did not work. Update: As point out by Michael Rozenberg, this inequality is still unsolved",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a proof. Using Lagrange's identity leads to $$\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x}{y+z}=\\frac32+\\frac12\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)} \\qquad (*)$$ We get this by letting $a = \\sqrt{x+y}$ , $b = \\sqrt{y+z}$ , $c = \\sqrt{z+x}$ , $d = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+y}}$ , $e = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y+z}}$ , $f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z+x}}$ , and by Lagrange's identity, $$(a^2+b^2+c^2)(d^2+e^2+f^2) = (ad+be+cf)^2 + (ae-bd)^2+(af-cd)^2+(bf-ce)^2$$ which gives $$2 (x+y+z)(\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{1}{y+z}) = 9 + \\sum_{cyc} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x+y}}{\\sqrt{y+z}} -  \\frac{\\sqrt{y+z}}{\\sqrt{x+y}}\\right)^2$$ or $$3 +\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x}{y+z} = \\frac92 + \\frac12\\sum_{cyc} \\frac{\\left({x+y} - (y+z)\\right)^2}{({y+z})(x+y)} $$ which is the desired equation $(*)$ . Squaring both sides of the inequality then gives $$\n\\tag{1} \\frac16 \\left[ \\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)}  \\right ]^2 + \\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)} \\geq \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy + yz + xz}\n$$ We will follow two paths for separate cases. Path 1: Omitting the square term   it suffices to prove $$\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)} \\geqslant  \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy + yz + xz}$$ Clearing denominators, we obtain $$\n(x-y)^2 (x+y) + (y-z)^2 (y+z) + (z-x)^2 (z+x) \\geq  \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy + yz + xz} (x+y) (y+z) (z+x)\n$$ Using $(x+y)(y+z)(x+z) = (x+y+z)(xy + yz+ xz) - x y z$ it suffices to show $$\n(x-y)^2 (x+y) + (y-z)^2 (y+z) + (z-x)^2 (z+x) \\geq  {(y-z)^2} (x+y+z)\n$$ or $$\n(x-y)^2 (x+y) +  (z-x)^2 (z+x) \\geq  (y-z)^2 x\n$$ Since $$\n (y-z)^2 = (y-x + x- z)^2 = (y-x)^2  + (x- z)^2 + 2 (y-x)(x-z) \n$$ this translates into $$\n(y-x)^2 y +  (x-z)^2 z \\geq  2 x(y-x)(x-z) \n$$ For the two cases $y\\geq x ; z\\geq x $ and $y\\leq x  ; z\\leq x $ the RHS $\\leq 0$ so we are done. For the other two cases, by symmetry, it remains to show the case $y>  x  ; z <  x $ . Rearranging terms, we can also write $$\n(y-x)^3 - (x-z)^3 +x ((y -  x) + (z-x))^2 \\geq 0\n$$ This holds true at least for $(y-x)^3 \\geq  (x-z)^3$ or $y+z\\geq 2 x$ . So the proof is complete other than for the case $y+z < 2x$ and [ $y>  x  ; z <  x $ or $z>  x  ; y <  x $ ]. Path 2. For the remaining case $y+z < 2 x $ and  [ $y>  x ; z <  x$ or $z>  x  ; y <  x $ ]  we will follow a different path. Again, by symmetry, we must inspect only $y+z < 2x$ and $y>  x > z$ . A remark up front: In the following, some high order polynomials of one variable have to be inspected. MATLAB is used, also for plotting behaviours of these polynomials. There is no case in spending effort for further analytical work on polynomials where their  behaviour is obvious. Still, what follows contains some \"ugly\" parts. In the squared version (1) of the inequality, we can use a further inequality which has been proved here : $$\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)} \\geqslant \\frac{27}{8} \\frac{(y-z)^2}{(x+y+z)^2}$$ So it suffices to prove $$\n\\frac16 \\left[ \\frac{27}{8} \\frac{(y-z)^2}{(x+y+z)^2} \\right ]^2 + \\sum_{cyc}\\frac{(x-y)^2}{(x+z)(y+z)} \\geq \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy + yz + xz}\n$$ Some numerical inspection shows immediately that the first term cannot be ommitted. Clearing some denominators gives $$\n\\tag{2} \\frac16 \\left[ \\frac{27}{8}  \\right ]^2 \\frac{(y-z)^4 (xy + yz + xz) (x+y)(y+z) (z+x)}{(x+y+z)^4} + \\\\\n (xy + yz + xz) \\sum_{cyc} {(x-y)^2}{(x+y)} - (y-z)^2 (x+y)(y+z) (z+x) \\geqslant 0 \\quad \n$$ By homogeneity, we set $y=1+z$ . The condition $y+z < 2x$ then translates into $1+2z < 2x$ , hence we further set $x = z + (1 +q)/2$ where $0\\leq q \\leq 1$ since also $x = z + (1 +q)/2 < y = 1 +z$ . Inserting $y=1+z$ and $x = z + (1 +q)/2$ into (2) is straightforward, the result is lengthy (not displayed here). Let us start with focussing  on the first term in (2) , calling that fraction $F$ : $$\nF= \\frac{(y-z)^4 (xy + yz + xz) (x+y)(y+z) (z+x)}{(x+y+z)^4} \n$$ With the setting $y=1+z$ this  can be simplified to $$\nF  = \\frac{(xy + yz + xz) (x+y)(y+z) (z+x)}{(x+y+z)^4} \n$$ Since by the settings $y=1+z$ and $x = z + (1 +q)/2$ both x and y are linear in z,  the numerator of $F$ is of fifth order in $z$ , whereas the denominator is of fourth order in $z$ . In leading order, the whole term is therefore of first order in $z$ and will therefore rise with $z$ for large enough $z$ . This motivates to show that  indeed $$F(q,z) \\geq F(q,z=0) = 2 \\frac{(q+1)^2}{(q+3)^2}$$ for all $z$ and $q$ . \nShowing  that directly requires a condition $$\nG = (xy + yz + xz) (x+y)(y+z) (z+x) (q+3)^2 - 2 (q+1)^2 (x+y+z)^4  \\geq 0\n$$ Inserting $y=1+z$ and $x = z + (1 +q)/2$ into $G$ , and expanding  the brackets,  gives a very lengthy expression which however contains only positive terms, so the condition is proved immediately: $$\nG = (z(2q^6z + 2q^6 + 22q^5z^2 + 51q^5z + 22q^5 + 80q^4z^3 + 358q^4z^2 + 357q^4z + 100q^4 + 96q^3z^4 + 960q^3z^3 + 1828q^3z^2 + 1206q^3z + 260q^3 + 864q^2z^4 + 3672q^2z^3 + 4788q^2z^2 + 2484q^2z + 450q^2 + 2592qz^4 + 7344qz^3 + 7398qz^2 + 3159qz + 486q + 2592z^4 + 5832z^3 + 4806z^2 + 1701z + 216))/4 \\geq 0\n$$ Hence it suffices, instead of (2) , to prove the following: $$\n\\tag{3} \\frac16 \\left[ \\frac{27}{8}  \\right ]^2 2 \\frac{(q+1)^2}{(q+3)^2} + \n (xy + yz + xz) \\sum_{cyc} {(x-y)^2}{(x+y)} \\\\ -  (x+y)(y+z) (z+x) \\geqslant 0 \\quad \n$$ After insertion of $y=1+z$ and $x = z + (1 +q)/2$ , the factors $(x-y)^2$ in the cyclic sum will not be functions of $z$ .  Hence,\nthe LHS  is a third order expression in $z$ with leading (in $z^3$ ) term $( 1 + 3 q^2) z^3$ , so for large enough $z$ it is rising with $z$ . A remarkable   feature of this expression is that for the considered range $0\\leq q \\leq 1$ it is actually monotonously rising for all $z$ . To see this, consider whether there are points with zero slope. The first derivative of the expression with respect to $z$ is $$\nq^4/4 + (7q^3z)/2 + (7q^3)/4 + 9q^2z^2 + 9q^2z + (5q^2)/4 - (7qz)/2 - (7q)/4 + 3z^2 + 3z + 1/2\n$$ Equating this to zero gives $$\nz_{1} = \n-(2((13q^6)/4 + (17q^4)/2 + (133q^2)/4 + 3)^{(1/2)} - 7q + 18q^2 + 7q^3 + 6)/(36q^2 + 12)\\\\\nz_{2} = \n-(-2((13q^6)/4 + (17q^4)/2 + (133q^2)/4 + 3)^{(1/2)} - 7q + 18q^2 + 7q^3 + 6)/(36q^2 + 12)\n$$ One now shows that in the range $0\\leq q \\leq 1$ , there are only negative solutions $z_{1,2}$ . So we will have no zero slopes for $z\\geq 0$ . Since the polynomials  are (roots of)  sixth order in q, we investigate the following figures: So monotonicity (rising with $z$ ) is established for all $q$ . Hence, to show the inequality it suffices to inspect (3) at the smallest $z=0$ . This gives $$\n((q + 1)(8q^6 + 88q^5 + 336q^4 + 432q^3 - 216q^2 - 405q + 243))/(64(q + 3)^3) \\geqslant 0 \\quad \n$$ or $$\n\\tag{4} 8q^6 + 88q^5 + 336q^4 + 432q^3 - 216q^2 - 405q + 243 \\geqslant 0 \\quad \n$$ An even stronger requirement is $$\nh(q) = \n432q^3 - 216q^2 - 405q + 243 \\geq 0\n$$ In the considered range $0\\leq q \\leq 1$ , $h(q)$ has a minimum which is obtained by taking the first derivative, $$\n1296 q^2 - 432 q - 405\n$$ and equating to zero, which gives $q = 3/4$ , and the above $h(q)$ then gives $$\nh(q = 3/4) = 0\n$$ This establishes the inequality. $ \\qquad \\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving a specific inequality that's stronger than Nesbitt's Inequality. The original problem states:\n\n\"For $x,y,z >0$, prove that\n$$\\frac{x}{y+z}+\\frac{y}{z+x}+\\frac{z}{x+y} \\geqslant \\sqrt{\\frac94+\\frac32 \\cdot \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy+yz+zx}}$$\"\n\nAdditionally, the observation mentions that this inequality is stronger than Nesbitt's and that it's still unsolved as per Michael Rozenberg.\n\nNow, according to the example, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the initial conditions are that x, y, z are positive real numbers. So the assumptions should include each variable being positive. However, in the example given, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate assumptions. But here, x, y, z are all positive. So perhaps each variable's positivity is a separate assumption? Wait, in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\" and the second \"n is divisible by 7\", both about the same object. But in this problem, we have three variables. So maybe each variable's positivity is a separate assumption. But in the example, they combined multiple conditions about the same variable. Wait, the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, both about n. So perhaps here, each variable's positivity is an assumption. However, the problem states \"for x, y, z >0\", which is a single condition applied to all three variables. But the example split different conditions on the same variable into separate lines. So in this case, should the assumption be \"x, y, z are positive real numbers\" as a single line, or split into three separate lines?\n\nLooking back at the example, the user wrote \"$n$ is an integer,\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$\" as two separate assumptions. So each condition on the same variable is a separate line. Therefore, perhaps in this problem, each variable's positivity is a separate assumption. But the original problem states \"for $x,y,z >0$\", which is a collective condition. However, the example's structure seems to require splitting each condition, even if they apply to different objects. Wait, in the example, both conditions apply to the same object n. Here, each variable x, y, z is a separate object, each with the condition of being positive. Therefore, following the example's logic, each variable's positivity should be a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number.\n\nBut wait, the original example had two assumptions about n. Here, we have three variables each with one condition. So three lines.\n\nThen the problem statement is to prove that inequality. The observation mentions that it's stronger than Nesbitt's inequality, but that's part of the context, not the problem statement itself. The problem is exactly as stated in the question: prove the given inequality.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\frac{x}{y+z}+\\frac{y}{z+x}+\\frac{z}{x+y} \\geqslant \\sqrt{\\frac94+\\frac32 \\cdot \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy+yz+zx}}$$\n\nWait, but the original problem mentions that the symmetry holds only for two variables y and z. However, in the formatted problem, the user's example didn't include observations, only the problem and assumptions. The example included an observation as part of the original problem but structured only the assumptions and problem. So in the formatted problem, the \"Observation\" part is not included in the assumptions or problem. Therefore, the user wants to extract only the necessary conditions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list the assumptions as each variable being positive, and the problem as proving the inequality. The fact that it's stronger than Nesbitt's is part of the context but not part of the problem statement. Similarly, the note about the inequality being unsolved is an observation, not part of the problem itself.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\frac{x}{y+z}+\\frac{y}{z+x}+\\frac{z}{x+y} \\geqslant \\sqrt{\\frac94+\\frac32 \\cdot \\frac{(y-z)^2}{xy+yz+zx}}$$\n\nThis adheres to the example's structure where the assumptions list each condition on each variable, and the problem is the exact statement to prove.",
