    "Content": "In the book Analysis I by Terence Tao, there is the following exercise:\n《Let $X $ be a set, show that $X $ is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset $Y $ of $X $ which has the same cardinality as $X $. (This exercise requires the Axiom of Choice)》 My attempt: If $X $ is finite, then it is trivial (by induction on the number of elements) If $X $ is infinite, then pick $x_0 $ in $X $, we will show a bijection between $X $ and $Y=X\\setminus \\{x_0\\} $.\nTake a sequence $(x_n ) $ of distinct elements of $Y $: (the definition of the sequence is by induction)\nIf we have already defined $x_i  $ for all $0\\leq i \\leq n $ for some $n $, then take $x_{n+1} $ to be any element in the non-empty set $Y\\setminus \\{x_1,\\ldots , x_n\\} $. \nThen take the bijection $f:X\\to Y  $ defined by $f (x)=x $ if $x\\neq x_i  $ for all $i \\geq 0$ and $f (x_i)=x_{i+1} $ otherwise.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "You use the axiom of choice while constructing the sequence $(x_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb N)$. To make this more apparent, we need to be a bit more formal in how you obtain such a sequence: Consider the set $S$ of all finite sequences $\\vec{y} = (y_n \\mid n \\le m)$ such that $y_0 = x_0$ as fixed above and such that for all $n < m$ $y_{n+1} \\in X \\setminus \\{ y_0, \\ldots, y_n \\}$. Now consider the relation $R$ on $S \\times S$ given by\n$$\n(y_0, \\ldots, y_m) R (z_0, \\ldots, z_l) : \\iff l > m \\wedge \\forall n \\le m \\colon y_n = z_n,\n$$ in simpler words: $\\vec{y}R\\vec{z}$ iff $\\vec{z}$ is an end-extension of $\\vec{y}$. Your induction proves that for all $\\vec{y} \\in S$ there is some $\\vec{z} \\in S$ such that $\\vec{y} R \\vec{z}$. The axiom of choice (it suffices to have the axiom of dependent choice ) now allows you to pick an infinite sequence $( \\vec{y}_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb N)$ such that for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$\n$$\n\\vec{y}_n R \\vec{y}_{n+1}.\n$$ If you now let $x_n$ be the $n$-th element of $\\vec{y}_n$, the resulting sequence $(x_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb N)$ is as desired. Note that this doesn't prove that some form of choice is necessary. It only highlights where you implicitly use the axiom of (dependent) choice. To see that, in general, we need some form of choice here is much harder and (for the moment) you really shouldn't worry about that.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the original question. The question is about proving that a set X is infinite if and only if it has a proper subset Y with the same cardinality. The user mentions that the exercise requires the Axiom of Choice (AC) but is confused about where AC is used in their attempted proof.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem statement from the book says \"Let X be a set\". So the first assumption is that X is a set. Then the exercise is to show an equivalence: X is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset Y of X with the same cardinality. The user's attempt involves constructing a sequence of distinct elements and defining a bijection. The user is questioning where AC is used because their construction seems to involve choosing elements step by step.\n\nSo the key assumptions here would relate to the conditions given in the problem. The problem is an \"if and only if\" statement, so each direction might have different assumptions. However, the user's specific attempt focuses on the direction where X is infinite, so they need to construct Y. The user's method involves selecting elements recursively, which might require the Axiom of Choice, specifically the Axiom of Dependent Choice, since each choice depends on the previous ones.\n\nThe original problem's assumptions would be:\n\n1. X is a set.\n2. The Axiom of Choice is available (as stated in the exercise note).\n3. For the forward direction: X is infinite.\n4. For the reverse direction: There exists a proper subset Y of X with the same cardinality as X.\n\nBut according to the example provided, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is asking about the equivalence, so maybe split the assumptions into the two directions. However, the user's question is specifically about the use of AC in their proof attempt, which is for the forward direction (assuming X is infinite and showing the existence of Y). The key point where AC comes in is in the recursive definition of the sequence (x_n), where each x_{n+1} is chosen from the non-empty set Y\\{x_1,...,x_n}. Since this requires infinitely many arbitrary choices, AC (or more precisely, the Axiom of Dependent Choice) is needed here.\n\nSo the assumptions for the problem as per the user's approach would include that X is a set, X is infinite, and that the construction of the sequence requires AC. But the original problem just states that the exercise requires AC. The user's confusion is why AC is needed here. Therefore, the problem as formatted should list the necessary assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Let X be a set, show that X is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset Y of X which has the same cardinality as X.\" The note mentions that the exercise requires AC. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a set.\n- The Axiom of Choice is assumed (as per the exercise's note).\n- For the forward direction: X is infinite.\n- For the reverse direction: Y is a proper subset of X with the same cardinality as X.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. The original problem's main assumptions are that X is a set, and the Axiom of Choice is used. The problem is to show the equivalence. However, the user's specific problem is in their attempted proof where they constructed a sequence, and they didn't see where AC is used. The answer would need to point out that the inductive definition of the sequence requires AC, as each step involves a choice without a specified rule.\n\nBut according to the format, the task is to structure the problem as per the given example, listing assumptions and the problem. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- X is a set.\n- The Axiom of Choice is available.\n- The problem requires showing an equivalence (if and only if).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. For the problem given here, the problem is to show that X is infinite iff there's a proper subset Y with the same cardinality. The exercise mentions that it requires AC, so the assumption here is that the Axiom of Choice is necessary for this proof.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions? The problem is about sets and their cardinality. The key assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a set.\n- (For the forward direction) X is infinite.\n- (For the reverse direction) Y is a proper subset of X with the same cardinality as X.\n- The Axiom of Choice is used in the proof.\n\nBut the user's question is specifically about their attempted proof and where AC is used. However, the format requires us to structure the problem as per the original question, not the user's confusion. The original problem is to prove the equivalence, with the note that AC is required. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a set,\nThe Axiom of Choice is used.\n\nProblem:\nShow that X is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset Y of X which has the same cardinality as X.\n\nBut the example given for divisibility had specific conditions. In that example, the original problem's assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, the user corrected it to list n as an integer (without the divisibility by 7, because the problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is just that n is an integer). Wait, the original example in the user's instruction had the problem statement as proving for every integer n, so the assumption is n is an integer. However, the formatted problem in the example mistakenly included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the correct assumption should just be n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. So maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants the assistant to correctly parse the original problem and list the assumptions properly.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is: Show that X is infinite iff there exists a proper subset Y with the same cardinality. The exercise mentions that this requires AC. Therefore, the assumptions should include that the Axiom of Choice is used. But in the problem statement, the only explicit assumption is that X is a set. The rest are parts of the equivalence to prove. However, the exercise mentions that AC is necessary, so perhaps the assumption is that AC is allowed/used.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a set,\nThe Axiom of Choice is available.\n\nProblem:\nShow that X is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset Y of X which has the same cardinality as X.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about their attempted proof where they constructed a sequence and didn't see where AC was used. However, the task here is to structure the original problem as per the given format, not the user's specific confusion. Therefore, the assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement and the note about AC. The problem is to prove the equivalence, with the note that AC is required.",
