    "Content": "There is an exercise in my lists about those functions:\n$$f(x, y) = (y-3x^2)(y-x^2) = 3 x^4-4 x^2 y+y^2$$ $$g(t) = f(vt) = f(at, bt); a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$$ It asks me to prove that $t = 0$ is a local minimum of $g$ for all $a, b\n\\in \\mathbf{R}$ I did it easily:\n$$g(t) = 3 a^4 t^4-4 a^2 t^2 b t+b^2 t^2$$\n$$g'(t) = 2 b^2 t-12 a^2 b t^2+12 a^4 t^3$$\n$$g''(t) = 2 b^2-24 a^2 b t+36 a^4 t^2$$ It is a critical point:\n$$g'(0) = 0; \\forall a, b$$ Its increasing for all a, b:\n$$g''(0) = 2b^2 > 0; \\forall b \\ne 0$$\nand\n$$b = 0 \\implies g(t) = 3 a^4 t^4$$\nwhich has only one minimum, at $0$, and no maximum However, it also asks me to prove that $(0, 0)$ is not a local minimum\nof $f$.  How can this be possible? I mean, if $(0, 0)$ is a minimum over\nevery straight line that passes through it, then, in this point, $f$\nshould be increasing in all directions, no?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Using the factorisation you have we note that $f$ is: zero on the curves $y=x^2$ and $y=3x^2$ negative when $x^2<y<3x^2$ positive  otherwise. Since there are points arbitrary close to $o=(0,0)$ that satisfy $x^2<y<3x^2$ (say $y=2x^2$ where $x$ is small) and points arbitrary close to $o$ that do not satisfy $x^2<y<3x^2$ (say $y=0$ and small $x$) we see that $o$ is not a local minimum. EDIT Note that in any neighbourhood of $o$ there is no line segment through $o$ which is contained in the region $x^2<y<3x^2$. 2nd Edit Draw a line through $o$, then there is a line segment surrounding $o$ such that the line segment has no point $(x,y)$ such that $x^2<y<3x^2$. I hope this is sufficiently clear - otherwise just ask! Descriptive picture",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking why (0,0) isn't a minimum of f(x,y) even though along every straight line through (0,0), the function has a local minimum at that point. Hmm, that seems contradictory. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A point is a local minimum if there's a neighborhood around it where all points have function values greater or equal. But here, even though every straight line through (0,0) has a local minimum there, the function itself might not have a local minimum. \n\nLet me think about the function f(x,y) = (y - 3x²)(y - x²). Let's expand it: 3x⁴ -4x²y + y². So, at (0,0), f(0,0) = 0. Now, if we check along any line through (0,0), like y = mx, substitute into f: (mx - 3x²)(mx - x²) = (x(m - 3x))(x(m - x)) = x²(m - 3x)(m - x). For small x, the dominant term is x²(m² - 4m x + 3x²) ≈ m² x². So, if m ≠ 0, then near x=0, this is positive, so f is positive, meaning (0,0) is a local minimum along that line. If m=0, then y=0, so f(x,0) = (0 -3x²)(0 -x²)= 3x⁴, which is also non-negative, so again a minimum.\n\nBut the problem states that (0,0) is NOT a local minimum for f. So even though all lines through (0,0) have minima, the function itself doesn't. How is that possible? \n\nMaybe because when approaching (0,0) along some curve that's not a straight line, the function takes negative values. For example, suppose we approach along the curve y = 2x². Then f(x, 2x²) = (2x² - 3x²)(2x² - x²) = (-x²)(x²) = -x⁴. So near (0,0), along this parabola, the function is negative, which is less than f(0,0)=0. Therefore, (0,0) can't be a local minimum because there are points arbitrarily close where f is negative.\n\nTherefore, even though every straight line through (0,0) has a local minimum there, the existence of a parabolic path where the function decreases below zero means the point isn't a local minimum for the function as a whole. This shows that the converse of the statement \"if a point is a local minimum along every line, then it's a local minimum for the function\" isn't true. The key is that the function can have different behavior along non-linear paths.\n\nSo, to structure the problem correctly: The assumptions are about the function f(x,y), the point (0,0), and the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to show that despite every straight line through (0,0) having a local minimum there, the point itself isn't a local minimum of f.",
