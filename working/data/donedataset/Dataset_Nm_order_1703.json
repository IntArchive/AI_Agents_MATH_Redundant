    "Content": "Question: ( Exercise 3.4.12 - Sharpe ) Let $H$ be a Lie group, $V$ a vector space, and $\\rho: H \\to Gl(V)$ a representation. Let $U$ be a manifold, $X$ a vector field on $U$, and $h: U \\to H$ and $f: U \\to V$ smooth functions. Show that $$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f) = \\rho(h^{-1})X(f) - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(H) )) f$$ where $\\omega_H$ is a Maurer-Cartan form. Attempt: Here are some of the results I have used so far $(i)$ If $\\iota : G \\to G$ is the inverse function of $G$ and $\\omega_H$ is a Maurer-Cartan form then $$\\iota^* \\omega_H(v) = - Ad(g)\\omega_H(v) \\,\\,\\, \\text{for}\\,\\,\\, v \\in T_g(G)$$ $(ii)$ A smooth map $f:N \\to M$ induces a pullback map $f^*: A^p(N,V) \\to A^p(M,V)$ defined by $$(f^*\\omega)_x (X_1, \\ldots, X_p) = \\omega_{f(x)} (f_*X_1, \\ldots,f_*X_p)$$\nwhere $X_1, \\ldots, X_p \\in T_x (M)$. By the Leibniz rule we have $$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f)  = \\rho (h^{-1})X(f) + X(\\rho(h^{-1}))f$$ Now the idea was to show that $X(\\rho(h^{-1})) = - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(H) ))$. Thus, using the chain rule, $(i)$ and $(ii)$ we get $$\\begin{align}X(\\rho(h^{-1}))|_h &\\underset{\\text{def}}= \\rho(h^{-1})_*(X_h)\\\\&\\underset{\\text{C.H.}}= (\\rho_{*e}h^{-1}_*)(X)\\\\&=[\\rho_{*e}(\\iota h)_*](X)\\\\&\\underset{\\text{C.H.}}=\\rho_{*e}[\\iota_* h_*(X)]\\\\&=\\rho_{*e}[L_{h*}\\circ L_{h^{-1}*}\\iota_* h_*(X)]\\\\&=\\rho_{*e}[L_{h*}\\omega_H(\\iota_* h_*(X))]\\\\&\\underset{\\text(ii)}=\\rho_{*e}[L_{h*}\\iota^*(\\omega_H(h_*X))]\\\\&\\underset{\\text{(ii)}}= \\rho_{*e}[L_{h*} \\iota^*(h^*\\omega_H(X))]\\\\&\\underset{\\text{(i)}}= -\\rho_{*e}[L_{h*}Ad(h)h^*\\omega_H(X) ]\\end{align}$$ this is what I got so far. $1)$ Is it correct? $2)$ What can be improved? $3)$ Where to go from here? 4) Should the vector field be considered left-invariant?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will proceed in a slightly different way than you did. The gist of the computations is of course the same. Let $u\\in U$, let $u(t):\\mathbb{R}\\to U$ be a smooth path such that $u(0) = u$ and $\\dot{u}(0) = X(u)$. Then\n\\begin{align}\nX\\left(\\rho\\left(h^{-1}\\right)\\right)(u) = & \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\rho\\left(h^{-1}(u(t))\\right)\\\\\n= & \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\rho\\left(\\iota(h(u)^{-1}h(u(t)))\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\\n= & (\\rho_*)_e\\left(\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\iota\\left(L_{h(u)^{-1}}h(u(t))\\right)\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\\n= & (\\rho_*)_e\\left(\\iota_*\\left(\\left(L_{h(u)^{-1}}\\right)_*\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}h(u(t))\\right)\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\\n= & (\\rho_*)_e\\left(\\iota^*\\left(\\omega_{h(u)}\\left(\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}h(u(t))\\right)\\right)\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\\n= & (\\rho_*)_e\\left(\\iota^*\\left(\\omega_{h(u)}\\left(h_*X(u)\\right)\\right)\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\= & -(\\rho_*)_e\\left(\\text{Ad}_{h(u)}\\omega_{h(u)}\\left(h_*X(u)\\right)\\right)\\rho(h(u))^{-1}\\\\\n\\end{align}\nIn the fifth line I used the fact that $\\iota_*=\\iota^*$ and the definition of the Maurer-Cartan form, and in the last line I used the identity you mentioned. in your notation, this reads\n$$X\\left(\\rho\\left(h^{-1}\\right)\\right) = -\\rho_{*e}\\left(\\text{Ad}(h)h^*\\omega_H\\right)\\rho\\left(h^{-1}\\right).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that a certain expression involving vector fields, Lie groups, and representations holds. The main equation to prove is:\n\n$$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f) = \\rho(h^{-1})X(f) - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(H) )) f$$\n\nGiven the assumptions and the attempt provided, I need to structure this properly. Let me start by listing out all the assumptions from the problem statement. The problem mentions several objects: H is a Lie group, V a vector space, ρ a representation, U a manifold, X a vector field on U, h and f smooth functions from U to H and V respectively. The Maurer-Cartan form ω_H is involved. The user also references some properties (i) and (ii), which are part of their attempt.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\n- H is a Lie group.\n- V is a vector space.\n- ρ: H → GL(V) is a representation.\n- U is a manifold.\n- X is a vector field on U.\n- h: U → H is a smooth function.\n- f: U → V is a smooth function.\n- ω_H is the Maurer-Cartan form on H.\n\nAdditionally, the problem uses some properties from their attempt, like (i) and (ii). But since those are part of their attempt, maybe they are not assumptions given by the problem but rather tools they used. The problem itself, as stated in the title and the question, is to derive the given expression. So the main problem is to show that equation holds under the listed assumptions.\n\nWait, the original problem in the Exercise is: Show that X(ρ(h⁻¹)f) equals the right-hand side. So the problem is to prove that identity. The user's attempt uses properties (i) and (ii), but those are part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions for the problem should be the given data: H, V, ρ, U, X, h, f, ω_H. The problem is to derive that equation.\n\nBut the user also mentions in their attempt that they used Leibniz rule, which is a general rule in calculus, so maybe that's not an assumption. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions on the vector field X, except that it's a vector field on U. The question 4) asks if X should be left-invariant, but the original problem didn't specify that, so maybe it's not part of the assumptions. However, in the problem's context, since h is a function from U to H, and ω_H is the Maurer-Cartan form (which is related to left-invariant vector fields), perhaps the problem is in a context where standard Lie group structures apply, but the problem doesn't specify left-invariance for X.\n\nSo, in the assumptions, we need to list all the given objects and their properties as per the problem statement. The problem is to show the given identity holds under those assumptions.\n\nNow, structuring the problem as per the example:\n\nAssumptions line by line, each addressing one property of one object. Then the problem statement.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Lie group,\nV is a vector space,\nρ: H → GL(V) is a representation,\nU is a manifold,\nX is a vector field on U,\nh: U → H is a smooth function,\nf: U → V is a smooth function,\nω_H is the Maurer-Cartan form on H.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f) = \\rho(h^{-1})X(f) - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(X) )) f$$\n\nWait, in the original problem, the term inside Ad(h) is h^*ω_H(H). Wait, the user wrote h^*ω_H(H). But H is the Lie group here. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because h is a function from U to H, so h^*ω_H would be a pullback of the Maurer-Cartan form, which is a 1-form on H. So h^*ω_H is a 1-form on U. Then h^*ω_H(X) would be evaluating that 1-form on the vector field X, which gives a function from U to the Lie algebra of H, since ω_H is Lie algebra-valued.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote h^*ω_H(H). But H is the Lie group. Maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be h^*ω_H(X), since X is the vector field. So in the problem statement, the term inside Ad(h) should be h^*ω_H(X). That seems more consistent with the context.\n\nLooking at the user's attempt, in their calculation they have h^*ω_H(X). For example, in their step using (i) and (ii), they mention h^*ω_H(X). So maybe in the original problem statement, the user mistyped H instead of X. Because H is a Lie group, and h is a function from U to H. So h^*ω_H is a 1-form on U, so when you apply it to a vector field X on U, you get h^*ω_H(X), which is a function U → 𝔥 (the Lie algebra). Therefore, Ad(h) of that would be Ad(h)(h^*ω_H(X)), which is then plugged into ρ_{*e}.\n\nTherefore, the correct term in the problem should be h^*ω_H(X), not H. So perhaps that's a typo in the original problem. So when structuring the problem, we should correct that? Or leave as is? Since the user wrote \"h^*ω_H(H)\", but maybe that's a mistake. Since H is the Lie group, h^*ω_H is a form on U, so acting on a vector field on U. So H is not a vector field here. So likely, the correct term is h^*ω_H(X). Therefore, in the problem statement, the term should be h^*ω_H(X). Therefore, in the formatted problem, I should write h^*ω_H(X) instead of h^*ω_H(H).\n\nBut the user's original problem statement says \"Ad(h)(h^*ω_H(H))\", but perhaps that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"H\" here is a placeholder for something else. Wait, no. The Maurer-Cartan form ω_H is a 1-form on H, so h^*ω_H is a 1-form on U. Therefore, h^*ω_H evaluated at a vector field on U. So the correct expression is h^*ω_H(X). Therefore, in the problem statement, the correct term is X, not H. So in structuring the problem, I should correct that typo. But since the user wrote \"h^*ω_H(H)\", maybe they intended something else. However, given the context, I think X is correct here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"H\" here is a vector field, but in the problem statement, H is the Lie group. So that's conflicting. So I think it's a typo. Therefore, the correct term is h^*ω_H(X). Therefore, in the formatted problem, the term inside Ad(h) is h^*ω_H(X).\n\nSo, the problem should be written as:\n\nShow that $$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f) = \\rho(h^{-1})X(f) - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(X) )) f$$\n\nBut let me check the user's attempt. In their calculation, they have:\n\n\"ι^*ω_H(v) = - Ad(g)ω_H(v) for v ∈ T_g(G)\"\n\nIn their steps, they have h^*ω_H(X), so in their problem statement, they probably meant h^*ω_H(X). Therefore, the user's original problem statement likely has a typo, writing H instead of X. So as a knowledgeable professor, I should correct that in the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem will have h^*ω_H(X) in the expression.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Lie group,\nV is a vector space,\nρ: H → GL(V) is a representation,\nU is a manifold,\nX is a vector field on U,\nh: U → H is a smooth function,\nf: U → V is a smooth function,\nω_H is the Maurer-Cartan form on H.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$X(\\rho (h^{-1})f) = \\rho(h^{-1})X(f) - \\rho_{*e}(Ad(h)(h^*\\omega_H(X) )) f$$\n\nThat seems correct. The user's original problem had \"h^*ω_H(H)\", but that's likely a typo, and replacing H with X makes sense given the context. So the formatted problem should reflect that correction.",
