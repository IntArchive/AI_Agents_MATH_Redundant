    "AcceptedAnswer": "I believe Julien's proof is right and is also elegant, although there are a lot of typos in his write up. I'll rewrite it here (as Community Wiki), since there seems to be some doubt about that. Of course, this doesn't answer Julien's request for a different proof, but I see nothing wrong with his proof I introduce the notation $Z(h)$ for the number of zeroes of $h$ on $(-1,1)$. Let $f$ be as stated. If $f$ vanishes on $(-1,1)$ we are done so, without loss of generality, let $f(x)$ be positive on $(-1,1)$. For any positive integer $k$, define\n$$\ng:=x\\to \\frac{f(x)}{(1-x^2)^k} \\mbox{ for } |x|<1, \\mbox{ and } 0 \\mbox{ otherwise}\n$$ \nL'Hospital's rule shows that $g$ is in $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{R})$, and $g$ is identically zero outside $(-1,1)$. Choose $k$ such that \n$$\n0 = f(-1) \\ < \\ f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (1-\\frac14)^{-k} \\ >\\  f(0)\\  < \\ f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (1-\\frac14)^{-k}  \\ > \\ f(1) = 0.\n$$\nSo\n$$\n0 = g(-1) \\ < \\ g(-1/2) \\ >\\  g(0)\\ <\\  g(1/2)\\ >\\ g(1) = 0.$$ Then $g'$ must be positive somewhere on $(-1,-1/2)$, negative somewhere on $(-1/2,0)$, positive somewhere on $(0,1/2)$ and negative somewhere on $(1/2,1)$. Thus $Z(g^{(1)}) \\geq 3$, and the result holds for $g$ (instead of $f$), with $n=1$. We will show that $Z(f^{(2k+1)}) \\geq 2k+3$. Lemma Let $p(x)$ be identically $0$ outside $(-1,1)$ and let $a$ be a real number not in $(-1,1)$. Set $q(x) = p(x) (x-a)$. Then $Z(q^{(n+1)}(x)) \\geq Z(p^{(n)}(x))+1$. Proof Let the zeroes of $p^{(n)}$ be $-1 < r_1 < r_2 < \\cdots < r_m < 1$ and set $r_0=-1$ and $r_{m+1}=1$. Then $(x-a)^{n+1} p^{(n)}(x)$ vanishes at all the $r_i$, so by Rolle's theorem, $Z(\\frac{d}{dx} ( (x-a)^{n+1} p^{(n)}(x) )) \\geq m+1$. But $\\frac{d}{dx} ( (x-a)^{n+1} p^{(n)}(x) ) = (x-a)^n q^{(n+1)}$, and $(x-a)^{n}$ doesn't vanish on $[-1,1]$, so $Z(q^{(n+1)}) \\geq m+1$ as desired. $\\square$ Basically, the lemma says that throwing in a non vanishing linear factor doesn't make the Rolle's theorem bound worse. Now set $h_0 = g$, $h_1 = (1-x) h_0$, $h_2 =  (1+x) h_1$, $h_3 = (1-x) h_2$, $h_4 = (1+x) h_3$ etcetera, until $h_{2k} = (1-x^2)^k h_0 = f$. Applying the lemma repeatedly gives\n$$Z(f^{(2k+1)}) \\geq Z(h_{2k-1}^{(2k)} )+1 \\geq Z(h_{2k-2}^{2k-1})+2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq Z(h_0^{(1)}) + 2k \\geq 3+2k$$\nas desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that for a smooth function f that's zero outside (-1,1), there exists some natural number n such that the nth derivative of f has at least n+1 zeros in (-1,1). \n\nFirst, the original problem states that f is in C^∞(ℝ,ℝ) and vanishes outside (-1,1). So the assumptions here are about the smoothness and the compact support of f. The user's attempt assumes f is strictly positive, but that's their own approach, not part of the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that there exists n∈ℕ such that f^(n) has at least n+1 zeros\". The user tried using Rolle's theorem iteratively, getting Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ Z(f^{(k)}) +1, leading to Z(f^{(n)}) ≥ n. But they need to get n+1. So they need an additional zero somewhere.\n\nThe assumptions from the problem should be:\n\n1. f is infinitely differentiable from ℝ to ℝ.\n2. f(x) = 0 for all x not in (-1,1).\n\nThe problem is to show there exists n∈ℕ where f^(n) has at least n+1 zeros in (-1,1).\n\nWait, the user's attempt starts by assuming f is strictly positive (if not, then n=0 works because f has zeros). But in the original problem, f is zero outside (-1,1), but inside could have zeros or not. So if f is identically zero, then all derivatives are zero, but that's trivial. If f is non-zero somewhere inside, then the problem is non-trivial.\n\nThe user applied Rolle's theorem to each derivative, noting that each derivative must be zero at the endpoints -1 and 1 because f is zero outside, so all derivatives at -1 and 1 are zero. So between each zero of f^{(k)}, there's at least one zero of f^{(k+1)}, hence the count increases by at least 1 each time. Starting from f itself: if f is not identically zero, then f has some zeros. Wait, no, actually, if f is zero outside (-1,1) but non-zero inside, it must tend to zero at the endpoints. So f(-1)=0 and f(1)=0. If f is not identically zero, then it has at least two zeros (at -1 and 1) but maybe more in between. Wait, actually, f itself is zero at -1 and 1, but inside (-1,1), it's smooth. So if f is not identically zero, then between -1 and 1, it must have at least one critical point? Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nWait, the user's argument starts with Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ Z(f^{(k)}) +1. For example, starting with f itself: f(-1)=f(1)=0. If f is not identically zero, then by Rolle's theorem, there exists at least one zero of f’ in (-1,1). So Z(f’) ≥ 1. Then for f’’, since f’ has at least 1 zero, Rolle gives f’’ has at least 2 zeros, etc. Wait, but the user's induction gives Z(f^{(n)}) ≥ n. But the problem requires n+1. So they need to find an extra zero in some derivative.\n\nAh, maybe the initial step is missing a zero. If f is zero at -1 and 1, and suppose f is positive in between. Then f’ must have at least one zero in (-1,1) (by Rolle), but f’ also must approach zero at the endpoints because f is smooth. Wait, but if f is zero outside (-1,1), then all derivatives at x=±1 are zero. So for f’, we have f’(-1)=0 and f’(1)=0. Because the derivative from the right at -1 and left at 1 must be zero since f is constant (zero) outside. Therefore, f’ is a function that is zero at -1 and 1, and if f is not identically zero, f’ has at least one critical point in (-1,1). Wait, but f’ itself is zero at the endpoints. So applying Rolle's theorem to f’ on [-1,1], if f’ has Z zeros, then f'' has at least Z-1 zeros. Wait, maybe the user's approach is missing something here.\n\nWait, the user says that for each k, f^{(k)}(-1)=f^{(k)}(1)=0. Therefore, when you take f^{(k)}, it has zeros at -1 and 1. So between each pair of consecutive zeros of f^{(k)}, there's a zero of f^{(k+1)}. But if f^{(k)} has m zeros in (-1,1), then f^{(k+1)} has at least m-1 zeros. But since f^{(k)} also is zero at -1 and 1, so actually, the total number of zeros of f^{(k)} is m, including the endpoints. So between each of these m+1 intervals (including from -1 to first zero, between zeros, and last zero to 1), Rolle's theorem gives a zero of f^{(k+1)}. Wait, no. If f^{(k)} has m zeros inside (-1,1), but since it's zero at -1 and 1, the total zeros including endpoints are m+2? Wait, no. If f^{(k)} is zero at -1 and 1, and has m zeros inside (-1,1), then total zeros are m + 2. Then applying Rolle between each pair of consecutive zeros, there are (m + 2 - 1) = m +1 intervals, so f^{(k+1)} has at least m +1 zeros. So actually, if Z(f^{(k)}) = m +2 (including endpoints), then Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ m +1. But since the endpoints for f^{(k+1)} are also zero (because f^{(k)} is zero at endpoints and derivatives at endpoints are zero as well), then for f^{(k+1)}, we have that it's zero at -1 and 1, and has at least m +1 zeros inside. Therefore, Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ m +1 +2? Wait, no. Wait, the zeros of f^{(k+1)} are inside (-1,1) because the endpoints are also zeros. Wait, no. The derivatives at the endpoints are zero, but the endpoints themselves are part of the domain. So f^{(k)}(-1)=0 and f^{(k)}(1)=0 for all k. Therefore, for f^{(k)}, the zeros at the endpoints are fixed. So when considering the zeros of f^{(k)} in [-1,1], it's zeros at -1, some in between, and 1. So if f^{(k)} has Z_k zeros in (-1,1) and the two endpoints, then total zeros is Z_k + 2. Then, applying Rolle's theorem between each pair of consecutive zeros (including the endpoints), which are Z_k + 2 zeros, leading to Z_{k+1} ≥ (Z_k +2) -1 = Z_k +1. But the endpoints for f^{(k+1)} are also zeros. So the zeros of f^{(k+1)} would be at least Z_k +1, but since the endpoints are also zeros, does that mean Z_{k+1} is Z_k +1 +2? No, because the endpoints are already counted as zeros for f^{(k+1)}. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose for f^{(k)}, we have zeros at -1, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m, 1. So total of m+2 zeros. Applying Rolle's theorem between each consecutive pair, we get a zero of f^{(k+1)} in each interval. So between -1 and x_1, there's a zero; between x_1 and x_2, etc., and between x_m and 1. So total of (m+2 -1) = m+1 zeros. But these zeros are in (-1,1). However, f^{(k+1)} also has zeros at the endpoints -1 and 1. Wait, no, because f^{(k+1)}(-1) = 0 and f^{(k+1)}(1)=0, because f is zero outside. So actually, f^{(k+1)} has zeros at -1 and 1, and at least m+1 zeros in between. Therefore, the total number of zeros for f^{(k+1)} is at least m+1 +2? But the user is counting zeros on (-1,1), excluding the endpoints? Or including?\n\nWait, the problem states \"zeros on (-1,1)\". The user wrote Z(f^{(n)}) as the number of zeros on (-1,1). So if the endpoints are excluded, then even though f^{(k)}(-1)=0, it's not counted in Z(f^{(k)}). Wait, but the problem statement says \"on (-1,1)\", which is open interval. So the endpoints are not included. Therefore, when the user applies Rolle's theorem, they are only considering the zeros inside (-1,1). But f^{(k)}(-1)=f^{(k)}(1)=0, which are not in (-1,1). So for example, f itself is zero at -1 and 1, but inside (-1,1), it may have zeros. If f is positive inside (-1,1), then Z(f) =0 (since it's only zero at endpoints). But then applying Rolle's theorem between -1 and 1, there must be at least one critical point in (-1,1), so f’ has at least one zero in (-1,1). Then Z(f’) ≥1. Then f'' would have at least two zeros, etc. But according to the user's induction, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. But the problem requires n+1. So where does the extra zero come from?\n\nWait, maybe the user made a miscalculation. Let's see. Suppose f is non-zero in (-1,1), so Z(f)=0. Then f’ must have at least 1 zero (Rolle's theorem applied between -1 and 1). So Z(f’) ≥1. Then f'' must have at least Z(f’)+1=2 zeros. Wait, but according to the user's induction, they get Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. If starting from Z(f)=0, then Z(f^{(1)})≥1, Z(f^{(2)})≥2, ..., Z(f^{(n)})≥n. But the problem wants Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1. So how to get that extra zero?\n\nAh, maybe the original function f is not identically zero, so there's a maximum or minimum in (-1,1). If f is positive in (-1,1), then it has a maximum, so f’ starts at zero (at -1), increases to the maximum, then decreases back to zero at 1. So f’ has at least one critical point, which is a zero of f''. But according to the user's induction, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. But the problem requires n+1. Therefore, perhaps there's an additional zero coming from some other consideration. Maybe using the fact that all derivatives vanish at the endpoints? For example, considering the function and its derivatives must be flat at the endpoints. Maybe using the Identity Theorem or something else? Or perhaps the user's induction is missing an initial step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem requires that for some n, not for all n. So even if for each n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n, but the problem wants there exists an n where it's at least n+1. So the user's current approach shows Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n for all n, but need to show that for some n, it's at least n+1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"there exists n∈ℕ\" such that Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1. So if for all n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n, then in particular, for each n, it's at least n. But to get n+1, maybe for some n, the count actually increases by more than 1. For example, if at some derivative, the number of zeros increases by 2 instead of 1. That would mean that Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ Z(f^{(k)}) +2 for some k, leading to Z(f^{(k)}) ≥k +1.\n\nBut under what condition would that happen? If between two zeros of f^{(k)}, there are two zeros of f^{(k+1)}. That requires that f^{(k)} has a local maximum and minimum in that interval, leading to two zeros for the derivative. But that would require that f^{(k)} has a critical point in the interval. However, if the function is analytic, then the zeros are isolated, but since f is C^∞, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's initial assumption that Z(f^{(k+1)}) ≥ Z(f^{(k)}) +1 is not always tight. For example, if f^{(k)} has a multiple zero, then f^{(k+1)} might have more zeros. But in the case of simple zeros, each interval between zeros of f^{(k)} gives exactly one zero of f^{(k+1)}.\n\nWait, but if the function f is not identically zero, then by the existence of compact support and being smooth, it must have all derivatives zero at the endpoints. But maybe using the fact that such functions (non-zero) cannot have all derivatives with only n zeros. For example, applying the Borel's theorem or something else. Alternatively, using the concept of the Pólya–Szegő theorem or the like.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for all n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≤n. Then, by repeated application, the function would have to be a polynomial, but since f is compactly supported, the only polynomial that is zero outside (-1,1) is the zero function. Hence, if f is non-zero, then there must exist some n where Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nAh, this might be the approach. If f is non-zero, it cannot be a polynomial (as non-zero polynomials don't have compact support), so for some n, the nth derivative must have enough zeros to contradict being a polynomial. Therefore, there must exist an n where the number of zeros exceeds n, hence Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nBut the user's current approach only gives Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. So there's a gap here. Therefore, to bridge this, we need to argue that the inequality Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n cannot hold indefinitely for a non-zero function. Because if it did, then after some n, the nth derivative would be a non-zero polynomial of degree d, which can have at most d zeros. But if we have Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n, but if f is smooth and not a polynomial, then its derivatives do not eventually become zero. Wait, but if f is compactly supported and smooth, it's in the space of bump functions, which are not analytic unless they are identically zero. So non-analytic smooth functions can have derivatives that don't become zero. But how does that relate to the number of zeros?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that if f is not identically zero, then there exists some minimal n such that f^{(n)} is not identically zero. Then, for that n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n, but since it's not identically zero, perhaps it must have more zeros. Wait, but that's not necessarily obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's induction step is missing the fact that when you start with Z(f) ≥0 (assuming f is non-zero), and each step adds 1, so after n steps, you have Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. But since f is zero at the endpoints, maybe there's an extra zero in some derivative due to the function being flat at the endpoints. For example, consider that all derivatives at -1 and 1 are zero, which implies that the function is \"infinitely flat\" there. This might force the derivatives to oscillate more, creating additional zeros.\n\nAlternatively, consider the Taylor series expansion at x=1. Since all derivatives are zero, the Taylor series is zero, but the function is non-zero in (-1,1). This is only possible if the function is flat at the endpoints but non-zero inside. Such functions (bump functions) are classic examples of smooth non-analytic functions. However, the behavior of their derivatives' zeros might require more analysis.\n\nAnother approach: Assume that f is not identically zero. Then there exists some smallest integer m such that f^{(m)} is not identically zero. Then for all k < m, f^{(k)} is identically zero, which contradicts the assumption unless m=0. Wait, no. If f is non-zero, then all derivatives cannot be identically zero. So actually, there is no such m. Therefore, all derivatives are non-zero. Wait, but if f is a bump function, then all derivatives exist and are smooth, but they are non-zero until they become zero after some point? No, bump functions are smooth and all their derivatives are non-zero except at the endpoints. Wait, no. For example, the standard bump function f(x) = e^{-1/(1-x²)} for |x| <1 and zero otherwise. All derivatives at ±1 are zero, but in the interior, the derivatives are non-zero except at specific points.\n\nBut how does the number of zeros grow? For such a function, the first derivative might have one zero, the second derivative two zeros, etc., each time adding one. But according to the user's induction, Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. The problem wants to find an n where Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nPerhaps the key is that if the function is not identically zero, then the sequence Z(f^{(n)}) must eventually exceed any linear bound. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if f is compactly supported and smooth, then its Fourier transform is analytic, but this seems off track.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that if for all n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≤n, then f is a polynomial. Since f is compactly supported, the only polynomial is zero. Therefore, if f is non-zero, there must exist some n with Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nYes, this seems like a plausible approach. The user's current proof shows that Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n for all n. If f is a non-zero polynomial, then it cannot be compactly supported unless it's zero. So if f is non-zero, it cannot be a polynomial, so there must exist some n where Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1. Because for a polynomial of degree d, the nth derivative for n >d is zero, but since f is not a polynomial, its derivatives never become zero. Therefore, the number of zeros must eventually exceed n, leading to the existence of some n where Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nBut how to formalize this? If we assume that for all n, Z(f^{(n)}) ≤n, then f is a polynomial. Since the user's induction gives Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n, combining these would imply that Z(f^{(n)}) =n for all n, which would imply f is a polynomial. But since f is compactly supported and smooth, f must be zero. Hence, if f is non-zero, there must exist some n where Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n+1.\n\nTherefore, the key assumption is that f is non-zero. But the problem states \"Prove that there exists n∈ℕ such that f^{(n)} has at least n+1 zeros...\", so even if f is zero, then all derivatives are zero, so for n=0, f has infinitely many zeros, which is ≥1 (0+1). But the problem likely considers f non-zero. However, the problem statement doesn't specify f is non-zero. But the user's attempt starts by assuming f is strictly positive, implying they are considering non-zero f.\n\nSo, the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. f ∈ C^∞(ℝ,ℝ)\n2. f(x) = 0 for all x ∈ ℝ \\ (-1,1)\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists n ∈ ℕ such that f^{(n)} has at least n+1 zeros in (-1,1).\n\nThe user's attempt uses Rolle's theorem to show that each derivative has at least one more zero than the previous, leading to Z(f^{(n)}) ≥n. To reach n+1, the argument needs an additional zero. The insight is that if f is non-zero, it cannot be a polynomial, so for some n, the nth derivative must have more than n zeros. Hence, the existence of such n follows by contradiction if assuming all derivatives have exactly n zeros (which would imply f is a polynomial, contradicting compact support unless f=0).\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions and state the problem accordingly.",
