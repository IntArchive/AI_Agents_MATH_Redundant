    "Content": "Question: Can we show that $$\\phi=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{11}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(2n)!}{5^{3n+1}(n!)^2} $$ ; where $\\phi={1+\\sqrt{5} \\above 1.5pt 2}$ is the golden ratio ? Some background and motivation: Wikipedia only provides one series for the golden ratio - see also the link in the comment by @Zacky. I became curious if I could construct another series for the Golden Ratio based on a slight modification to a known series representation of the $\\sqrt{2}.$ At first I considered $$\\sqrt{2}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^{n+1}\\frac{(2n+1)!!}{(2n)!!}$$ ; which series can be accelerated via an Euler transform to yield $$\\sqrt{2}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty(-1)^{n+1}\\frac{(2n+1)!!}{2^{3n+1}(n!)^2}$$ This last series became the impetus to try and and get to the Golden ratio. Through trial and error I stumbled upon $$\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{11}=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(2n)!}{5^{3n+1}(n!)^2}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all note that $$\\frac1{\\sqrt{1-4x}}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{2n}n x^n$$ Lets rewrite your sum as the following $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(2n)!}{5^{3n+1}(n!)^2}=\\frac15\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\binom{2n}n\\left(\\frac1{5^3}\\right)^n=\\frac15\\frac1{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac4{5^3}\\right)}}=\\frac{\\sqrt 5}{11}$$ And therefore you can correctly conclude that $$\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{11}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(2n)!}{5^{3n+1}(n!)^2}=\\frac12+\\frac{11}2\\frac{\\sqrt 5}{11}=\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}2$$ $$\\therefore~\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{11}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(2n)!}{5^{3n+1}(n!)^2}=\\phi$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem statement. My task is to filter out unrelated information and present the problem with its assumptions.\n\nThe original question is about showing that the golden ratio φ can be expressed as a specific series. The user mentions some background about modifying a series for sqrt(2), but that's probably part of the motivation, not the problem itself. The actual problem to solve is the equation given: φ = 1/2 + (11/2) times the sum from n=0 to infinity of [(2n)!)/(5^{3n+1} (n!)^2]. They also mention that sqrt(5)/11 equals another similar sum, but that seems like a step they took in their process, not part of the problem to be solved.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would need to be any conditions or properties that are given in the problem. The problem statement is to prove that the series equals φ. Looking at the example provided, assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer, etc.), but in this case, the problem is to show an equality involving φ and a series. Are there any implicit assumptions here? For instance, does the series converge? Maybe the user is assuming convergence, but since the problem is to show the equality, perhaps the only assumption is that φ is defined as (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Wait, the problem states φ is the golden ratio, so maybe that's part of the problem statement. However, in the example, they listed assumptions about n. Here, there's no variable with conditions; it's about an identity. So perhaps there are no specific assumptions other than the definition of φ. But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's given. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So here, perhaps the problem is to show the equality given that φ is the golden ratio. But since the problem is to show that φ equals that series, maybe there are no separate assumptions needed. Wait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, that might have been an error in the example? Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it by adding the assumption. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Hmm. Regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking back at the current problem: The question is to show that φ, defined as (1 + sqrt(5))/2, equals the given series. Are there any assumptions here? The problem seems to be purely an identity. The series is given, and φ is defined. Perhaps the assumption is that the series converges? But since the problem is to show equality, maybe convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes convergence and asks to show the sum equals φ. However, in mathematical proofs, usually, you need to prove convergence as part of showing the equality. But the user's example didn't include convergence as an assumption. Let me check the original example again. The example was about divisibility, so assumptions were on n. Here, the problem is about an infinite series. The user in their question mentions that they constructed the series through trial and error, but that's background. The problem itself is to show the series equals φ. So maybe the only assumption is that φ is the golden ratio, but that's part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem says \"where φ = ... is the golden ratio\". So perhaps there are no separate assumptions, just the problem statement. However, the example had assumptions listed even though the original problem didn't explicitly state them. Maybe in this case, since there's no variable with conditions, the assumptions section would be empty. But the format requires the Assumption section. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But in the current problem, there's no variable; it's about an identity involving φ. So maybe there are no assumptions, but the format requires at least one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the series converges, but the user might not state that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is presented as is, and the assumption is that the series is convergent. But since the problem is to show the equality, including convergence, perhaps there's no assumption needed. However, according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, they were extracted. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\". Then, there was another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems odd. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that in some cases, assumptions are to be extracted from the problem even if not explicitly stated. But in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem by filtering unrelated info. The original question's title is \"A Series For the Golden Ratio\", and the problem is to show that φ equals that series. The background talks about modifying a series for sqrt(2), but that's motivation. So, the formatted problem should have the problem statement as given, and the assumptions would be any conditions required. But since there are no variables here, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of φ. However, the problem already states that φ is the golden ratio. So maybe there are no separate assumptions. But the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's given. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7; it said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. This is confusing. However, given the instructions, I need to follow the example as best as possible. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to show that φ equals the given series. The problem is stated as: Can we show that φ = 1/2 + (11/2) * sum_{n=0}^infty [...]? The assumptions, following the example's approach, would be any conditions on the variables in the problem. However, the series is from n=0 to infinity, and the sum involves (2n)! over 5^{3n+1} (n!)^2. The problem is to show that this sum, when scaled by 11/2 and added to 1/2, equals φ. Since there's no variable here (like n in the example), maybe the assumptions are about convergence or the definition of φ. But the problem already defines φ as (1 + sqrt(5))/2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is standalone. But the format requires an Assumption section. In the example, even if the problem didn't state it, assumptions were extracted. If I follow strictly, maybe in this case, the assumption is that the series converges, but the problem is to show the value it converges to. However, the user's example didn't include convergence as an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no specific assumptions beyond the definition of φ, which is already given. So perhaps the Assumption section is empty. But the example had two assumptions. Maybe in this case, since there are no variables, the Assumption section is not applicable. However, the user's format requires it. Hmm. \n\nWait, looking back at the original problem: The user wrote \"Can we show that φ=...\" where φ is defined as (1+sqrt(5))/2. So the only assumption here is that φ is the golden ratio, which is given in the problem statement. So perhaps the assumption is that φ is defined as (1 + sqrt(5))/2. But in the example, the assumption was about the variable n. Here, there's no variable. So maybe the assumption is that φ is the golden ratio. But the problem already states that. So perhaps there's no separate assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the series converges, but since the problem is to show equality, convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, there are no assumptions. However, the format requires an Assumption section. In the example, even if the problem didn't state assumptions, they were listed. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\". But then the example added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example was incorrect. \n\nGiven this confusion, I'll proceed by listing the definition of φ as an assumption since it's given in the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is defined as (1 + √5)/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ = 1/2 + (11/2) ∑_{n=0}^∞ (2n)! / (5^{3n+1} (n!)^2).\n\nBut wait, the original problem's equation already defines φ as the golden ratio, so maybe that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. However, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption was n is an integer. So perhaps in this case, since the problem is to show the equality, the only assumption is the definition of φ. Alternatively, if there are no variables, maybe the assumption section is empty. But the format requires it. Hmm. The user might expect at least one assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, and we can write \"None\" under assumptions, but the example didn't do that. The example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's original statement. So perhaps in this case, since there are no variables, there are no assumptions. But the format requires the section. Maybe the user expects to list any conditions or properties. If there are none, perhaps state \"None\". However, in the example, even the original problem's conditions were listed as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumption is that the series converges, but that's part of what needs to be proven. Since the problem is to show that the sum equals φ, convergence would be necessary. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions here. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct approach is to list the definition of φ as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is the golden ratio, defined as (1 + √5)/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ can be expressed as 1/2 + (11/2) times the series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (2n)! / (5^{3n+1} (n!)^2).\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is \"Can we show that φ = 1/2 + ...\". So the problem is to show the equality. Therefore, the assumption is that φ is defined as (1 + √5)/2, and the problem is to show that this equals the given series. So that's the formatted version.",
