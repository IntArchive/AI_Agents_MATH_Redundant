    "Content": "An integral from MIT Integration Bee: Show that $$I = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\cos(x)\\cos(2x)\n\\cos(3x)\\,dx = \\frac\\pi2$$ This integral appeared in the 2019 paper.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "By symmetry $$\\displaystyle I = 4\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos x \\cos 2x \\cos 3x \\, \\mathrm dx.$$ Let $\\displaystyle x \\mapsto \\frac{\\pi}{2}-x$ then $$\\displaystyle I = 4\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\sin x \\cos 2x \\sin 3x \\, \\mathrm dx$$ So that if we add the two $$\\displaystyle 2I = 4\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos^2{2x} \\, \\mathrm dx = \\pi. $$ Therefore $$I = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to tackle this integral problem. The user wants to show that the integral of cos(x)cos(2x)cos(3x) from 0 to 2π equals π/2. They provided their own solution, but they think it's awkward and are looking for a more elegant approach. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some trigonometric identities that can simplify the product of cosines. Products of trigonometric functions can often be converted into sums using product-to-sum formulas. Let me remember those. The product of two cosines can be written as a sum, and maybe if there's a product of three, I can apply the identity step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering the integrand: cos(x)cos(2x)cos(3x). Maybe I can group two of the cosines first. Let's see, if I take cos(x)cos(3x), there's an identity for that. The product-to-sum formula says that cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)]/2. So applying that to cos(x)cos(3x):\n\ncos(x)cos(3x) = [cos(4x) + cos(-2x)]/2. Since cosine is even, cos(-2x) = cos(2x). So this simplifies to [cos(4x) + cos(2x)]/2.\n\nNow the integrand becomes [cos(4x) + cos(2x)]/2 * cos(2x). Let's distribute the cos(2x):\n\n= [cos(4x)cos(2x) + cos^2(2x)]/2.\n\nNow, each of these terms can be addressed. Let's apply the product-to-sum formula again to cos(4x)cos(2x):\n\ncos(4x)cos(2x) = [cos(6x) + cos(2x)]/2.\n\nSo substituting back in, the integrand becomes:\n\n[ [cos(6x) + cos(2x)]/2 + cos^2(2x) ] / 2\n\n= [cos(6x) + cos(2x) + 2cos^2(2x)] / 4.\n\nNow, the integral becomes (1/4) times the integral from 0 to 2π of [cos(6x) + cos(2x) + 2cos^2(2x)] dx.\n\nBreaking this into separate integrals:\n\n(1/4)[ ∫cos(6x) dx + ∫cos(2x) dx + 2∫cos^2(2x) dx ] evaluated from 0 to 2π.\n\nLet's compute each integral:\n\n1. ∫cos(6x) dx over 0 to 2π. The integral of cos(kx) over a full period (0 to 2π) is zero because cosine is periodic with period 2π/k, and integrating over an integer multiple of periods gives zero. So this term is zero.\n\n2. ∫cos(2x) dx over 0 to 2π. Similarly, this integral is also zero for the same reason.\n\n3. ∫cos^2(2x) dx over 0 to 2π. Use the identity cos^2(theta) = (1 + cos(2theta))/2. So:\n\n∫cos^2(2x) dx = ∫(1 + cos(4x))/2 dx from 0 to 2π.\n\nThis becomes (1/2)∫1 dx + (1/2)∫cos(4x) dx. The integral of 1 over 0 to 2π is 2π, and the integral of cos(4x) over 0 to 2π is zero. So this term is (1/2)(2π) = π.\n\nPutting it all back together:\n\n(1/4)[ 0 + 0 + 2*π ] = (1/4)(2π) = π/2.\n\nThat's the result we wanted. This method uses product-to-sum identities step by step and leverages the orthogonality of cosine functions over the interval, which seems more straightforward than the original approach. The key steps were reducing the product of three cosines into sums of single cosines and a squared cosine term, then integrating each term individually. Since the integrals of cosine terms over full periods vanish unless they are constants, only the constant term (from cos^2) contributes, leading directly to the answer.\n\nAnother approach might involve using complex exponentials, but since the user asked for elegance and the problem is from an integration bee, the product-to-sum method is likely sufficient and more straightforward for a competition setting where speed is important.",
