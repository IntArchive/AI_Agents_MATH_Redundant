    "Content": "I found the following problem in a captcha: (and I was really surprised, I expected just regular blurred or distorted text) What does that mean, and what would the solution be? EDIT: It looks, from comments and answers, that this is a consequence of Riemann Hypothesis. I would appreciate if someone could outline the proof of that fact. Cheers!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Riemann Hypothesis is arguably the most famous problem in mathematics. Its usual statement involves the zeroes of a function $\\zeta:\\mathbb C\\to\\mathbb C$ defined by $$\\zeta(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.$$ Although it looks like it's only in the world of complex numbers, it turns out to have much deeper implications in number theory and exaplaining the behavior of the prime numbers. It's an open problem, however - nobody has solved it yet. We have however proved that many things assuming it, and the statement here is one of these. The symbol $\\pi(x)$ is the prime counting function, it counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to $x$. So for instance $\\pi(6) = 3$, because of the $3$ primes $2,3,5$. I assume you understand the integral. The $O(x^{1/2+\\varepsilon})$ is just saying that the expression roughly acts like $x^{1/2+\\varepsilon}$ as $x$ grows. The problem is very hard - it's even worth a million dollars. I would go ahead and assume it's a scam or a joke.",
    "llm_answer_create_structured_problem": "###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is true, i.e., all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\\text{Re}(s) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nProblem: \nProve that the error term in the Prime Number Theorem satisfies $|\\pi(x) - \\text{Li}(x)| = O\\left(\\sqrt{x} \\log x\\right)$, where $\\pi(x)$ is the prime-counting function and $\\text{Li}(x)$ is the logarithmic integral.\n###\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe problem is a direct consequence of the Riemann Hypothesis. If the captcha referred to bounding the error in approximating $\\pi(x)$ by $\\text{Li}(x)$, the outlined proof would involve leveraging the zero-free region of $\\zeta(s)$ under RH to refine the error term in the Prime Number Theorem. A full proof requires complex analysis and analytic number theory techniques, connecting the zeros of $\\zeta(s)$ to the distribution of primes.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user found a captcha with a math problem and wants to know the solution. The question mentions that it's related to the Riemann Hypothesis, and they want an outline of the proof.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly the math problem in the captcha was. The original question says it's \"the following problem,\" but the user hasn't provided the specific equation or statement. Since they mentioned the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), it's likely that the captcha involved a result that's equivalent to or a consequence of RH. Common examples include the distribution of prime numbers, the error term in the Prime Number Theorem, or the growth rate of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line.\n\nBut without the exact problem statement, it's challenging to outline the proof. The user might have forgotten to include the specific captcha content. However, given the mention of RH, I can assume a typical problem related to it. For example, one classic result is that RH implies the Prime Number Theorem has an error term of O(x^{1/2} log x). Alternatively, it might be about the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lying on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2.\n\nAnother possibility is that the captcha presented an equation or statement that is true if and only if RH holds. For instance, there's Mertens conjecture which was disproven, but its relation to RH is notable. Or perhaps it's about the Lindelöf hypothesis, which is a consequence of RH.\n\nSince the user wants an outline of the proof that the captcha problem is a consequence of RH, I need to pick a standard result that's known to follow from RH and explain the connection. Let's go with the error term in the Prime Number Theorem. If the captcha problem was something like proving that the difference between the prime-counting function π(x) and the logarithmic integral Li(x) is bounded by a certain expression involving x^{1/2} log x, then that's a direct consequence of RH.\n\nSo, structuring the problem based on this assumption:\n\nAssumption would include the Riemann Hypothesis being true, which states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2. The problem would then be to show that under RH, the error term in the Prime Number Theorem is O(x^{1/2} log x).\n\nBut since the exact problem isn't given, I need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, if the captcha was a specific equation or statement, like \"Prove that all non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on Re(s)=1/2,\" then the problem is the statement of RH itself. But the user says it's a consequence, so it's more likely an implication of RH, not the hypothesis itself.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes captchas use simple math problems to verify humans. But since the user was surprised and mentions RH, it's a non-trivial problem. Maybe the captcha presented an equation that requires RH to hold for it to be true, like an inequality involving sums over primes or zeta zeros.\n\nIn any case, without the exact problem, the best approach is to explain a standard consequence of RH and how it's proven. For example, the error term in the Prime Number Theorem. The assumptions would include the Riemann Hypothesis, and the problem would be to show the improved error term under that assumption.\n\nSo, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nAll non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) have real part 1/2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the error term in the Prime Number Theorem, |π(x) - Li(x)|, is O(x^{1/2} log x) under the Riemann Hypothesis.\n\nBut again, since the original captcha problem isn't specified, this is speculative. The user might need to provide more details. However, based on the information given, this seems like a plausible approach.",
