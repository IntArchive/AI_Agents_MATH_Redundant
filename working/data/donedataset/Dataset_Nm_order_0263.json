    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at the problem the user provided. The task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the problem statement should be concise.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. Their approach involves defining a series for \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} \\), then using a contradiction with the assumption that \\( s \\) (a part of the series) is rational. The key here is to extract the assumptions from the problem statement and the problem itself.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the user assumes \\( s = \\frac{p}{q} \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are natural numbers. This leads to a contradiction because the difference \\( \\frac{p}{q} - s_n \\) ends up being an integer for large \\( n \\), which isn't possible given the bounds derived. The question then asks if this can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. \\( s \\) is expressed as \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are natural numbers. This is the main assumption leading to the contradiction.\n2. The series definitions provided in the approach: \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\), and \\( s_n \\) as the partial sum up to \\( n \\).\n3. The inequality derived for \\( s - s_n \\), which is used to show the contradiction.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The key assumption leading to the contradiction is that \\( s \\) is rational. The other parts are part of the problem setup or the approach taken, not assumptions per se. The problem is to show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational using this approach.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", and the user's approach involves \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\), which is half of \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} \\). The user's assumption for contradiction is that \\( s \\) is rational. Then, through the series expansion and bounds, they reach a contradiction. However, the problem is to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, not \\( s \\). So the user is asking if their proof for \\( s \\) being irrational can be extended to \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nTherefore, the problem as stated in the original question is \"Can we somehow use this to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational?\" So, the formatted problem should capture this. The assumptions would include the user's approach steps that are necessary for the problem. But according to the example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. However, in this case, the user is presenting their own approach and asking if it can be adapted. The problem here is not just to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, but to see if their method for \\( s \\) can be used for that.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", and the question body details their approach for \\( s \\), which is related to \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} \\), and asks if this can be used to prove the irrationality of \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nSo the core problem is still to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. The user's approach involves assuming \\( s \\) is rational and getting a contradiction. But how does that relate to \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\)?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\), where \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\).\n2. If \\( s \\) were rational, then a contradiction arises as shown in the steps.\n3. The user's method leads to proving \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the actual problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. So maybe the key assumption here is that the user has proven \\( s \\) is irrational, and wants to use that to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as: given the user's approach to showing \\( s \\) is irrational, can this method be adapted to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"Can we somehow use this to prove \\( e^\\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational?\" So the problem is to use the given approach (which proved \\( s \\) is irrational) to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the steps the user took to show \\( s \\) is irrational, but according to the format, we need to list the assumptions of the problem. However, in the example provided, the assumption was about \\( n \\) being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, perhaps the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\), where \\( s \\) is the series defined as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\).\n- The user has shown that assuming \\( s \\) is rational leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut the problem is then: Can this method be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational?\n\nHowever, according to the user's example, the problem should be restated as the original problem's core. The example took the original problem's statement and structured it. So here, the original problem is \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\". The user presented their approach and asks if their method for \\( s \\) can be used for this.\n\nBut the problem as per the user's original post is the title: \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", and the question body details their approach. The actual problem to structure is the title, and the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was only stated \"for every integer \\( n \\)\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer \\( n \\), the number  \n\\( A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) \\)  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n\\( n \\) is an integer,\n\\( n \\) is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that \\( A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) \\) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer \\( n \\)\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions that n is integer and n divisible by 7. But this seems like the user might have made a mistake in the example, because the original problem doesn't have the divisibility by 7 as a condition. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong, but according to the user's instruction, the example is how they want the answer to be structured.\n\nBut in any case, following the user's example, the formatted problem's assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. However, in the current problem, the original question's problem is to \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\". The user's approach introduces \\( s \\) and shows it's irrational, then asks if this can be used to prove the main problem. But the core problem is still to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. Therefore, the assumptions would be any conditions given, but since the problem is standalone, there might not be explicit assumptions except those inherent in the problem. However, perhaps the key is to extract the necessary assumptions from the user's approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem as presented in the question doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definitions, but the user's method involves certain steps which can be considered as part of the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to use the given approach (assuming s is rational and getting a contradiction) to prove e^sqrt2 is irrational. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\)\n- \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\)\n- Assuming \\( s \\) is rational leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n\\( s \\) is defined as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n\\( s \\) is assumed to be rational (i.e., \\( s = \\frac{p}{q} \\) for \\( p, q \\in \\mathbb{N} \\)),\nThe inequality derived for \\( s - s_n \\) leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut the problem is to show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational using this method.\n\nBut the original problem is to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. The user's method shows that \\( s \\) is irrational and asks if this can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. Therefore, the problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, using the fact that \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: Using the given approach that shows \\( s \\) is irrational, prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is restated as the original problem's core, with assumptions listed. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nThen the problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the user hasn't proven \\( s \\) is irrational yet; their approach is to prove \\( s \\) is irrational and then use that to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. However, in their question, they showed a contradiction assuming \\( s \\) is rational, hence proving \\( s \\) is irrational, and then asks if this can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include that \\( s \\) is irrational (as established by their proof), and the relationship between \\( s \\) and \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's conditions, not the solution's steps. Therefore, perhaps the problem here is: Given that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\) and \\( s \\) is irrational, prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the user's question is whether their proof of \\( s \\)'s irrationality can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\)'s irrationality. So the problem is: Can the irrationality of \\( s \\) imply the irrationality of \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), and if so, how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem as per the original title is to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, and the user's approach is part of their attempt. Therefore, the problem is still \"Prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational,\" with the assumptions being the setup in the question.\n\nHowever, the example given by the user includes an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the divisibility by 7). That suggests that perhaps in the example, the user incorrectly added an assumption. But following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original question, which may include implicit conditions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is defined as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational (as shown by the contradiction in the approach).\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the user hasn't proven \\( s \\) is irrational yet in the problem statement; they showed that assuming \\( s \\) is rational leads to a contradiction, hence \\( s \\) is irrational. Then they ask if this can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nSo the problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational using the fact that \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, if we follow the example where assumptions are conditions given in the problem, but the original problem here doesn't state those conditions explicitly, perhaps we need to list the mathematical definitions as assumptions. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That might suggest that the example is flawed, but the user wants us to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to list all the mathematical conditions and definitions given in the problem as assumptions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s - s_n \\) is bounded by the given inequality,\n- Assuming \\( s = \\frac{p}{q} \\) for integers \\( p, q \\), leads to a contradiction showing \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nCan this approach be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be restated as the core problem, which is \"Prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps the assumptions are the mathematical relationships presented in the problem statement, such as the series expansions and the bounds derived.\n\nHowever, the example's format seems to list the conditions that the problem imposes, not the solution's steps. Therefore, in the current problem, the core problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, and the assumptions are the mathematical definitions given in the approach, like the series expression for \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nBut I need to structure it as per the example. The example took the original problem, which was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, and formatted it with assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake in the example. However, the user provided it, so perhaps they want us to follow that structure even if it's not accurate.\n\nIn that case, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is expressed in terms of \\( s \\) via the equation \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is defined as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- Assuming \\( s \\) is rational leads to a contradiction.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the problem here is that the original question is asking if the method used to prove \\( s \\) is irrational can be adapted to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. So the problem is not just to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, but to determine if their specific approach for \\( s \\) can be extended.\n\nHowever, the example provided by the user took the original problem's core and listed assumptions, even if they were not explicitly stated. So perhaps in this case, the problem is as per the title: \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", and the assumptions are the mathematical steps presented in the question, broken down into individual points.\n\nBut according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking down the problem:\n\nThe user defines \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\), which is part of the series expansion of \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} \\). Then they define \\( s_n \\) as the partial sum up to n. They derive an inequality for \\( s - s_n \\), assume \\( s \\) is rational, and reach a contradiction. Then they ask if this can be used to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed for the problem would be the mathematical relationships and conditions presented:\n\n1. \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\).\n2. \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\).\n3. The difference \\( s - s_n \\) satisfies the given inequality.\n4. Assuming \\( s \\) is rational leads to a contradiction, implying \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the problem is to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational. However, the user's question is whether their proof for \\( s \\) can be used for \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\). Therefore, the problem is not just to prove \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational, but to do so using their approach.\n\nBut the example structured the problem by restating the core problem with relevant assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", with the assumptions being the key steps in the user's approach that are necessary for the proof.\n\nAlternatively, given the ambiguity, perhaps the best way is to list the assumptions as the key mathematical conditions presented in the problem statement, each as a separate line, and the problem as the core question.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumptions:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- The remainder \\( s - s_n \\) is bounded by \\( \\frac{2^{n+1}}{(2n+2)!} \\frac{(2n+3)^2}{(2n+3)^2 - 2} \\),\n- Assuming \\( s = \\frac{p}{q} \\) for integers \\( p, q \\) leads to a contradiction.\n\nProblem:\nCan this method be used to prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational?\n\nBut the example's problem was restated as the original problem's core, not the question asked in the body. The original title is \"Show that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational\", and the body asks if their approach can be used. However, according to the user's example, the formatted problem should be the core problem, not the meta-question about the method.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is defined as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut this assumes that s being irrational is given, but in reality, the user proved s is irrational and wants to use that. Therefore, the problem is to use the irrationality of s to prove e^sqrt2 is irrational.\n\nBut how to structure that? The example didn't have such a dependency. Given the example may have been incorrect, but following it, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions presented in the problem, and the problem is the title.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is expressed as \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2s - e^{-\\sqrt{2}}} \\),\n- \\( s = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^k}{(2k)!} \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut this is not accurate. The user's approach doesn't express e^sqrt2 in terms of s like that. Instead, they have e^sqrt2 + e^{-sqrt2} = 2s. So if s is irrational, then e^sqrt2 + e^{-sqrt2} is irrational. The question is, does that imply e^sqrt2 is irrational?\n\nThus, the problem is: Given that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\) and \\( s \\) is irrational, prove that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut the user's question is whether their proof of s's irrationality can be used to prove e^sqrt2's irrationality. Therefore, the problem is to show that if \\( s \\) is irrational, then \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user has already shown \\( s \\) is irrational. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the relationship between \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) and \\( s \\), then the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nThis seems plausible. Because if you know that \\( 2s \\) is irrational and you have a relation involving \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\), you might need to use that to show \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nBut how? For example, suppose \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) were rational. Then \\( e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 1/e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) would also be rational, so their sum \\( 2s \\) would be rational, implying \\( s \\) is rational, contradicting the assumption that \\( s \\) is irrational. Therefore, the irrationality of \\( s \\) implies the irrationality of \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s \\),\n- \\( s \\) is irrational.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) is irrational.\n\nThis seems like the correct structure. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object: the equation relating \\( e^{\\sqrt{2}} \\) and \\( s \\), and the irrationality of \\( s \\).\n\nThus, the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\n$e^{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{-\\sqrt{2}} = 2s$,\n$s$ is irrational.\nProblem:\nProve that $e^{\\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational.\n###",
