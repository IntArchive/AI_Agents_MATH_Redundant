    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any $a \\ge 1$, let $f_n(a)$ be the expression $$f_n(a) \\stackrel{def}{=}\\frac{(a+a^{-1})(\\phi^{n-1/2} + \\phi^{1/2-n})}{a^2 + a^{-2} - 1 + \\phi^{2n-1} + \\phi^{1-2n}}$$ The sums at hand equal to $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\tan^{-1}f_n(e)$ and $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty \\tan^{-1}f_n(\\gamma^{-1})$ respectively. For any $n \\ge 0$, let $p_n = \\phi^{n-1/2} - \\phi^{1/2-n}$. It is easy to verify $p_{n+1} - p_{n-1} = (\\phi - \\phi^{-1})(\\phi^{n-1/2} + \\phi^{1/2-n}) = \\phi^{n-1/2} + \\phi^{1/2-n}$ $p_{n+1} p_{n-1} = (\\phi^{n+1/2} - \\phi^{-1/2-n})(\\phi^{n-3/2} - \\phi^{3/2-n})\n= \\phi^{2n-1} + \\phi^{1-2n} - 3$ Let $u = a + a^{-1}$. Notice $$\\frac{\\frac{u}{p_{n-1}} - \\frac{u}{p_{n+1}}}{\n1 + \\frac{u}{p_{n-1}} \\frac{u}{p_{n+1}}\n}\n= \\frac{u(p_{n+1}-p_{n-1})}{u^2 + p_{n+1}p_{n-1}}\n= \\frac{(a+a^{-1})(\\phi_{n-1/2} + \\phi_{1/2-n})}{a^2 + a^{-2} - 1 + \\phi^{2n-1} + \\phi^{1-2n}} = f_n(a)\n$$\nThere exists integers $N_n$ such that\n$$\\tan^{-1} f_n(a) = \\tan^{-1}\n\\left(\\frac{\\frac{u}{p_{n-1}} - \\frac{u}{p_{n+1}}}{\n1 + \\frac{u}{p_{n-1}} \\frac{u}{p_{n+1}}\n}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{n-1}} - \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{n+1}}\n+ N_n \\pi\n$$ When $n > 1$, $p_{n+1} > p_{n-1} > 0$, it is easy to see $N_n = 0$. When $n = 1$, we have\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(a), \\frac{u}{p_2} > 0\\\\\n\\frac{u}{p_0} < 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\\implies\\quad\n\\begin{cases}\n\\tan^{-1}f_1(a), \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_2} \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\\\\n\\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_0} \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2},0)\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\\implies\\quad\nN_1 = 1\n$$\nThis implies\n$$\\begin{align}\n  & \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\tan^{-1}f_n(a)\\\\\n= & \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\left( \\tan^{-1}f_{2m-1}(a) + \\tan^{-1}f_{2m}(a)\\right)\\\\\n= & \\pi + \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^N\\left[\\left( \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2m-2}} - \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2m}}\\right) + \\left( \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2m-1}} - \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2m+1}}\\right)\\right]\\\\\n= & \\pi + \\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\n\\left[\n\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_0} + \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_1}\\right)\n-\n\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2N}} + \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_{2N+1}}\\right)\n\\right]\\\\\n= & \\pi + \\left(\\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_0} + \\tan^{-1}\\frac{u}{p_1}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$\nNotice $p_0 = -p_1$, the last bracket vanishes. As a result,\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\tan^{-1}f_n(a) = \\pi\\quad\\text{ for all } a \\ge 1$$ As pointed out by @Winther, we can relax the condition from $a \\ge 1$ to $a > 0$. This is because for $a \\in (0,1)$, $f_n(a) = f_n(a^{-1})$. We can generalize this a little bit. Let $g_n(u)$ be the expression $$g_n(u) \\stackrel{def}{=} \\frac{u(\\phi^{n-1/2} + \\phi^{1/2-n})}{\nu^2 + (\\phi^{n-1/2} + \\phi^{1/2-n})^2 - 5}$$ We have $f_n(a) = g_n(a + a^{-1})$. If we adopt the convention that $\\tan^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right]$, i.e $\\tan^{-1}\\infty = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\tan^{-1}x < 0$ for $x < 0$, we have $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\tan^{-1}g_n(u) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\pi, & u_c \\le u\\\\\n0, & 0 < u < u_c\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\\text{ where }\\quad u_c = \\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{5}}\n$$ For all $u > 0$, the analysis is essentially the same as above. When $u < u_c$, there is one place we need to adjust the argument. Namely, $g_1(u)$ becomes $-ve$\nand this forces the corresponding $N_1$ to vanish. At the end, when $u < u_c$, this causes the $\\pi$ term disappear from above sum.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to structure the given problem into the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem clearly. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Prove $A=B=\\pi$\". Then, the question defines two constants: γ (Euler-Mascheroni constant) as approximately 0.57721566..., and φ (golden ratio) as (1+√5)/2. \n\nNext, there are two infinite sums defined, A and B. Each sum is an infinite series of arctangent terms. The structure for A is:\n\nA = sum_{n=1}^∞ arctan[ (e + e^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) / (e² + e^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ]\n\nSimilarly for B, replacing e and e^{-1} with γ and γ^{-1} respectively. The problem statement (1) claims that both A and B equal π, and they found this accidentally while searching for π in terms of arctan(x), with ideas from Dr. Ron Knott's Fibonacci site. The user is asking for a proof of (1).\n\nNow, the task is to structure this problem into the given format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem is restated.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key elements are:\n\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.577...)\n- φ is the golden ratio ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )\n- A and B are infinite sums of arctan terms with specific expressions involving e, γ, and φ.\n- The claim is that both A and B equal π.\n\nAssumptions here would be the definitions of the constants and the structure of the sums. However, the example given in the user's instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. But in this current problem, the original question doesn't state explicit assumptions except the definitions of γ, φ, and the forms of A and B. The problem is to prove that both sums equal π.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include the definitions of the constants and the structure of the series. Each assumption should be one line, one property per line. Let's parse:\n\n1. γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (given as 0.5772...)\n2. φ is the golden ratio, defined as (1 + √5)/2\n3. A is an infinite sum from n=1 to ∞ of arctan of a specific expression involving e and φ.\n4. Similarly, B is the same structure but with γ instead of e.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the definitions of A and B are given explicitly. So, each of those definitions would be assumptions. However, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", so maybe here the assumptions would be the definitions of the constants and the structure of the sums.\n\nBut the problem is to prove A = B = π. So, the assumptions are the given definitions. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.57721566...),\nφ is the golden ratio, defined as (1 + √5)/2,\nA is defined as the infinite sum from n=1 to ∞ of arctan[( (e + e^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (e² + e^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ],\nB is defined as the infinite sum from n=1 to ∞ of arctan[( (γ + γ^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (γ² + γ^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ]\n\nBut each assumption must address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking each into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nφ is the golden ratio defined as (1 + √5)/2,\nA is an infinite sum over n starting from 1 to ∞,\nEach term of A is arctan[( (e + e^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (e² + e^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ],\nB is an infinite sum over n starting from 1 to ∞,\nEach term of B is arctan[( (γ + γ^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (γ² + γ^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ]\n\nWait, but the example given in the user's instruction had more concise assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, and then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The user structured it as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the current problem, there are no such conditions on n except that it's a summation index. The problem is about proving the sum equals π. So the key assumptions are the definitions of γ, φ, A, and B. Each of these should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nBut maybe the problem's key point is that the sum telescopes or relates to a known series for π. The user mentions that the idea comes from Dr. Ron Knott's Fibonacci site, which might involve properties of the golden ratio and arctangent terms. But as per the problem structure, we just need to state the assumptions and the problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- φ is the golden ratio, defined as (1 + √5)/2.\n- A is defined as the given infinite sum involving e and φ.\n- B is defined as the given infinite sum involving γ and φ.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, the original problem statement defines A and B with their respective formulas. So each formula is part of the assumption. Since each assumption is supposed to address one property applied to one object, then the definitions of A and B each count as one assumption. Similarly, the definitions of γ and φ.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (approximately 0.57721566...),\nφ is the golden ratio defined as (1 + √5)/2,\nA is the infinite sum from n=1 to ∞ of arctan[ ((e + e^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2})) / (e² + e^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ],\nB is the infinite sum from n=1 to ∞ of arctan[ ((γ + γ^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) / (γ² + γ^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ]\n\nProblem:\nProve that A = B = π.\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is one line, one property per object. For example, the definition of A is a single assumption. Similarly for B. The constants γ and φ are each their own assumptions. So, that's four assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user included two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the definitions of A and B are two separate assumptions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n2. φ is the golden ratio, defined as (1 + √5)/2.\n3. A is defined as the given sum involving e and φ.\n4. B is defined as the given sum involving γ and φ.\n\nBut each of these is a separate line. Then, the problem is to prove A = B = π.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nφ is the golden ratio defined as (1 + √5)/2,\nA is defined as ∑_{n=1}^∞ arctan[ ( (e + e^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (e² + e^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ],\nB is defined as ∑_{n=1}^∞ arctan[ ( (γ + γ^{-1})(φ^{(2n-1)/2} + φ^{(1-2n)/2}) ) / (γ² + γ^{-2} -1 + φ^{2n-1} + φ^{1-2n}) ]\n\nProblem:\nProve that A = B = π.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key is that each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. The problem is to prove the equality to π. The original problem mentions that this was found accidentally while searching for π in terms of arctan, but the user wants the problem restructured without that extra info, just the assumptions and the problem.",
