    "Content": "I've got an example for this question, but there are many different possibilites and I don't know how to show this for all graphs.\nHas got anyone any advice how to begin ? Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph.\nThen there is a partition $V = V_1 \\cup  V_2$ of its vertex set such that all vertices in $G[V_1]$ and $G[V_2]$ have even degrees. I draw it on paper, but how mentioned it, it's not proven for all and I don't know how.\nThank you for any advice.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We approach this problem via induction on the number of vertices, $|V|$ .  Trivially, the claim is true when $|V|\\leq 3$ . Assume for our induction hypothesis that all graphs on strictly fewer than $n$ vertices satisfies the claim that there exists some partition into two sets of vertices where the induced subgraph on each is such that every vertex is of even degree.  Consider then what happens for arbitrary $G$ when $|V(G)|=n$ . We may assume that $G$ contains at least one vertex of odd degree (if not, then take $V_1 = V$ and $V_2 = \\emptyset$ , trivially satisfying the claim).  Pick one such vertex of odd degree and label it $v$ .  Take note of the neighborhood of $v$ and label it $\\mathscr{N}(v)$ . Construct a new graph from the original defined as: $G' = (V(G)\\backslash\\{v\\}, \\{(x,y):~x\\neq y, (x,y)\\in E(G\\backslash \\mathscr{N}(v))\\cup (E(\\mathscr{N}(v)))^c\\})$ That is to say, to form $G'$ , invert the adjacency relationships between members of $\\mathscr{N}(v)$ , delete $v$ , and retain the rest of the graph the way it was in $G$ . Now, $G'$ has fewer vertices than $G$ and by our induction hypothesis has some partition $V_1', V_2'$ such that all vertices in the induced subgraphs from $G'$ are of even degree. Define $A = V_1'\\cap \\mathscr{N}(v)$ and define $B = V_2'\\cap \\mathscr{N}(v)$ As $v$ was selected to be of odd degree, precisely one of $|A|$ or $|B|$ will be of even size.  Without loss of generality, assume it was $A$ . Returning now to the original graph, consider the partition $V_1 = V_1'\\cup\\{v\\}$ and $V_2 = V_2'~~~~~$ (note, if it had been $B$ which was of even size, attach $\\{v\\}$ to $V_2$ instead) Note that for any vertex $x\\in V_i\\backslash\\mathscr{N}(v)$ , the adjacencies are the same as in the induced subgraph from $G'$ of $V_i'$ , and is therefore of even degree. For any vertex in $A$ , It will have the same number of adjacencies to elements outside of $A$ as in the induced subgraph from $G'$ of $V_1'$ (either odd or even $\\star$ ), and will have $|A\\backslash\\{x\\}|$ minus the number of adjacencies to other elements of $A$ while in $G'$ (odd if $\\star$ was odd, even otherwise), plus 1 for the adjacency to $v$ .  I.e., $d_{G(V_1)}(x) = d_{G'(V_1')}(x) + |A|-1-d_{G'(A')}(x)+1$ (which is even + even - 1 - even + 1 or it is odd + even - 1 - odd + 1) and is therefore of even degree. For any vertex $x\\in B$ , as $|B|$ was assumed to be odd, it will similarly be $d_{G(V_2)}(x) = d_{G'(V_2')}(x) + |B|-1 -d_{G'(B')}(x)$ (which is even + odd - 1 - even or it is odd + odd - 1 - odd) and is also of even degree. For $v$ itself, its only adjacencies are to $A$ , which was assumed to be of even size, and so $d(v)=|A|$ is even. Therefore, all vertices are of even degree in their respective induced subgraphs and the claim is proven.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that for any undirected graph, there exists a partition of the vertex set into two subsets such that all vertices in each induced subgraph have even degrees.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that G is an undirected graph. The user mentions a partition V = V1 ∪ V2, and the requirement is that in both induced subgraphs G[V1] and G[V2], every vertex has even degree. \n\nWait, the original problem doesn't specify any additional constraints beyond G being undirected. So the main assumption is just that G is an undirected graph. The example given in the user's example included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the only assumption is the graph being undirected. However, the problem might implicitly rely on properties of undirected graphs, like the handshake theorem, but those aren't stated as assumptions. The user just needs to list explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumption here is simply that G is an undirected graph. The problem is to show there exists a partition V1 and V2 such that in both induced subgraphs, all vertices have even degree. \n\nWait, the problem statement in the original question is a bit more precise. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"Prove there always exists a partition such that vertices in each part have even degree.\" The problem is about partitioning the vertex set so that in each part (V1 and V2), every vertex in G[V1] and G[V2] has even degree. The key here is that the induced subgraphs have all vertices with even degrees.\n\nSo, the assumption is only that G is an undirected graph. The problem is to prove the existence of such a partition. The example the user gave earlier had two assumptions, but here, there's only one explicit assumption: the graph is undirected. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as the assumption and state the problem accordingly.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user didn't mention anything about connectivity, multiple edges, loops, etc. So the problem is general for any undirected graph, regardless of other properties. Hence, the only assumption is that G is an undirected graph.",
