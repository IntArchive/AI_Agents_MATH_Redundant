The fact that it looks like $A + B + AB$ makes me curious though. Edit: Applying the comment fixes to the method I tried before posting here actually solves the problem. Recall Jacobi's formula, namely\n\\begin{align*}\n \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^3 = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k(2k+1)q^{k(k+1)/2}.\n\\end{align*}\nLooking modulo 2, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^3\\right]^8 \\equiv \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^{24} (\\bmod\\ 2),\n\\end{align*}\nand so we can look at the coefficients of\n\\begin{align*}\n \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k(2k+1)q^{k(k+1)/2}\\right]^8\n\\end{align*}\nto see where the odd coefficients lie. To this end, notice\n\\begin{align*}\n \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k(2k+1)q^{k(k+1)/2}\\right]^8 \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^{4k(k+1)} (\\bmod\\ 2)\n\\end{align*}\nand so\n\\begin{align*}\n q\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^{24} &\\equiv q\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^kq^{k(k+1)/2}\\right]^8\\newline\n  &\\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^{4k(k+1)+1}\\newline\n  &\\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^{4k^2 + 4k + 1}\\newline\n  &\\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q^{(2k+1)^2} (\\bmod\\ 2).\n\\end{align*}\nAs $k\\geq 0$ it is clear each term in the sum is distinct (i.e., we don't have problems modulo 2), hence the only non-zero coefficients modulo two (i.e., the odd ones) are the coefficients $2k+1$ for some non-negative integer $k$. In case anyone makes it further than the massive chunk of equations above, I'm still interested in seeing if that method pans out, as I remember dealing with equations of the form $A + B + AB$ before, and really expect a solution that way, though my memory is faint, so I could just be crazy. Of course I'm quite happy with the simple version either way.

We've got all the odd numbers congruent to 1 and 5 mod 6, but I don't see how we can get the numbers congruent to 3 mod 6... which makes me think there's an error I cannot find somewhere. I should add, I do (vaguely) know of another way to solve this problem, I just enjoyed this approach, so wanted to make it work if possible. Thanks!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking to prove that the Ramanujan tau function τ(n) is odd if and only if n is a square of an odd integer, i.e., n = (2m+1)^2 for some m. \n\nFirst, looking at the problem statement: the definition given is that q times the product of (1 - q^n)^24 from n=1 to infinity equals the sum of τ(n)q^n from n=1 to infinity. So, the generating function for τ(n) is this product. The goal is to show that τ(n) is odd exactly when n is an odd square.\n\nThe user attempted two approaches, one using Euler's pentagonal number theorem and another using Jacobi's formula. The first approach led to complications, while the second one using Jacobi's formula modulo 2 seemed to work. In the corrected version, they mention that modulo 2, the product (1 - q^n)^24 can be related to the eighth power of Jacobi's formula, which involves a sum involving terms q^{k(k+1)/2} raised to the eighth power. This simplifies modulo 2 to a sum of q^{(2k+1)^2}, implying that the coefficients (which are τ(n)) are odd only when n is an odd square.\n\nNow, to structure the problem as per the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n1. τ(n) is defined by the generating function q∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - q^n)^{24} = ∑_{n=1}^∞ τ(n) q^n.\n2. The problem is to be considered modulo 2 (since we are concerned with τ(n) being odd).\n3. Using Jacobi's identity modulo 2, which relates the product (1 - q^n)^3 to a sum involving terms q^{k(k+1)/2}.\n4. The eighth power of Jacobi's formula modulo 2 simplifies the expression.\n5. The resulting generating function modulo 2 is a sum of terms q^{(2k+1)^2}, implying τ(n) is odd exactly when n is an odd square.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user might have made corrections based on comments, so the main assumptions are the definition of τ(n) and the properties used in the proof, like Jacobi's formula. However, in the problem as posed, the user is asking to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the given definitions and properties needed.\n\nHowever, the problem itself is to prove the if and only if condition for τ(n) being odd. So the assumptions should list the definitions and any given conditions. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"Define τ(n) by\n  \\begin{align*}\n   q\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^{24} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\tau(n)q^n.\n  \\end{align*}\n  Prove that τ(n) is odd if and only if n = (2m+1)^2 for some m.\"\n\nSo the only explicit assumption is the definition of τ(n). The rest are steps in the attempted proof. However, in the example provided in the user's initial message, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is the definition of τ(n) via that generating function. The problem is to prove the equivalence regarding τ(n)'s parity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that τ(n) is defined as per the generating function, and the problem is to prove the oddness condition. However, in the example, assumptions also included properties of the variable (n is integer). Here, n is a positive integer since it's in the sum from n=1 to infinity. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- τ(n) is defined by the generating function \\( q\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)^{24} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\tau(n) q^n \\).\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that τ(n) is odd if and only if n is the square of an odd integer, i.e., n = (2m + 1)^2 for some non-negative integer m.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions \"for some m\" without specifying non-negative, but since n is a positive integer, m should be non-negative. However, in the problem statement, the exact phrasing is \"n = (2m+1)^2 for some m\". So perhaps the assumption is just the definition and n being a positive integer. Alternatively, maybe the user's own initial assumptions in the problem include working modulo 2, but that's part of the proof steps, not the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about τ(n) being odd, so the parity is part of the problem's statement. The key given condition is the generating function. So the assumptions are:\n\n- τ(n) is defined by the given generating function.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
