    "Content": "I want to prove that the antipodal map from $S^n$ to $S^n$ is homotopic to the identity map if $n$ is odd. (I know it's actually true if and only if) If I consider the map $ H(x,t) = (1-2t)x $, why doesn't this work? I don't really see how this  is any different if $n$ is odd or even. Is it continuous? Again, I don't see why it isn't Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Henning or Rasmus have explained to you, $H(x,t) = (1-2t)x$ fails to land within $S^n$ for $t\\neq 0,1$. The usual trick to arrange that, namely redefine $$\nH(x,t) = \\dfrac{(1-2t)x}{\\| (1-2t)x \\|}  \\ ,\n$$ doesn't work either because this new $H$ is not continuous for $t= \\frac{1}{2}$. If you want an specific homotopy from $\\mathrm{id}_{S^{2n-1}}$ to $-\\mathrm{id}_{S^{2n-1}}$, here is one. Let's start with $n=1$. Let's think $S^1$ as the set of complex numbers $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ of modulus 1: $\\vert z \\vert = 1$. Consider the map: $$\nH: S^1 \\times I \\longrightarrow S^1\n$$ defined by $$\nH(z,t) = e^{i\\pi t} z \\ .\n$$ This map is plainly continuous, its image lies on the sphere $\\vert H(z,t) \\vert = \\vert e^{i\\pi t}\\vert \\cdot \\vert z \\vert = \\vert z \\vert = 1$ and $H(z,0) = z$ and $H(z,1) = -z$. Hence, it may be the homotopy you were looking for, right? For $n \\geq 1$, exactly the same map works. Now you think your odd sphere $S^{2n-1}$ as being the subset of complex $n$-tuples $z = (z_1, \\dots , z_n) \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$ of modulus 1, $\\vert z \\vert = \\sqrt{\\vert z_1\\vert^2 + \\dots + \\vert z_n\\vert^2 } = 1$. And you consider the same map: $$\nH: S^{2n-1} \\times I \\longrightarrow S^{2n-1} \\ .\n$$ Namely, $$\nH(z,t) = e^{i\\pi t} z = (e^{i\\pi t} z_1 , \\dots ,e^{i\\pi t} z_n ) \\ .\n$$ The same proof we did for $n=1$ applies now and shows that $H$ is the desired homotopy. Notice that, since we had to rely on complex numbers, this does not work for even spheres. Finally, if you prefer, another way to write the map $H$ for $n=1$, now thinking $S^1$ as the set of points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\\| (x,y) \\| = 1$, could be $$\nH(x,y,t) = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos (\\pi t)  &  -\\sin (\\pi t) \\\\\n\\sin (\\pi t)  &  \\cos (\\pi t)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix}  \\ .\n$$ That is, we are rotating $(x,y)$ more and more, as $t$ increases, till we arrive at $(-x,-y)$. Notice that you need to be in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to do this: you couldn't rotate anything if we were talking about the \"even\" sphere $S^0 = \\left\\{ -1, +1\\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and clearly there is no homotopy from $\\mathrm{id}_{S^0}$ to $-\\mathrm{id}_{S^0}$; that is, a path inside $S^0$, joining $-1$ and $+1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the antipodal map on S^n is homotopic to the identity map when n is odd. They mentioned trying the homotopy H(x, t) = (1 - 2t)x and are confused why it doesn't work, and why the parity of n matters.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the antipodal map is. It's the map that sends each point x on the sphere to its opposite point -x. A homotopy between two maps requires a continuous deformation from one to the other. The user's proposed homotopy H(x, t) = (1 - 2t)x seems like it's linearly interpolating between x (when t=0) and -x (when t=1). But wait, for this to be a valid homotopy on the sphere, the intermediate steps (for t between 0 and 1) must also lie on the sphere. However, if we take a point x on S^n, then (1 - 2t)x is only on the sphere if |1 - 2t| = 1. That occurs only when t=0 or t=1. For other t values, the point (1 - 2t)x would be either inside or outside the sphere, not on it. So this H doesn't actually stay within S^n, making it invalid as a homotopy of maps S^n → S^n.\n\nTherefore, the user's homotopy doesn't work because it doesn't preserve the sphere's points during the deformation. But then why does the problem state that such a homotopy exists when n is odd? There must be another approach when n is odd that respects the sphere's constraints.\n\nMaybe when n is odd, there's a way to rotate the sphere gradually from the identity to the antipodal map without passing through points off the sphere. For even-dimensional spheres, such a rotation might require passing through a point that's fixed, leading to a problem, but when n is odd, each point can be rotated in a way that avoids fixed points. For example, in S^1 (a circle, which is 1-dimensional and odd), rotating each point by π radians over time would work. But in S^2 (even), the antipodal map has degree -1, while the identity has degree 1. The homotopy between them would require their degrees to be equal, which they aren't if the dimension is even. However, when n is odd, the degree of the antipodal map is 1 (since it's a composition of an odd number of reflections, each contributing a sign, so (-1)^{n+1} when n is odd gives +1), matching the identity's degree, allowing them to be homotopic.\n\nSo the key is that when n is odd, the antipodal map has the same degree as the identity, which is necessary for them to be homotopic. The user's proposed homotopy isn't valid because it leaves the sphere, but a different homotopy using rotations (perhaps via a path in SO(n+1)) would work when n is odd. For even n, such a path doesn't exist because the degrees differ.",
