    "Content": "I'm trying to prove a special case of Vishik's Normal Form. Consider $T^2 := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\mathbb{T}^2 \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$ , let $h: \\mathbb{\\mathbb{S}^3}\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the function $h(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = x_1^2+x_2^2 -\\frac{1}{2}$ , and $\\mathbb{S}^+ :=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^3; h(x)\\geq 0\\}$ . We say that $X$ is a vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$ if $$X:\\mathbb{S}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R^4} $$ is a smooth function and $X(p)$ $\\in$ $T_p\\mathbb{S^3} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4$ , $\\forall p \\in \\mathbb{S}^+$ . For our purposes we will always consider $X(p) \\neq 0$ , $\\ \\forall \\ p \\in T^2$ . Notations: $Xh(p)= \\nabla h(p) \\cdot X(p)$ and $X^2 h(p)= \\nabla Xh(p) \\cdot X(p).$ Definition: Let $X$ be a vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$ and $p$ $\\in$ $T^2$ . If $Xh(p) = 0$ and $X^2 h(p) \\neq 0$ , $p$ is called a fold point. The theorem that I am trying to demonstrate is as follows: Theorem (Vishik's Normal Form) Let $X$ be a vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$ such that, all the points on $T^2$ that satisfy $Xh(q) =0$ are fold points. Then, if $p$ $\\in T^2$ is a fold point, there exists an open set $V_p \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$ and a local chart $\\varphi: V_p \\to U_0 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ $(\\varphi(p) = 0)$ such that $\\varphi_*X|_{\\varphi(V_p)}$ is a germ at $\\{0\\}\\times \\mathbb{R}^2 \\cap \\varphi (V_p)$ of the vector field given by: $$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\dot{x}_1=\\varepsilon x_2,\\\\\n\\dot{x}_2=1,\\\\\n\\dot{x}_3=0. \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.$$ Where $\\varepsilon =\\text{sgn}(X^2 h(p))$ and $\\varphi^{-1}(\\{0\\}\\times \\mathbb{R}^2 \\cap \\varphi (V_p) )= V_p\\cap T^2$ . I do not have many ideas of how to prove this theorem and I do not know any good reference. Does anyone know how to prove this theorem or can give me some hints (or references)? My ideas Note that $h$ is a function such that $0$ is regular value, then using local submersion theorem there exists a local coordinate system $\\phi: V_0 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to U_p \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$ ( $\\phi(0) = p$ ), such that $h \\circ \\phi (x,y,z) = x$ . Defining $Y(q) = D\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(q)) \\cdot X(\\phi(q))$ , we are able to study the problem in an open neighborhood of $0$ in the topological space $\\mathbb{H}^3 = \\{(x,y,z); 0\\leq x\\}$ , with some calculation is possible to show that if $f=h\\circ \\phi$ , then $Y f(q) = Y_1(q)$ (where $Y=(Y_1,Y_2,Y_3))$ , implying by the definition of $X$ , that $Yf(0) =0$ and $Y^2 f(0) = Y(0) \\cdot \\nabla Y_1(0) \\neq 0$ . Once $Yf(0,0,0) =0$ and, by hypotesis, $0\\neq Y^2 f(0,0,0) = Y(0,0,0) \\cdot \\nabla Y_1(0,0,0)$ , we are able to conclude that either $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} Y_1(0,0,0) \\neq 0\\  \\text{or} \\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} Y_1(0,0,0) \\neq 0,$$ assuming without loss of generality $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} Y_1(0,0,0)\\neq 0$ , and using implicit function theorem, there exists $\\tau: (-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)^2 \\to (-\\delta,\\delta)$ , such that $Y(x,\\tau(x,z),z) =0$ . Defining the local diffeomorphism $\\psi (x,y,z) := (x,y+\\tau(x,z),z)$ we can (by changing the coordinates and and shrinking the definition domain of $Y$ ) assume that $Y = (Y_1,Y_2,Y_3)$ , with $Y_1(x,0,z) =0$ (redefining $Y$ as $\\psi^{-1}_* Y$ ). It is clear that $$\\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial y}(0)\\neq 0 \\ \\text{and}\\ \\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial x}(0)  = \\frac{\\partial Y_1}{\\partial x}(0) = 0. $$ Using this question A special change of coordiantes of a Vector Field , we can make a change of coordinates $\\zeta (x,y,z) = (x,\\pi_{(2,3)} \\circ \\varphi (y,(x,0,z) )^{-1}$ , where $\\varphi(t,z)$ is the solution of the ODE $$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\dot{x} = Y(x)\\\\\nx(0)=z,\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$ (we are able to extend $Y(x)$ to a open neighboorhood of $(0,0,0)$ ), implying that $$\\zeta_* Y(x,y,z) = \\text{d}\\zeta (\\zeta^{-1} (x)) Y(\\zeta^{-1}(x))=  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nY_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1}(x,y,z)\\\\\n1\\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)$$ Note that we still have $Y_1(\\zeta^{-1}(x,0,z)) = Y_1(x,\\pi_{(2,3)}\\circ \\varphi(0,(x,0,z)) = Y_1(x,0,z) =0,$ and consequently $$\\frac{\\partial Y_1(\\zeta^{-1})}{\\partial x}(0) = \\frac{\\partial Y_1(\\zeta^{-1})}{\\partial z}(0) =0 \\ \\text{and}\\ \\frac{\\partial Y_1(\\zeta^{-1})}{\\partial y}(0)\\neq 0.$$ The vector field is almost in the desired form, but I don't know how to proceed, any hints? Another thing that I noticed but didn't lead me to anywhere, is that we can define the local diffeomorphism $\\theta (x,y,z) = (x, Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1}(x,y,z),z)$ and we can easily check that \\begin{align*}\n\\theta_* ( \\zeta_* Y)(x,y,z) &=  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1} }{\\partial x}\\left(\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z)\\right) \\cdot  Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1} \\circ \\theta^{-1} (x,y,z) + \\frac{\\partial Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1}}{\\partial y}(\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z)) \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\\\\\n&=  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny\\\\\n\\nabla Y_1(\\zeta^{-1})(\\theta^{-1} (x,y,z)) \\cdot \\zeta_* Y (\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z)) \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\\\\\n&=  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny\\\\\n  (\\zeta_* Y)^2 \\pi_1 \\  (\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z)) \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\\\\\n&=  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny\\\\\n  (X^2 h) \\  (\\theta \\circ \\zeta \\circ \\phi )^{-1}(x,y,z)) \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align*} however $\\frac{\\partial Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1} }{\\partial x}\\left(\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z)\\right) \\cdot  Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1} \\circ \\theta^{-1} (x,y,z) + \\frac{\\partial Y_1\\circ \\zeta^{-1}}{\\partial y}(\\theta^{-1}(x,y,z))$ does not seem like a constant.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you are almost there. So, just a hint: Think on the coordinate system $\\tilde\\varphi:V_p\\to U$ satisfying $d\\tilde\\varphi(X)=(0,1,0)$ . If you replace the first coordinate by the function $h$ , you get something whose first jets at $p$ is $(ax_2,1,0)$ , $a=X^2h(p)$ . It shouldn't be hard to proceed from here. The geometric meaning of the situation is that $h$ is the coordinate normal to the Torus. So, if you go in the direction of $X$ , you start escaping slowly, with starting escaping velocity 0, but accelerating. Note that $Xh(p)=0$ just mean that $X$ is tangent to the torus; $X^2h(p)\\neq 0$ means it is trying to escape. ERRATA v.21.10.2018 (changing the construction from $\\{0\\}\\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\{x\\}\\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ ) Actually, the diffeomorphism I suggested does not send $T^2\\cap V_p$ to $\\{0\\}{\\times} \\mathbb R^2$ , but the greatest issue is still the first coordinate. Let us think on the other way around: Note that $V_p$ can be thought as a a neighborhood $U'\\subset \\mathbb R^3$ (up to diffeomorphism), where $T^2\\cap V_p$ corresponds to $U'\\cap \\{0\\}\\times\\mathbb R^2$ and the first coordinate is $h$ . Let us transpose the whole problem to $U'$ , still denoting by $X$ and $h$ their corresponding objects in $ U'$ . Decompose $X=(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ and denote $X^T=(0,X_2,X_3)$ . The function $h$ satisfies $h(T^2)=0$ , $Xh(p)=0$ and $X^2h(p)\\neq 0$ (let us assume $X^2h(p)> 0$ , for simplicity). The last inequality guarantees that $p$ is a regular point for the function $h_1=Xh$ , therefore, $C'=h_1^{-1}(0)\\cap U'$ is a regular surface transversal to $X$ and $X^T$ (you can shrink $U'$ for that). In particular, $C_x=C'\\cap h^{-1}(x)$ is a smooth family of curves on $U'$ for small $x$ . Shrinking $U'$ again, we assume both $X^Th_1$ and $X^2h$ positive on $C'$ . Let $\\psi:U'\\to U''\\subset \\mathbb R^3$ be a diffeomorphism where $h$ is the  first coordinate (thus preserving the first coordinate), $d\\psi(X^T)=(0,1,0)$ and $z\\mapsto\\psi(x,0,z)$ parametrizes $C_x$ (it exists since the flow of $X^T$ preserves the first coordinate and $C_x$ is transverse to $X^T$ ). Now let us see what we need to  change in the first coordinate. Given $(x_0,0,z_0)\\in C_x$ , $h_2=h\\circ\\psi^{-1}=first~coordinate$ satisfies $$\\psi(X)h_2(x_0,y,z+z_0)=Xh(\\psi^{-1}(x_0,y,z+z_0))\\\\=Xh(\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z_0))+yX^Th_1(\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z+z_0))+z\\frac{d}{dz}Xh(\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z+z_0))+o(x_0,y,z+z_0)\\\\=yX^Th(\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z+z_0))+o(x_0,y,z+z_0)\n$$ where $\\lim_{(y,z)\\to(0,0)}o(y,z)/|(y,z)|=0$ and $Xh(\\psi^{-1}(0,0,z_0))=\\frac{d}{dz}h(\\psi^{-1}(0,y,z+z_0))=0$ since $Xh$ vanishes identicaly on $C'$ . Now we get rid of $o(x_0,y,z+z_0)$ . We just integrate $o$ on the $\\psi(X)$ -direction and subtract the result from $h_2$ . That would give you the desired  first coordinate, and if you know how to do this integration, I highly recommend to not proceed and do it yourself, since the text gets messy. To make this integration, consider the chart $\\varphi:U'''\\to U''$ where $\\varphi(0,0,z)\\in C$ and $\\varphi(t,y,z)=c(t)$ , $ \\dot c=\\psi(X)$ . Take the function $O:U''\\to \\mathbb R$ : $$O(x,y,z)=\\int_0^{\\varphi^{-1}_1(x,y,z)} o(\\varphi(t,\\varphi^{-1}_2(x,y,z),\\varphi^{-1}_3(x,y,z)))dt.$$ If nothing went wrong, $\\psi(X)(h_2-O)=\\psi(X)h_2-o$ , as desired. Completing the proof: Consider the coordinate chart $\\tilde \\psi:U'\\to V'$ that you get by replacing the first coordinate by $h_3=h_2-O$ . We have: $$\\tilde\\psi(X)h_3(x_0,y,z+z_0)=Xh(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,y,z+z_0))-\\tilde\\psi(X)O(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,y,z+z_0))\\\\=yX^Th_1(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z_0))+o(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,y,z+z_0))-XO(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,y,z+z_0))\\\\=yX^Th(\\tilde\\psi^{-1}(x_0,0,z+z_0)).\n$$ (I understand that you be not happy with this term multiplying $y$ .  You can try to replace $O$ by another function to really finish the proof. I will try something along the week.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original question. The user wants each assumption to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem, it's about proving a special case of Vishik's Normal Form for a vector field near the boundary of a manifold. The key elements here are the definitions of the spaces, the vector field, and the conditions on the fold points.\n\nStarting with the assumptions:\n\n1. The manifold in question is $T^2 := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\mathbb{T}^2 \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$. So the first assumption is about the specific torus embedded in the 3-sphere.\n\n2. The function $h$ is defined as $h(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$. So the second assumption is the definition of this function.\n\n3. The set $\\mathbb{S}^+$ is defined as $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^3 \\mid h(x) \\geq 0\\}$. That's the third assumption.\n\n4. The vector field $X$ is defined on $\\mathbb{S}^+$, taking values in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, smooth, and $X(p) \\in T_p\\mathbb{S}^3$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{S}^+$. So the fourth assumption is the properties of $X$.\n\n5. It's given that $X(p) \\neq 0$ for all $p \\in T^2$. That's another condition on $X$.\n\n6. The definitions of $Xh(p)$ and $X^2 h(p)$ as the first and second derivatives along $X$. These are part of the problem setup, so they should be listed as assumptions.\n\n7. The definition of a fold point: $p \\in T^2$ where $Xh(p) = 0$ and $X^2 h(p) \\neq 0$. This is a crucial condition for the theorem.\n\n8. The theorem's hypothesis: all points on $T^2$ where $Xh(q) = 0$ are fold points. This is an assumption for the theorem.\n\n9. The conclusion to prove is the existence of a local chart around a fold point $p$ where the vector field takes a specific normal form. However, the problem statement is to prove this theorem, so the problem is about establishing this normal form under the given conditions.\n\nNow, I need to list each of these assumptions line by line, ensuring each addresses one property or condition. Some of these can be combined if they naturally belong together. For example, the definition of $X$ includes being a smooth function into $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and lying in the tangent space. Since both are properties of $X$, they can be listed together as one assumption. Similarly, the non-vanishing of $X$ on $T^2$ is another separate condition.\n\nWait, the user's example separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each condition should be separate. Let me check again:\n\n- The manifold $T^2$ is defined as a specific subset of $\\mathbb{S}^3$. That's one assumption.\n\n- The function $h$ is defined with a specific formula. Second assumption.\n\n- $\\mathbb{S}^+$ is defined as the set where $h \\geq 0$. Third assumption.\n\n- $X$ is a vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$ with specific smoothness and tangency conditions. Fourth assumption.\n\n- $X(p) \\neq 0$ for all $p \\in T^2$. Fifth assumption.\n\n- Definitions of $Xh$ and $X^2 h$ via dot products. These could be two separate assumptions, but since they're both definitions of operations on $X$, maybe combine them as one? Wait, the user's example had each line as a single property. So perhaps each definition is its own assumption.\n\n- Fold point definition: $Xh(p) = 0$ and $X^2 h(p) \\neq 0$. Here, two conditions for a fold point. But according to the user's instruction, each assumption should address only one property. Hmm. But the fold point is a definition that requires both conditions. However, the problem's theorem states that all points where $Xh(q)=0$ are fold points. So the hypothesis is that whenever $Xh(q)=0$ on $T^2$, then automatically $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$. So perhaps the theorem's assumption is that all such points are fold points, meaning that whenever $Xh(q)=0$, then $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the assumption is that for all $q \\in T^2$, if $Xh(q) = 0$, then $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$. So this is a single assumption about the vector field $X$.\n\nPutting this all together, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $T^2 := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\mathbb{T}^2 \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$,\n- $h(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $\\mathbb{S}^+ = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^3 \\mid h(x) \\geq 0\\}$,\n- $X$ is a vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$ such that $X: \\mathbb{S}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$ is smooth and $X(p) \\in T_p\\mathbb{S}^3$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{S}^+$,\n- $X(p) \\neq 0$ for all $p \\in T^2$,\n- For all $q \\in T^2$, if $Xh(q) = 0$, then $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$,\n- $p \\in T^2$ is a fold point (i.e., $Xh(p) = 0$ and $X^2 h(p) \\neq 0$).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is to prove the theorem under the hypothesis that all points on $T^2$ where $Xh(q) = 0$ are fold points. So the main assumption for the theorem is that for the vector field $X$, any $q \\in T^2$ with $Xh(q) = 0$ must satisfy $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the problem is to show that under this condition, for any such fold point $p$, there's a local chart where the vector field takes the specified normal form.\n\nSo in the assumptions, we need to include:\n\n- The setup of the spaces (T^2, S^3, S^+),\n- The definition of h,\n- The properties of the vector field X (smooth, tangent, non-vanishing on T^2),\n- The condition that all zeros of Xh on T^2 are fold points,\n- And the specific fold point p in T^2.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So perhaps each bullet point above is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- $T^2 := \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\mathbb{T}^2 \\subset \\mathbb{S}^3$,\n- $h(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $\\mathbb{S}^+ = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{S}^3 \\mid h(x) \\geq 0\\}$,\n- $X$ is a smooth vector field on $\\mathbb{S}^+$,\n- $X(p) \\in T_p\\mathbb{S}^3$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{S}^+$,\n- $X(p) \\neq 0$ for all $p \\in T^2$,\n- For all $q \\in T^2$, if $Xh(q) = 0$, then $X^2 h(q) \\neq 0$,\n- $p$ is a point in $T^2$ where $Xh(p) = 0$ and $X^2 h(p) \\neq 0$.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the existence of the local chart as stated in Vishik's Normal Form.\n\nChecking the original problem, the user also mentions some notations and definitions, but the key assumptions are the setup of the manifold, the function h, the vector field X with its properties, the non-vanishing on T^2, the fold point condition, and the specific fold point p.\n\nTherefore, structuring accordingly.",
