    "AcceptedAnswer": "Remark: I proved the second inequality. Maybe the first inequality can be proved in similar way. I have not yet tried it. I used Maple software. Let us prove that $$\\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n]{n!} < \\Big(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\Big)^n, \\quad \\forall n\\ge 1.$$ We first introduce some auxiliary results (Facts 1 through 6) used to prove the inequality. Fact 1 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have \\begin{align}\n\\sqrt[n]{n!} &> \\sqrt[2n]{\\pi}\\, \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{e}} \\sqrt[6n]{8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100}}, \\\\\n\\sqrt[n]{n!} &< \\sqrt[2n]{\\pi}\\, \\frac{n}{\\mathrm{e}} \\sqrt[6n]{8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{30}}, \\\\\n\\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!} &< \\sqrt[2n+2]{\\pi}\\, \\frac{n+1}{\\mathrm{e}} \\sqrt[6n+6]{8n^3 + 28n^2 + 33n + \\frac{391}{30}}.\n\\end{align} See: G. E. Andrews and B. C. Berndt, Ramanujan's Lost Notebook Part IV, 2013, page 111. Fact 2 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have $$\\ln \\Big(8n^3 + 28n^2 + 33n + \\frac{391}{30}\\Big) - \\ln \\Big(8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100}\\Big)\n< \\frac{3}{n} - \\frac{2}{n^2} + \\frac{3607}{2400n^3}.$$ The proof is simple and thus omitted. Fact 3 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have $$\\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100})\n > 3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln n + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{47}{2400n^3}.$$ The proof is simple and thus omitted. Fact 4 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have $$\\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{30}) < 3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln n + \\frac{1}{2n}.$$ The proof is simple and thus omitted. Fact 5 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have $$n\\ln n - n \\ln (n+1) > -1 + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{3n^2}.$$ The proof is simple and thus omitted. Fact 6 : For all integers $n\\ge 1$ , we have $$\\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!}  < \\Big(1 + \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big)\\sqrt[n]{n!}.$$ The proof is given later. $\\phantom{2}$ Now let us begin. If $1 \\le n\\le 5$ , the inequality is verified directly. In the following, we assume that $n \\ge 6$ . According to Fact 6, it suffices to prove that $$\\Big(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big)\\sqrt[n]{n!}\n< (\\frac{n}{n+1})^n.$$ According to Fact 1, it suffices to prove that \\begin{align}\n&\\ln \\Big(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big)\n+ \\frac{1}{2n}\\ln \\pi + \\ln n - 1 + \\frac{1}{6n}\\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{30})\\\\\n<\\ & n\\ln n - n \\ln (n+1).\n\\end{align} According to Fact 4 and 5, it suffices to prove that \\begin{align}\n&\\ln \\Big(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big)\n+ \\frac{1}{2n}\\ln \\pi + \\ln n - 1 + \\frac{1}{6n}(3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln n + \\frac{1}{2n})\\\\\n<\\ & -1 + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{3n^2}.\n\\end{align} Let \\begin{align}\nG(x) &= -1 + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\frac{1}{3x^2} - \\ln \\Big(\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{\\ln x + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2x^2}\\Big)\\\\\n&\\quad - \\Big(\\frac{1}{2x}\\ln \\pi + \\ln x - 1 + \\frac{1}{6x}(3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln x + \\frac{1}{2x})\\Big).\n\\end{align} We have $$G'(x) = \\frac{1}{6x^3(2x - \\ln x - \\ln 2\\pi + 1)}(p_2(\\ln x)^2 + p_1 \\ln x + p_0)$$ where \\begin{align}\np_2 &= -3x, \\\\\np_1 &= -(6\\ln 2\\pi - 9)x - 5, \\\\\np_0 &= (-3\\ln^2 2\\pi + 9\\ln 2\\pi +4)x + 5 - 5\\ln 2\\pi.\n\\end{align} Clearly, $p_2, p_1 < 0$ for $x \\ge 1$ . Since $\\ln x > \\frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}$ for $x > 1$ , we have $$p_2(\\ln x)^2 + p_1 \\ln x + p_0 < p_2\\Big(\\frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}\\Big)^2 + p_1\\frac{2(x-1)}{x+1} + p_0,\n\\quad \\forall x \\ge 6.$$ It is easy to prove that $$p_2\\Big(\\frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}\\Big)^2 + p_1\\frac{2(x-1)}{x+1} + p_0 < 0, \\quad \\forall x \\ge 6.$$ Thus, $G'(x) < 0$ for $x\\ge 6$ . Note also that $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} G(x) = 0$ .\nThus, we have $G(x) > 0$ for $x\\ge 6$ . This completes the proof. $\\phantom{2}$ Proof of Fact 6 : If $1 \\le n\\le 3$ , the inequality is verified directly. In the following, we assume that $n \\ge 4$ .\nWe need to prove that \\begin{align}\n\\ln \\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!}\n< \\ln \\sqrt[n]{n!} + \\ln \\Big(1 + \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big).\n\\end{align} According to Fact 1, it suffices to prove that \\begin{align}\n&\\frac{1}{2n+2}\\ln \\pi + \\ln (n+1) - 1 + \\frac{1}{6n+6}\\ln (8n^3 + 28n^2 + 33n + \\frac{391}{30})\\\\\n< \\ & \\frac{1}{2n}\\ln \\pi + \\ln n - 1 + \\frac{1}{6n}\\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100})\\\\\n&\\quad + \\ln \\Big(1 + \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n^2}\\Big)\n\\end{align} or \\begin{align}\n& \\frac{1}{6n+6}\\Big(\\ln (8n^3 + 28n^2 + 33n + \\frac{391}{30}) - \\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100})\\Big)\\\\\n< \\ & \\frac{1}{2n(n+1)}\\ln \\pi + \\frac{1}{6n(n+1)}\\ln (8n^3 + 4n^2 + n + \\frac{1}{100})\\\\\n&\\quad + \\ln \\Big(1 - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n(n+1)}\\Big).\n\\end{align} According to Fact 2 and 3, it suffices to prove that \\begin{align}\n& \\frac{1}{6n+6}\\Big(\\frac{3}{n} - \\frac{2}{n^2} + \\frac{3607}{2400n^3}\\Big)\\\\\n< \\ & \\frac{1}{2n(n+1)}\\ln \\pi + \\frac{1}{6n(n+1)}\n\\Big(3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln n + \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{47}{2400n^3}\\Big)\\\\\n&\\quad + \\ln \\Big(1 - \\frac{\\ln n + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2n(n+1)}\\Big).\n\\end{align} Let \\begin{align}\nF(x) &= \\frac{1}{2x(x+1)}\\ln \\pi + \\frac{1}{6x(x+1)}\\Big(3\\ln 2 + 3\\ln x + \\frac{1}{2x} - \\frac{47}{2400x^3}\\Big)\\\\\n&\\quad + \\ln \\Big(1 - \\frac{\\ln x + \\ln 2\\pi - 1}{2x(x+1)}\\Big)\n- \\frac{1}{6x+6}\\Big(\\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{2}{x^2} + \\frac{3607}{2400x^3}\\Big).\n\\end{align} We have $$F'(x) = \\frac{1}{3600x^5(x+1)^2(2x^2-\\ln x - \\ln 2\\pi + 2x+1)}(q_2(\\ln x)^2 + q_1\\ln x + q_0)$$ where \\begin{align}\nq_2 &= 3600x^4+1800x^3, \\\\\nq_1 &= (7200\\ln 2\\pi - 9000)x^4 + (3600\\ln 2\\pi - 900)x^3 - 607x^2 - 2764x - 47, \\\\\nq_0 &= -9000x^5 + (3600\\ln^2 2\\pi - 9000\\ln 2\\pi -2386)x^4\n+(1800\\ln^2 2\\pi  - 900\\ln 2\\pi+5842)x^3\\\\\n&\\quad +(-607\\ln 2\\pi + 6229)x^2 + (-2764\\ln 2\\pi + 2858)x - 47\\ln 2\\pi +47.\n\\end{align} It is easy to prove that $q_2, q_1 > 0$ for $x\\ge 1$ .\nSince $x > \\ln^2 x$ and $x > \\ln x$ for $x\\ge 1$ , we have $$q_2(\\ln x)^2 + q_1\\ln x + q_0 < q_2 x + q_1 x + q_0, \\quad \\forall x\\ge 4.$$ It is easy to prove that $q_2 x + q_1 x + q_0 < 0$ for $x \\ge 4$ .\nThus, we have $F'(x) < 0$ for $x\\ge 4$ . Note also that $\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} F(x) = 0$ . Thus, we have $F(x) > 0$ for $x \\ge 4$ .\nThis completes the proof of Fact 6.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.\n\nThe original question is asking to show that the inequality $$\\left(\\dfrac{n}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1}<\\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!}-\\sqrt[n]{n!}<\\left(\\dfrac{n}{n+1}\\right)^n$$ holds for all positive integers $n$. Additionally, the user mentions that if this inequality is proven, then the limit as $n$ approaches infinity of the difference between the two roots is $1/e$. However, the user is stuck on proving the inequality itself.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The problem states that $n$ is a positive integer, which is denoted by $n \\in \\Bbb N^{+}$. There are no other explicit conditions given, like ranges or additional constraints on $n$. The user doesn't mention any specific functions or properties beyond the factorial and the inequalities involving exponents and roots.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that $n$ is an integer and that $n$ is divisible by 7, even though the original problem statement only mentioned \"for every integer $n$\". Wait, actually, in the example, the formatted problem included an assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Hmm, maybe the example was modified. Wait, no—the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. The user probably assumed that $n$ is divisible by 7, but the original problem just said \"for every integer $n$\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer $n\" without restriction. So perhaps the example had a mistake, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is to structure the problem with assumptions. The original problem here states $n \\in \\Bbb N^{+}$, so the assumption is that $n$ is a positive integer. There's no other condition given. So the assumptions should list that $n$ is a positive integer. Each assumption line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So here, only one assumption: $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but looking at the example, they split into two assumptions: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the assumption was that $n$ is an integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. So maybe in the example, there was an error. However, perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem has certain conditions, the formatted problem might have more specific assumptions. But in the given problem here, the original problem only states $n$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption should be only that $n$ is a positive integer. But let me verify the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"where $n\\in \\Bbb N^{+}$.\" So $n$ is a positive integer. There's no mention of divisibility or other conditions. Therefore, the assumption is only that $n$ is a positive integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption line should be \"$n$ is a positive integer\".\n\nSo following the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer $n$\", in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that $n$ is divisible by 7. But that seems conflicting. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a typo, and the formatted problem was correct. For example, maybe the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when $n$ is divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer $n$\". But regardless, in the current problem, the user's task is to structure the problem as per the example.\n\nSo, applying that to the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\left(\\dfrac{n}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1}<\\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!}-\\sqrt[n]{n!}<\\left(\\dfrac{n}{n+1}\\right)^n.$$\n\nWait, the original problem mentions that this inequality can be proved, leading to a limit of $1/e$, but the user can't prove the inequality. So the problem is to prove the inequality. The assumptions are only on $n$ being a positive integer. So the formatted problem should have assumption line \"$n$ is a positive integer\" and problem line as stated.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the original problem. The inequalities involve factorials, which are defined for non-negative integers, but since $n$ is in $\\Bbb N^{+}$, $n$ starts from 1. There's no other conditions or objects here. So the formatted problem should have just that one assumption.",
