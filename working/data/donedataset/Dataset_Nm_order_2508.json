    "Content": "Recently I encountered this problem Show that $$\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{x_{n}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{10}$$ where $x_{n}$ is the $n^{\\text{th}}$ positive root of $\\tan x = x$. I found many threads on MSE regarding solutions to $\\tan x = x$ like this and this which suggest that the series $\\sum 1/x_{n}^{2}$ is convergent if we compare it with $\\sum 1/n^{2}$. But at the same time I have no idea how we can sum this up. Please help with suggestions or an answer. Update : I further tried to relate it with the sum $\\sum 1/n^{2} = \\pi^{2}/6$ and we can rewrite it as $\\sum 1/(n^{2}\\pi^{2}) = 1/6$ so that if $y_{n}$ is $n^{\\text{th}}$ positive root of $\\sin x = 0$ then $\\sum 1/y_{n}^{2} = 1/6$. I believe this has got to do with the product $$\\frac{\\sin x}{x} = \\prod_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\left(1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{n^{2}\\pi^{2}}\\right)$$ where we can see the factors corresponding to actual roots. We can now compare the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides to get $\\sum 1/y_{n}^{2} = 1/6$. I don't see any product related to equation $\\tan x = x$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice for non-zero $z$ , we have $$\\tan z = z \\quad\\iff\\quad f(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z} - \\cos z = 0$$ Since $\\sin z$ and $\\cos z$ are entire functions of order $1$ at infinity, so does $f(z)$ . For small $z$ ,  we have $$\nf(z) =\n\\left(1 - \\frac{z^2}{3!} + \\frac{z^4}{5!}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\frac{z^4}{4!}\\right) + O(z^6)\n= \\frac{z^2}{3} - \\frac{z^4}{30} + O(z^6)\\tag{*1}$$ This means $z = 0$ is a double root for $f(z)$ . $f(z)$ is clearly an even function. Its non-zero roots will come in pairs.\nLet $\\pm \\alpha_n, n = 1, 2,\\ldots$ be the non-zero roots ordered by $0 < |\\alpha_1| \\le |\\alpha_2| \\le \\ldots$ .\nBy Hadamard factorization theorem , $f(z)$ have following factorization: $$f(z) = z^2 e^{g(z)} \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty\n\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{z}{\\alpha_n}\\right)e^{\\frac{z}{\\alpha_n}}\\right)\n\\left(\\left(1+\\frac{z}{\\alpha_n}\\right)e^{-\\frac{z}{\\alpha_n}}\\right)\n= z^2 e^{g(z)} \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{z^2}{\\alpha_n^2}\\right)\n$$ where $g(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $1$ . Once again, since $f(z)$ is an even function, $\\deg g(z) \\le 1 \\implies g(z)$ is a constant. Compare this with $(*1)$ , we get $$f(z) = \\frac{z^2}{3} \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(1-\\frac{z^2}{\\alpha_n^2}\\right)$$ Assume one can show that all the $\\alpha_n$ lies on real axis and $|\\alpha_n|$ increases so quickly such that $\\displaystyle\\;\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{a_n^2}\\;$ converges. It is then legal\nto expand the infinite product and obtain $$f(z) = \\frac{z^2}{3} \\left( 1 - \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\alpha_n^2}\\right) z^2 + O(z^4) \\right)$$ Compare this with $(*1)$ again, we get $\\displaystyle\\;\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\alpha_n^2} = \\frac{1}{10}\\;$ . Update To see why all $\\alpha_n$ lies on the real axis,\nlet $z = x + iy$ be any non-real root of $\\tan z = z$ , we have $$\\frac{\\sin z}{z} = \\cos z\n\\iff \\frac{e^{iz} - e^{-iz}}{iz} = e^{iz} + e^{-iz}\n\\iff e^{iz}(1-iz) = e^{-iz}(1+iz)$$ Taking absolute value and square on both sides of last expression, it is equivalent to $$\ne^{-2y}((1+y)^2 + x^2) = e^{2y}((1-y)^2 + x^2)\n\\iff \\sinh(2y)(x^2 + y^2 + 1) - 2y\\cosh(2y) = 0\n$$ This leads to $$x^2 \n= \\frac{1}{\\sinh^2(2y)} - (y-\\coth(2y))^2\n= - (y - \\tanh(y))(y-\\coth(y))\n\\tag{*2}$$ The equation $y = \\coth(y)$ has a unique root $\\mu \\approx 1.199678640257734$ on postive real axis. When $|y| > \\mu$ , RHS of $(*2)$ is negative and there is no real solution for $x$ . A plot of RHS of $(*2)$ over the interval $[-\\mu,\\mu]$ show that it is bounded above\nby $0.1$ . If $\\tan z = z$ has any non-real root, that root need to fall within a small\nrectangle $$\\big\\{\\; x + iy : |x| \\le \\sqrt{0.1}, |y| \\le \\mu\\;\\big\\}$$ A plot of $f(z)$ over this small rectangle indicate there isn't any non-real root.\nFrom this, we can conclude all $\\alpha_n$ lies on the real axis. Finally, about the issue whether $\\displaystyle\\;\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\alpha_n^2}$ converges or not. One can superpose the plot of $z$ vs $z$ over the plot of $\\tan z$ vs. $z$ . One will observe $$n \\pi < \\alpha_n < (n + \\frac12)\\pi,\\quad \\forall N$$ This immediately leads to $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\alpha_n^2} < \\frac{1}{\\pi^2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac16 < \\infty$$ and the sum over $\\displaystyle\\;\\frac{1}{\\alpha_n^2}\\;$ does converge.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original question. The problem is about showing that the sum of 1 over x_n squared equals 1/10, where x_n are the positive roots of tan x = x. \n\nLooking at the question, the user mentions that x_n is the nth positive root of the equation tan x = x. So the first assumption is that x_n are the positive solutions to tan x = x. Then, the problem is to sum 1/x_n² to get 1/10. The user also talks about convergence and relates it to the sum over 1/n², but that's part of their thought process, not an assumption. The update mentions comparing with the product formula for sin x/x, which is part of their attempt but not an assumption of the original problem. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. x_n is the nth positive root of the equation tan x = x.\n2. The sum is over all positive roots of this equation.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is to show that the sum equals 1/10. \n\nWait, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on x_n other than being positive roots of tan x = x. The user's update is about their approach but the actual problem doesn't add more assumptions. So the only assumption is that x_n are the positive roots of tan x = x, each x_n is positive, and the sum is over all such roots. But in the example given, assumptions were listed line by line. Here, maybe two assumptions: one that x_n is the nth positive root of tan x = x, and perhaps that all x_n are positive? Although the problem statement already says \"positive root\". So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive root of the equation tan x = x,\nThe sum is taken over all positive roots x_n.\n\nBut the example had each assumption on separate lines. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive root of tan x = x,\nEach x_n is positive,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² is considered.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement already says \"positive root\", so maybe \"Each x_n is positive\" is redundant. However, to list assumptions clearly, maybe it's better to include it. Alternatively, the key assumption is just that x_n are the positive roots. The problem is to sum 1/x_n². So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive root of the equation tan x = x,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² converges.\n\nWait, but the user mentions that the series is convergent by comparing to 1/n². So maybe convergence is part of the problem's given, but the original problem asks to show the sum equals 1/10. So the actual assumptions are only about x_n being the positive roots. The problem is to compute the sum. So maybe the only assumption is that x_n are the positive roots of tan x = x. But in the example, they listed two assumptions, even if one was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the first assumption is x_n is the nth positive root of tan x = x, and the sum is over all such roots. But I need to split them into separate lines. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, x_n is the n-th positive root of the equation tan x = x,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² is convergent.\n\nBut the problem is to show the sum equals 1/10, and the user is asking how to compute it. So the convergence might be part of what's needed, but perhaps the problem just states the sum equals 1/10. So the problem as stated in the original question is to show that the sum is 1/10. The assumptions would be about x_n being the positive roots of tan x = x. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive root of the equation tan x = x,\nAll x_n are positive.\n\nBut again, the problem statement already specifies \"positive root\", so maybe the second assumption is redundant. However, to follow the format, perhaps list each key point. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the definition of x_n. The example had two assumptions even though the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the user listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong. Hmm. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem.\n\nThe original problem states: Show that the sum of 1/x_n² from n=1 to infinity equals 1/10 where x_n is the nth positive root of tan x = x. The assumptions here are that x_n are the positive roots of tan x = x. The problem is to compute the sum. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each positive integer n, x_n is the n-th positive root of tan x = x,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² is considered.\n\nBut maybe the problem already implies that. Alternatively, since the problem is to show convergence and the sum, but the user mentions that they already know it converges by comparison. But according to the instructions, the assumptions should list all conditions. Since the equation tan x = x has positive roots x_n that grow in a certain way, but maybe the key assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive solution to the equation tan x = x,\nAll x_n are positive real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² = 1/10.\n\nThat seems to capture the problem. The example given had two assumptions even if one was redundant. So in this case, two assumptions: x_n is the nth positive root, and all x_n are positive (though redundant, but to be explicit). Alternatively, maybe just one assumption: x_n is the nth positive root of tan x = x. Since the problem states \"positive root\", maybe that's sufficient. But to follow the example's structure, which split into two lines even if one was a property of the same object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx_n is the n-th positive root of the equation tan x = x,\nEach x_n is a positive real number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/x_n² = 1/10.\n\nYes, that should work.",
