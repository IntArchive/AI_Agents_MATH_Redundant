    "Content": "Let $X=(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)$, where $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ are iid. I'm looking for a result (and a proof outline) on the concentration of the max abs value of these Gaussians, $\\|X\\|_\\infty$. That is, some result of the form $P(\\bigl | \\|X\\|_\\infty -\\sqrt{2\\log (2n)}\\bigr |>t)<o(t)$, where $o(t)$ is any reasonable function that goes to $0$ as $t$ gets large. I know these results: $E \\|X\\|_\\infty \\leq \\sqrt{2 \\log (2n)}$, $P(\\|X\\|_\\infty \\geq \\sqrt{2 \\log (2n)}+t)\\leq 2\\exp(-t^2 /2)$, which seems to be the \"right tail\" of the result I'm looking for.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So you just need to show that $P(\\|X\\|_\\infty \\leq \\sqrt{2 \\log (2n)}-\\epsilon)$ is small. This is easy because \n$$\nP\\left(\\|X\\|_\\infty \\leq a_n\\right) = P\\left(|X_1|\\leq a_n\\right)^n = (2\\Phi(a_n) - 1)^n\\le \\left(1-2\\frac{a_n}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}(a_n^2 + 1)}e^{-a_n^2/2}\\right)^n.\n$$\nPlugging $a_n = \\sqrt{2\\log (2n)-\\delta}$, $$\nP\\left(\\|X\\|_\\infty \\leq a_n\\right) \\le \\left(1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\log (2n)-\\delta}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}n(2\\log (2n)-\\delta + 1)}e^{\\delta/2}\\right)^n\\\\\n\\le \\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}n(\\sqrt{2\\log (2n)-\\delta} + 1)}e^{\\delta/2}\\right)^n\\\\\n\\le \\left(1-\\frac{e^{\\delta/2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}n(\\sqrt{2\\log (2n)} + 1)}\\right)^n\\\\\n\\le \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{e^{\\delta/2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}(\\sqrt{2\\log (2n)}+ 1)}\\right\\},\n$$\nSo you can take $\\delta = K\\log\\log n$ with some $K$ large enough in order to make this small. You might be disappointed by the fact that this goes to infinity. This is not so bad as in fact the corresponding $\\epsilon$ is of order\n$$\n\\frac{c\\log \\log n}{\\sqrt{\\log n}}\n$$\nand does go to zero. If you want to have it fixed, you will get even some exponentially small estimates for probability.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about the concentration of the maximum absolute value of independent Gaussian variables. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The question mentions that X is a vector (X₁, ..., Xₙ) where each Xᵢ is iid standard normal. The key points here are:\n\n1. Each Xᵢ follows a standard normal distribution, N(0,1).\n2. The variables X₁, ..., Xₙ are independent and identically distributed (iid).\n3. The problem is concerned with the infinity norm (max absolute value) of X, denoted ||X||_∞.\n4. The user is seeking a concentration inequality result around the expectation, which they mention is bounded by √(2 log(2n)).\n\nWait, the original question also states some existing results: the expectation bound and a tail probability. But the user is looking for a two-sided concentration result. The example provided in the problem format includes assumptions that are given in the problem statement. So in this case, the assumptions would be the iid standard normal variables and perhaps the form of the concentration inequality they're aiming for? Wait, no. The assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the results they want to prove.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a vector of components X₁, ..., Xₙ.\n- Each Xᵢ is distributed as N(0,1).\n- The Xᵢ are independent.\n- They are identically distributed.\n\nBut the problem is to prove a concentration inequality for ||X||_∞ around √(2 log(2n)) with some bound on the probability. However, in the example given, the assumption included the divisibility condition. Here, the problem doesn't have an extra condition beyond the setup. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nEach component X_i of vector X is a standard normal random variable,\nThe components X_1, ..., X_n are independent,\nThe components X_1, ..., X_n are identically distributed.\n\nThen the problem is to show that the probability that the max absolute value deviates from sqrt(2 log(2n)) by more than t is bounded by a function o(t) that tends to 0 as t increases.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions \"some result of the form...\" so perhaps the problem statement is to prove such a concentration inequality. But the user is structuring the problem as per the example, so the problem line would be the actual question, which is to prove the concentration result.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumptions:\nEach X_i follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1,\nThe random variables X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent,\nThe random variables X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are identically distributed.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a function o(t) such that o(t) approaches 0 as t becomes large, and \nP(| ||X||_∞ - √(2 log(2n)) | > t) < o(t).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user writes the probability as P(| ||X||_infty - sqrt(2 log(2n)) | > t) < o(t), where o(t) is any reasonable function that goes to 0 as t gets large. However, in probability concentration inequalities, typically the bound is a specific function, like exponential in t. The user mentions that they know the right tail result, which is P(||X||_infty >= sqrt(2 log(2n)) + t) <= 2 exp(-t²/2). They are looking for a two-sided version. So perhaps the problem is to show that the probability of the maximum deviating from sqrt(2 log(2n)) by more than t is bounded by a function that goes to 0 as t increases, which is more precise than just o(t), but the problem statement as given uses o(t). The user might be asking for a result of that form, possibly tightening the existing tail bounds.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. So the assumptions here would be the iid standard normals. The problem is to prove the concentration inequality as stated by the user. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then the problem statement as given.",
