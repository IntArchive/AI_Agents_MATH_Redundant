    "Content": "In 2-d space, it is possible to take any shape and fit it inside a square such that it touches all the sides of the square. In other words, its projection on the x-axis is the same as its projection on the y-axis. To see this, we can consider a function which is the ratio of its projection on the x-axis to its projection on the y-axis. As we rotate by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , this ratio will go from one side of $1$ to the other. Because it is a continuous function, it must cross $1$ . I was wondering about extending this result to 3-d space. I have a general 3-d object and would like to rotate it such that its projection along all three axes becomes the same. Can we prove this is always possible or otherwise? And if it isn't possible in general, any non-trivial special cases where it will be?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof of the conjecture Short sketch of proof . For every choice of an axis of rotation, one can spin the body around that chosen axis. As the OP noted, one can make  the two perpendicular dimensions in this plane match. Unfortunately, the thickness of the body in the third direction,  measured along the chosen axis, might be too large or too small. In fact we know the third dimension can be made too large/too small if we point the axis in the direction of (A) absolutely largest/ (B) absolute smallest possible thickness of the body. If we gradually move the axis of rotation from  A to B there must be an intermediate Goldilocks  choice $C$ that is just right. Details of proof. For every unit vector $\\vec n$ on the unit sphere $S$ , denote the thickness of the body in that direction by $h(\\vec n)$ . (The thickness is the length of the segment obtained by projecting the body orthogonally onto the line whose direction is $\\vec n$ .) This is a non-negative continuous function of $\\vec n \\in S$ . Note that $h(-\\vec n)=h(\\vec n)$ . The continuous function $h(\\vec n)$ attains its absolute max  at least once at some direction; call one such choice $A\\in S$ . Likewise  its absolute minimum is attained somewhere; call one such choice $B\\in S$ . Construct a continuous path on the sphere from $A$ to $B$ . Let $C$ be any intermediate point on that path. Regarding $C$ as the vertical axis pointing upward out of our field of view, the directions perpendicular to $C$ sweep out a circle of directions in the plane parametrized by an angle $\\theta$ . We want to show that there is a solution of $f_1(\\theta)=h(\\theta)= f_2(\\theta)=h(\\theta+\\pi/2)$ . (This provides a pair of perpendicular directions of equal width in the plane). Technical point: in order to single out an attribute of the solutions that can be shown to be continuous as we vary $C$ , some extra care is needed.  The problem is that the domain point $\\theta$ might not be unique or might not depend continuously on $C$ .  In contrast, the maximal range value we construct below will depend continuously on $C$ . Define $f_3(\\theta)=min(f_1(\\theta), f_2(\\theta))$ The two planar regions defined in polar coordinates as $r\\leq f_1(\\theta)$ and $r\\leq f_2(\\theta)$ respectively  are two congruent regions that are rotated by a right angle. Each of these congruent  regions is defined as an intersection of half-planes, hence the region a convex region in the plane.\nThe intersection of these two convex congruent regions is another convex region whose polar equation is $r= f_3(\\theta)$ .\n(see picture below). The largest value of $f_3(\\theta)$ will be denoted by $r_{max}(C)$ . It is the largest possible value of $r$ for which $r=  h(\\theta)= h(\\theta+\\pi/2)$ .\nContinuity of $r_{max}(C)$ follows from the joint continuity of the expression $f_3$ as a function of $\\theta$ and $C$ on the compact configuration space $(\\theta, C)$ .) Note that by the choice of $A$ as the absolutely largest value of $h(\\vec n)$ on the entire sphere, it follows  that $r_{max}(A) \\leq h(A)$ . At the end of the path, by construction of $B$ as a point where $h(\\vec n)$ is absolutely smallest,  we must have $r_{max}(B)\\geq h(B)$ . By the intermediate value theorem, there is a point $C$ where $r_{max}(C)= h(C)$ .  At this point $C$ we have the equality of the thickness function $h$ in three perpendicular directions. QED. P.S.  For a nontrivial class of extreme examples for which equal widths do occur in every direction , you can explore the topic of surfaces of constant width The obvious example is a sphere. Remarkably, however, there exist many non-spherical convex smooth surfaces with this property: the  projected width of the object on  each line of projection is constant in every direction chosen for the line. This is an outline of how aspherical constant-width  surfaces are constructed. Starting with a desired function $h(\\vec n)$ one parametrizes the desired surface as $\\vec p= h(\\vec n) \\vec n + \\vec t(\\vec n)$ where the correction term $\\vec t$ is perpendicular to $\\vec n$ . It turns out that the correct choice for the correction is $\\vec t=\\nabla_S h$ where $\\nabla_S h$ denote the spherical gradient of $h$ , (the gradient of the function $h$ treated as a function on the unit sphere.\nTo create a constant width surface  that is a perturbation of the round sphere, of radius $R$ , set $h= R+ \\epsilon(\\vec n)$ where the perturbation is a small odd function of $\\vec n$ . Then the total width in direction $\\vec n$ is $h(\\vec n) + h(-\\vec n)=2R$ . The messy details are checking that the perturbation $\\epsilon$ is small enough to preserve convexity of the surface.  That boils down to looking at the second derivatives of $\\epsilon $ on the sphere.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if any arbitrary 3D shape can be rotated inside a cube so that it touches all six sides. In 2D, they mentioned using a continuous function argument based on projections as you rotate the shape. The idea is that when you rotate a shape by 90 degrees, the projections on the x and y axes swap. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some angle where the projections are equal, meaning the shape touches all sides of a square.\n\nExtending this to 3D, the user is asking if there's a rotation such that the projections on the x, y, and z axes are all the same. First, I need to clarify the assumptions. The original problem in 2D assumes the shape is in 2D space and can be rotated. The key there was the continuous change in projections leading to an equality by IVT.\n\nFor the 3D case, the assumptions would be similar. The object is a 3D shape, and we can rotate it freely in 3D space. The goal is to find a rotation where the projections onto all three axes are equal. But in 3D, rotations are more complex because there are three degrees of freedom (e.g., Euler angles). The challenge is whether there's a rotation that equalizes all three projections simultaneously.\n\nI need to structure this problem according to the given format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement should ask if such a rotation exists for any 3D object, or if there are special cases where it's possible.\n\nWait, the original question mentions \"fitted inside a cube so it touches all the sides.\" Touching all sides would require that the projections on each axis are equal to the cube's side length. So the problem reduces to whether there's a rotation where the projections on x, y, z axes are equal. If the cube is scaled to fit the object, then the projections need to be equal. The question is about existence of such a rotation.\n\nAssumptions would be: the object is a 3D shape, can be rotated in 3D space, and projections are considered along the three orthogonal axes. The problem is to prove whether for any 3D object, there exists a rotation such that all three projections are equal. If not, find special cases where it's possible.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions listed were specific, like n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more general. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe object is a three-dimensional shape.\nThe object can be rotated freely in three-dimensional space.\nProjections are taken along the x, y, and z axes.\nThe problem is to determine if such a rotation exists for any object, making all three projections equal.\n\nBut wait, the original question's problem statement is a bit more precise. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Can an arbitrary 3-d shape be fitted inside a cube so it touches all the sides? In other words, its projection on the x-axis is the same as its projection on the y-axis. [...] I was wondering about extending this result to 3-d space. [...] rotate it such that its projection along all three axes becomes the same.\"\n\nSo the key is that fitting into a cube with all sides touched requires that the projections on each axis are equal. The question is whether such a rotation exists for any 3D object. The user is also asking if it's not possible in general, what special cases allow it.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe object is a three-dimensional shape.\nThe object can be rotated in three-dimensional space.\nThe projections of the object onto the x, y, and z axes are considered.\nThe cube is such that the object touches all its sides when placed inside.\n\nProblem: Prove whether for any three-dimensional object, there exists a rotation such that its projections along the x, y, and z axes are equal. If not, identify non-trivial special cases where this is possible.\n\nBut the original 2D case didn't have an assumption that the shape is convex or anything, just any shape. So the 3D problem should assume a general 3D object, not necessarily convex or anything.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe object is a three-dimensional shape.\nThe object can be freely rotated in three-dimensional space.\nProjections of the object are measured along three orthogonal axes (x, y, z).\nProblem:\nProve that any three-dimensional object can be rotated such that its projections along the x, y, and z axes are equal, or determine if this is not always possible. Additionally, identify any non-trivial special cases where such a rotation exists.\n\nWait, but the original user question is phrased as \"Can we prove this is always possible or otherwise? And if it isn't possible in general, any non-trivial special cases where it will be?\"\n\nSo the problem is two-part: determine the possibility in general, and if not, find special cases.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were specific to the problem. For the current problem, the key assumptions are the 3D object, free rotation, projections on three axes. The problem is to prove whether such a rotation exists for any object, and if not, find special cases.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions like n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more general. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The object is a three-dimensional shape.\n- The object can be rotated in three-dimensional space.\n- Projections are considered along the x, y, and z axes.\n\nProblem: Determine whether any three-dimensional object can be rotated such that its projections along the x, y, and z axes are equal. If not, identify non-trivial special cases where this is possible.\n\nBut the original problem's title is about fitting inside a cube so it touches all sides. So perhaps the cube's side length is determined by the projections? If the object is rotated so that all projections are equal, then the minimal cube containing it would have sides equal to that projection length, and the object touches all sides. So the problem is equivalent to finding such a rotation.\n\nSo the formatted problem should include the cube fitting as part of the problem statement. Let me adjust.\n\nProblem: Determine whether any three-dimensional object can be rotated such that it can be fitted inside a cube with all its sides touched, i.e., its projections along the x, y, and z axes are equal. If not, identify non-trivial special cases where this is possible.\n\nBut the original 2D argument uses the Intermediate Value Theorem as you rotate the shape, leading to a point where x and y projections are equal. For 3D, we need to equalize three projections. This is more complex. Maybe using topological arguments like the Borsuk-Ulam theorem? The problem might not always be possible, hence needing to address special cases.\n\nBut the user wants the assumptions and problem structured. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe object is a three-dimensional shape.\nThe object can be freely rotated in three-dimensional space.\nThe projections of the object are measured along three orthogonal axes (x, y, z).\nThe cube's side length is determined by the maximum projection length along each axis.\n\nProblem: Determine whether any three-dimensional object can be rotated to fit inside a cube such that it touches all six sides (i.e., its projections along the x, y, and z axes are equal). If not always possible, identify non-trivial special cases where it is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cube is given, and the object must fit inside it, but the original question seems to be about fitting the object inside a cube (possibly scaled) such that it touches all sides. So the cube's size is adjusted based on the object's projections. The key is the existence of a rotation where projections are equal.\n\nHence, the problem is about the existence of a rotation making the three projections equal, regardless of the cube's size. So the cube's size is determined after rotation. The problem is whether such a rotation exists.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe object is a three-dimensional shape.\nThe object is rotated in three-dimensional space.\nProjections of the object are considered along three mutually orthogonal axes.\nProblem:\nProve whether any three-dimensional object can be rotated such that its projections along all three orthogonal axes are equal. If not, identify non-trivial special cases where such a rotation exists.",
