    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: prove that if two matrices can be transformed one into another using row-echelon transformation, then they are connected. as we focus on elements of $SL_n$, we only need to prove that transvections $L_i \\to l_i + aL_j$ connect elements. let $A\\in SL_n$, $B$ is the image of $A$ under the transvection $L_i \\to L_i + aL_j$. Then\n$$\n\\gamma: [0,1]\\to SL_n\n$$defined by\n\"$\\gamma(t)$ is the image of $A$ under the transvection  $L_i \\to L_i + taL_j$\n\" is continuous, and such as $\\gamma(0) = A$, $\\gamma(1) = B$ (also, check that for every $t$, $\\gamma (t)\\in SL_n$).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the question about proving that SL(n, R) is connected. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is asking to prove that the special linear group SL(n, R) is connected. The user mentions they know some topology from Munkres and are starting with fundamental groups. So, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. \n\nLooking at the problem, SL(n, R) is the set of n×n real matrices with determinant 1. The key properties here are that it's a group under matrix multiplication, it's a topological group, and we need to connect any two matrices in it with a continuous path. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the set of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- The topology on SL(n, R) is the subspace topology induced from the Euclidean space of matrices.\n\nWait, does the problem explicitly mention the topology? The user says they're using Munkres, which usually assumes the standard Euclidean topology. But the problem statement just says \"Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\" So maybe the assumptions are about the group and the topological structure. Let me check the example given. In the example, assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about SL(n, R), so the main assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and SL(n, R) is considered with its standard topology as a matrix group. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n3. SL(n, R) is equipped with the subspace topology from the Euclidean space of matrices.\n\nBut does the problem mention the topology explicitly? The user's question mentions topological groups, so maybe the assumption is that SL(n, R) is a topological group under the standard topology. However, the problem as stated just says \"Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\" So perhaps the assumptions are implicit. The example given in the format had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. In this case, the problem is about SL(n, R), so n is a positive integer, and SL(n, R) is defined as matrices with det 1. Maybe the key assumptions are just the definition of SL(n, R) and that n is a positive integer. The topology is part of the structure of SL(n, R) as a Lie group, but perhaps the user assumes standard topology. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n\nBut the problem is about connectedness, which is a topological property. So the topology is essential. The problem statement probably assumes the standard topology on SL(n, R) as a subspace of R^{n²}. Therefore, the assumptions should include that SL(n, R) has the subspace topology from R^{n²}. However, in the example given, the original problem had an expression and the assumptions were about n. Here, the problem is about the connectedness of SL(n, R), so the key assumptions are the definition of SL(n, R) and the topology. So to list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- SL(n, R) is equipped with the standard Euclidean topology as a subspace of R^{n²}.\n\nBut maybe the third point is implicit when considering matrix groups. However, to be precise, since connectedness is a topological property, we need to state the topology. But in the original problem statement, the user didn't mention the topology, just asked to prove it's connected. So maybe the assumptions are just the first two. However, the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's hypothesis. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user added assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that example might be incorrect. Wait, let me check again. \n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to modify the problem. Hmm, that's confusing. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Anyway, back to the current problem. The user wants to format the problem as Assumptions and Problem. The original question is to prove SL(n, R) is connected. The assumptions would be the basic conditions given. Since the problem is general, the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, and SL(n, R) is the group of matrices with determinant 1. The topology is part of the structure but maybe not explicitly stated. But since connectedness is topological, the assumption of the topology is necessary. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- SL(n, R) is considered as a topological space with the subspace topology inherited from R^{n²}.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because when you talk about connectedness, it's implied that you have a topology. However, to be explicit, it's better to include it. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that SL(n, R) is a Lie group, but the user might not know that. The user mentions knowing topological groups from Munkres, which typically uses subspace topology. So I think the three assumptions are correct. But let me check again the example. In the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. Maybe the example is incorrect. So perhaps the user's example is not a good model. Therefore, maybe in this case, the assumptions should just be the definition of SL(n, R) and that n is a positive integer, since the original problem says \"Prove that SL(n, R) is connected\" without additional conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\n\nBut since connectedness is a topological property, the topology must be specified. But in the problem statement, it's not mentioned. However, in standard mathematical contexts, SL(n, R) is considered with the subspace topology from R^{n²}. So maybe the third assumption is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's considered part of the definition of SL(n, R) as a topological group. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the topological group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1, equipped with the subspace topology.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify \"topological\", but the user is asking about connectedness, which is topological. So to make it clear, the assumptions should include that SL(n, R) is considered as a topological space with the standard topology. Therefore, three assumptions. However, in the example, the assumptions were two, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. So maybe the example is wrong, and I should focus on the current problem. Therefore, I'll proceed with:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- SL(n, R) is equipped with the subspace topology from the Euclidean space of n×n real matrices.\n\nProblem: Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because when you talk about connectedness, you need a topology, and SL(n, R) as a matrix group is naturally given the subspace topology. So perhaps the user considers it implicit. However, to be thorough, including it might help. But the example didn't include implicit assumptions, like in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is an integer (which is redundant, but listed as an assumption). So following that pattern, perhaps list the assumptions even if they seem part of the problem statement. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the set of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n- The topology on SL(n, R) is the subspace topology induced by the Euclidean topology on R^{n²}.\n\nProblem: Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\n\nBut maybe that's over-specifying. Alternatively, the problem is to prove that SL(n, R) is connected as a topological group. But the user didn't specify that. Given the user's knowledge level (Munkres topology), they likely assume the standard topology. So maybe the third assumption is not necessary. Let's check standard formatting. In the example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption added that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is not a good guide. So in the current case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- SL(n, R) is the group of n×n real matrices with determinant 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that SL(n, R) is connected.\n\nBecause the problem statement is just that. The user mentions they know topological groups from Munkres, so the topology is part of the group structure. Therefore, the assumptions are n is a positive integer and the definition of SL(n, R). The topology is part of the group's structure as a topological group. Hence, the formatted problem would be as above.",
