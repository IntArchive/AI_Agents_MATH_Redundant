    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: $T$ is continuous if and only if $\\ker T$ is closed Let $T: X\\to \\mathbf{R}$ be linear. Suppose that $X$ is a Banach space. I want to show that $T$ is continuous if and only if $\\ker T $ is closed. My Attempt. $(\\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $T$ is continuous. Then if $x_n\\to x$, then $T(x_n)\\to T(x)$. Let $x_n \\in \\ker T$. Then $T(x_n) = 0$. Using continuity, $$ T(x) = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} T(x_n) = 0.$$ Hence $x\\in \\ker T$ and thus $\\ker T$ is closed. $(\\Leftarrow)$  Suppose $T$ is not continuous. So $T$ is not bounded. i.e. $\\exists$ a sequence $x_n$ such that $T(x_n) \\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Let $a\\notin \\ker T$. Then defining $$x_n' = a - \\frac{T(a)}{T(x_n)}x_n ,$$ it is clear that $T(x_n') = 0$ and so $x_n'\\in \\ker T$. Also $x_n' \\to a \\notin \\ker T.$ So $\\ker T$ is not closed.  Hence $\\ker T$ closed implies that $T$ is continuous. Have I approached this question correctly? Are there other ways of approaching it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It looks good, and is the typical argument, except for two things, one of which is minor: In the first argument, after you say \"let $x_n\\in\\text{Ker}\\,T$\", you also need to add \"and $x_n\\rightarrow x$\". The previous sentence does not give that to you. The more egregious error:\nIn the second argument, you need to state that there is a bounded sequence $(x_n)$ such that $|T(x_n)|\\rightarrow\\infty$; that is, there is a sequence $(x_n)$ with $\\Vert x_n\\Vert \\le 1$ (say) with $|T(x_n)|\\rightarrow \\infty$. (And you might want to justify this; though, it's almost automatic from the definition of boundedness.) Without the boundedness of the $x_n$, you would not be guaranteed that the sequence $(x_n')$ converges to $a$. There is a somewhat quicker route for the forward implication: $\\{0\\}$ is closed in $\\Bbb R$, so, since $T$ is continuous, $T^{-1}(\\{0\\})$ is closed in $X$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and filter out any unnecessary information. The question is about showing that the kernel of a linear operator T is closed if and only if T is continuous. The user also provided their attempt and is asking if their approach is correct and if there are other methods.\n\nStarting with the assumptions. The problem involves a linear operator T from a Banach space X to the real numbers R. The key conditions here are linearity of T, the space X being a Banach space, and the properties related to continuity (boundedness) of T. The user is trying to prove an equivalence between T being continuous and ker T being closed. \n\nLet me list the assumptions one by one. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nFirst, T is a linear operator. That's one assumption. Then, the domain of T is X, which is a Banach space. So X is a Banach space. The codomain of T is the real numbers R. The problem is about the kernel of T being closed if and only if T is continuous. The original problem doesn't mention any specific restrictions beyond these. Wait, the user mentions that X is a Banach space, so that's an assumption. The operator T is linear. The problem is to show equivalence between ker T closed and T being continuous. \n\nSo the assumptions are:\n- T is a linear operator.\n- X is a Banach space.\n- The codomain of T is R.\n\nWait, the codomain being R might be important because the closedness of the kernel in a Banach space, and the continuity (boundedness) of linear operators into R (which is a complete space) might play a role. But in the problem statement, the user just wrote \"Let T: X→ R be linear. Suppose that X is a Banach space.\" So those are the given conditions. The problem is to show T is continuous iff ker T is closed. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n- T is a linear operator from X to R.\n- X is a Banach space.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem statement is to show that ker T is closed if and only if T is continuous.\n\nSo putting this into the required format:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear operator from X to R,\nX is a Banach space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ker T is closed if and only if T is continuous.\n\nNow, checking the example provided by the user. The original example had assumptions listed line by line, each being a single condition. The problem was stated concisely. Here, the user's original problem is about proving an equivalence between continuity of T and closedness of its kernel. The assumptions are linearity of T, X being Banach, and T mapping to R. Wait, in the example, the user included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but in the original problem here, the user hasn't added any extra assumptions beyond what's given. So in this case, the key assumptions are T is linear, X is Banach, and codomain is R. However, the problem statement in the original question might not explicitly mention that X is Banach in the title, but the question body does. So we need to extract that.\n\nI need to ensure that all necessary assumptions from the original problem are included. The problem statement says \"Let T: X→ R be linear. Suppose that X is a Banach space.\" So these are the given conditions. Therefore, those are the assumptions. The problem is to show the equivalence. \n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a linear operator from X to R,\nX is a Banach space.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ker T is closed if and only if T is continuous.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line. The problem statement is as above. This matches the structure required. The user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, then the problem. In this case, the assumptions are about T and X.\n\nAnother check: the original problem's title mentions \"T is continuous if and only if ker T is closed\". The user's question starts by stating that, and their attempt. The key elements are linearity of T, X being Banach, and the codomain being R. So yes, those are the assumptions. The problem is to prove the equivalence. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should correctly list the assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
