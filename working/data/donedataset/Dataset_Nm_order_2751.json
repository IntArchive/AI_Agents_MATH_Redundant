    "Content": "This is a question from Linear Algebra Done Right . Suppose $e_1, \\dots, e_n$ is an orthonormal basis of $V$ and $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ are vectors in $V$ such that\n$$ \\| e_j - v_j \\| < \\frac{1} {\\sqrt{n}} $$\nfor each $j$. Prove that $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ is a basis of $V$.\nI tried to show this if $V$ is a two dimensional space by contradiction. However, it seems too messy to use the same idea for a general case. Does anyone have hints for this problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Thanks to one of the students in my group, I actually solved it a few days ago. The idea is similar to one of the comments. I put my solution here since it is more on linear algebra side without touching matrix. We prove by contradiction. Assume otherwise, i.e. the set $\\{v_i\\}$ is not a basis for $V$. Then there exits some $w \\in V$, such that $\\langle w, v_i\\rangle = 0$ for every $i = 1, \\dots, n$ where $w \\neq 0$. Such $w$ can be chosen from the annihilator of $\\text{span}\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$. Since we know $\\dim( \\text{span}\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}) < n$, $w$ always exists. Then\n      \\begin{align*}\n    \\|e_i - v_i\\|^2 \\|w\\|^2 &\\ge | \\langle e_i-v_i, w\\rangle |^2 && (\\text{Cauchy-Schwarz}) \\\\\n                        &= | \\langle e_i, w\\rangle - \\langle v_i, w\\rangle |^2 \\\\\n                        &= | \\langle e_i, w\\rangle|^2\n  \\end{align*}\n      Now summing over $i = 1, \\dots, n$, we get\n      \\begin{align*}\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\| e_i - v_i\\|^2 \\|w\\|^2 &\\ge \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\langle e_i, w\\rangle)^2 \\\\\n                                          &= \\|w\\|^2\n  \\end{align*}\n      This implies $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\|e_i - v_i\\|^2 \\ge 1$. On the other hand, by assumption, $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\|e_i-v_i\\|^2 < 1$. This is a contradiction. Hence, $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$ must be a basis.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that a set of vectors close to an orthonormal basis is linearly independent, hence a basis. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n1. The problem states that e_1, ..., e_n is an orthonormal basis of V. So that's one assumption: the e_j form an orthonormal basis.\n\n2. The vectors v_1, ..., v_n are in V. That's another assumption: each v_j is in V.\n\n3. The condition given is that the norm of e_j - v_j is less than 1/sqrt(n) for each j. So each pair e_j and v_j is close in this norm sense.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for each j,\" so each v_j satisfies ||e_j - v_j|| < 1/sqrt(n). That's one condition per vector v_j. So each v_j is close to the corresponding e_j.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- e_1, ..., e_n is an orthonormal basis of V.\n- v_1, ..., v_n are vectors in V.\n- For each j, ||e_j - v_j|| < 1/sqrt(n).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that v_1, ..., v_n is a basis of V. \n\nWait, the original problem's title mentions \"linear independence,\" but the actual question is to prove that they form a basis. Since in a finite-dimensional space, if you have n vectors and the dimension is n, then linear independence implies they are a basis. So maybe the key is to show they are linearly independent, which would suffice.\n\nBut the problem as stated just says \"prove that v_1,...,v_n is a basis.\" So the formatted problem should have those assumptions and that problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example, in the assumption, each line is a single condition. So in the example, the user split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, similarly, maybe each assumption is a separate line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\ne_1, ..., e_n is an orthonormal basis of V,\nv_1, ..., v_n are vectors in V,\nfor each j, ||e_j - v_j|| < 1/√n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that v_1, ..., v_n is a basis of V.\n\nI think that's correct. The user in the example included specific mathematical conditions, so here, the key conditions are the orthonormal basis, the vectors being in V, and the norm condition. Each on separate lines. The problem is to prove they form a basis. That should be it.",
