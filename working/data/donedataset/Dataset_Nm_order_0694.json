    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given integral problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. First, I need to parse the original question and filter out any unrelated information. The original title and question mention an integral from -1 to 1 of a certain function, and they conjecture that it equals a specific expression involving the Gamma function cubed. The user also notes that Mathematica gives a complicated expression with hypergeometric functions, but they want to prove the simpler form given.\n\nSo, the task here is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Looking at the problem, the integral is from -1 to 1, and the integrand involves a cube root of (9 + 4√5 x) and (1 - x²) raised to the -2/3 power. The answer is supposed to involve Γ(1/3)^3. \n\nFirst, the assumptions. What are the key conditions here? The limits of integration are from -1 to 1, which is an important condition. The integrand has specific forms: the denominator is the cube root of 9 + 4√5 x multiplied by (1 - x²)^{2/3}. Also, the user mentions that the cube root of 9 + 4√5 is φ² (the golden ratio squared), which might be a hint or a substitution point, but since it's given as a note, maybe it's part of the problem's conditions. However, the problem statement itself doesn't include this as an assumption; it's more of a note. So perhaps the assumptions are the limits of integration and the form of the integrand.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is evaluated. Since the integral is definite from -1 to 1, and the integrand is as given. The problem doesn't state any particular conditions on variables because it's a definite integral with specific bounds. However, sometimes in integrals, certain conditions are necessary for convergence or to apply a particular method. But in this case, the integrand's denominator has (1 - x²)^{2/3}, which is well-defined for x in (-1,1) since 1 - x² is positive there, and the cube roots are okay. So maybe the key assumption is that the integral is over the interval [-1, 1]. Also, the integrand's structure is given, so maybe each component of the integrand is an assumption. But according to the example, each assumption line is about a property applied to one object. \n\nIn the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is an integral, so perhaps the assumptions are the interval of integration and the form of the integrand. But how to break that into separate lines? Let's see:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1,\nThe integrand is 1 divided by the cube root of (9 + 4√5 x) multiplied by (1 - x²)^{-2/3}.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that this integral equals the given Gamma function expression. So in the assumptions, we list the conditions of the integral. Each assumption is one property. The first assumption is the interval of integration. The second is the form of the integrand. However, maybe splitting the integrand into its components. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is -1,\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\nThe integrand contains the factor (9 + 4√5 x)^{-1/3},\nThe integrand contains the factor (1 - x²)^{-2/3}.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The integral's bounds are two separate lines? Or maybe the interval [-1,1] as a single assumption. The example had two separate lines for n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the integral's limits are part of the problem's setup. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [-1, 1],\nThe integrand is [1 / ( (9 + 4√5 x)^{1/3} (1 - x²)^{2/3} ) ].\n\nBut maybe even more broken down. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable is x,\nThe lower limit of integration is x = -1,\nThe upper limit of integration is x = 1,\nThe integrand is 1 divided by the cube root of (9 + 4√5 x),\nThe integrand is multiplied by (1 - x²)^{-2/3}.\n\nBut the example didn't break down variables like that. The key is to list assumptions that are necessary for the problem. Since the integral is definite, the bounds are part of the problem statement. The integrand's form is given. The user also mentions that the cube root of 9+4√5 is φ², but that's perhaps a hint or a property to use, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's bounds and the form of the integrand. But how to structure them? Let me look at the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the original problem, it was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that. Wait, that might have been a mistake. Wait, let me check. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the example has an error. Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and 91=13*7, so perhaps the problem actually requires that n is an integer (without divisibility by 7), but the formatted problem incorrectly added the assumption. Hmm, perhaps that's a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's example, they split the problem's original conditions into assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But then the formatted problem also added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But I have to follow the user's example structure.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is definite, so the assumptions are the integral's bounds and the integrand's form. The problem is to prove the equality. So applying the example's approach, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1,\nThe integrand is 1 divided by the cube root of (9 + 4√5 x) multiplied by (1 - x²) raised to the power of -2/3.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is one line, one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable is x,\nThe lower limit of integration is -1,\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\nThe integrand includes the term (9 + 4√5 x)^{-1/3},\nThe integrand includes the term (1 - x^2)^{-2/3}.\n\nBut is that necessary? The problem states the integral, so maybe the integral's definition is part of the problem, and the assumptions are the conditions under which the integral is considered. But since it's a definite integral with specific integrand, perhaps the assumptions are the integral setup. But the example might suggest that the problem is restated with the necessary conditions as assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the given conditions in the problem statement. In this case, the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are inherent in the integral's expression. However, the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, but maybe the user intended to show filtering of information. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user added an extra condition. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it. Hmm. But in any case, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem by filtering unrelated info and listing assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from -1 to 1, the integrand is 1 over [ (9 + 4√5 x)^{1/3} (1 - x²)^{2/3} ]. The problem is to prove this equals the Gamma expression. The note mentions that √[3]{9 + 4√5} = φ², which might be useful but isn't part of the assumptions. The problem doesn't state any other conditions; the integral is definite, so the variables are integrated out. Therefore, the assumptions would be the integral's bounds and the integrand's form. So, following the example's structure:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval [-1, 1],\nThe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{9+4\\sqrt{5}\\,x} \\cdot (1 - x^2)^{2/3}}$.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from x = -1 to x = 1,\nThe integrand contains the factor $(9 + 4\\sqrt{5}\\,x)^{-1/3}$,\nThe integrand contains the factor $(1 - x^2)^{-2/3}$.\n\nAlternatively, combine the integrand parts:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{9+4\\sqrt{5}\\,x} \\cdot (1 - x^2)^{2/3}}$,\nThe limits of integration are x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nBut the example had two separate assumptions for n being integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, the user expects each part of the integrand and the limits as separate assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions split into the limits and each component of the integrand.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to compute the integral as given, so the assumptions are the integral's definition. But perhaps the user wants each mathematical component as a separate assumption. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is -1,\nThe upper limit of integration is 1,\nThe denominator of the integrand includes $\\sqrt[3]{9 + 4\\sqrt{5}\\,x}$,\nThe denominator of the integrand includes $(1 - x^2)^{2/3}$.\n\nThus, each part of the integral's setup is an assumption. The problem is then to prove the integral equals the given Gamma expression. Therefore, following this approach, the assumptions are the integral's limits and each part of the integrand's denominator. That would match the example where multiple conditions are split.\n\nSo, final formatting:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated from x = -1 to x = 1,\nThe integrand includes the term $(9 + 4\\sqrt{5}\\,x)^{-1/3}$,\nThe integrand includes the term $(1 - x^2)^{-2/3}$.\nProblem: \nProve that\n$${\\large\\int}_{-1}^1\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt[3]{9+4\\sqrt5\\,x}\\ \\left(1-x^2\\right)^{2/3}}=\\frac{3^{3/2}}{2^{4/3}\\,5^{5/6}\\,\\pi }\\Gamma^3\\!\\!\\left(\\tfrac13\\right).$$\n###",
