    "Content": "How does one prove the following identity? $$\\int _Vf(\\pmb{r})\\delta (g(\\pmb{r})) \\, d\\pmb{r}=\\int_S \\frac{f(\\pmb{r})}{\\left|\\operatorname{grad} g(\\pmb{r})\\right|} \\, d\\sigma$$ where $S$ is the surface inside $V$ where $g(\\pmb{r})=0$ and it is assumed that $\\operatorname{grad} g(\\pmb{r})\\neq 0$ . Thanks. Edit: I have proved a one-dimensional version of this formula: $$\\delta (g(x))=\\sum _a \\frac{\\delta (x-a)}{\\left|g'(a)\\right|}$$ where $a$ goes through the zeroes of $g(x)$ and it is assumed that at those points $g'(a)\\neq 0$ . the integral can be divided into into a sum of integrals over small intervals containing the zeros of $g(x)$ . In these intervals $g(x)$ can be approximated by $g(a)+(x-a)g'(a)=(x-a)g'(a)$ since $g(a)=0$ . Thus $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\delta (g(x)) \\, dx=\\sum _a \\int _{a-\\varepsilon}^{a+\\varepsilon }f(x)\\delta ((x-a)g'(a)) \\, dx$$ Using the property $\\delta (kx)=\\frac{\\delta (x)}{|k|}$ , it follows that $$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)\\delta (g(x)) \\, dx=\\sum _a \\frac{f(a)}{\\left|g'(a)\\right|}$$ This is the same result we would have obtained if we had written $\\sum _a \\frac{\\delta (x-a)}{\\left|g'(a)\\right|}$ instead of $\\delta (g(x))$ as a factor of the integrand.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Try replacing $\\delta(x)$ with $\\varphi_\\epsilon(x)=\\varphi(x/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon$, where $\\varphi$ is a positive function of compact support and whose integral is $1$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the assumptions into individual points and then stating the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving an identity involving the Dirac delta function in n-dimensional space. The integral over a volume V of f(r) times delta(g(r)) equals the integral over the surface S (where g(r)=0) of f(r) divided by the magnitude of the gradient of g(r), with the condition that the gradient of g(r) isn't zero on S.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were listed one per line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object. So here, the problem mentions a few key points: S is the surface inside V where g(r)=0, and grad g(r) ≠ 0. Those are two separate assumptions. Also, maybe the fact that f is a function defined on V, but the user might not consider that an assumption since it's part of the integral's setup.\n\nWait, the problem states \"where S is the surface inside V where g(r)=0\" and \"it is assumed that grad g(r) ≠ 0\". So those are two conditions. Also, in the one-dimensional case, they mention that g'(a) ≠ 0 at the zeros, which is similar to the gradient condition here. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. S is the surface within V defined by g(r) = 0.\n2. The gradient of g(r) is non-zero on S (i.e., grad g(r) ≠ 0 for all r in S).\n\nAdditionally, the problem might assume that f is a suitable function (like continuous or integrable), but the original problem doesn't specify that, so maybe we shouldn't include it unless it's explicitly stated. The user's example didn't include implicit assumptions like the function being integrable, only the ones mentioned in the problem.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- S is the surface inside V where g(𝐫) = 0.\n- The gradient of g(𝐫) is non-zero for all points on S.\n\nEach of these addresses a single property. The first defines S, the second the non-vanishing gradient. The problem then is to prove the integral identity as stated.\n\nI should check if there are any other conditions. The original problem says \"it is assumed that grad g(r) ≠ 0\", so that's one assumption. The surface S is part of the problem's setup, so that's another. The user might have other implicit assumptions, but according to the example, only the explicitly mentioned ones are listed.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list these two assumptions, each on their own line, and then the problem statement.",
