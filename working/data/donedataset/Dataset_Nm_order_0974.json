    "Content": "Prove that if $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is such that $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ for all $x,y$, and $f$ is continuous at $0$, then it is continuous everywhere. If there exists $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(c) = 0$, then\n$$f(x + c) = f(x)f(c) = 0.$$\nAs every real number $y$ can be written as $y = x + c$ for some real $x$, this function is either everywhere zero or nowhere zero. The latter case is the interesting one. So let's consider the case that $f$ is not the constant function $f = 0$. To prove continuity in this case, note that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n$$f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x)f(0) \\implies f(0) = 1.$$ Continuity at $0$ tells us that given any $\\varepsilon_0 > 0$, we can find $\\delta_0 > 0$ such that $|x| < \\delta_0$ implies\n$$|f(x) - 1| < \\varepsilon_0.$$ Okay, so let $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be fixed arbitrarily (recall that $f(c)$ is nonzero). Let $\\varepsilon > 0$. By continuity of $f$ at $0$, we can choose $\\delta > 0$ such that\n$$|x - c| < \\delta\\implies |f(x - c) - 1| < \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}.$$ Now notice that for all $x$ such that $|x - c| < \\delta$, we have\n$$\\begin{align*}\n|f(x) - f(c)| &= |f(x - c + c) - f(c)|\\\\\n &= |f(x - c)f(c) - f(c)|\\\\\n &= |f(c)| |f(x - c) - 1|\\\\\n &\\lt |f(c)| \\frac{\\varepsilon}{|f(c)|}\\\\ \n &= \\varepsilon.\n\\end{align*}$$\nHence $f$ is continuous at $c$. Since $c$ was arbitrary, $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. Is my procedure correct?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One easier thing to do is to notice that $f(x)=(f(x/2))^2$ so $f$ is positive, and assume that it is never zero, since then the function is identically zero. Then you can define $g(x)=\\ln f(x)$ and this function $g$ will satisfy the Cauchy functional equation \n$$ g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$$\nand the theory for this functional equation is well known, and it is easy to see that $g$ is continuous if and only if it is continuous at $0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided includes breaking down the assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The problem is about proving that a function f: R → R, which satisfies f(x + y) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y and is continuous at 0, is continuous everywhere. The user also included their attempt, where they considered the cases where f is identically zero or not. They showed that if f is zero at some point c, then it's zero everywhere. Then, assuming f isn't zero everywhere, they derived that f(0) must be 1 and used the continuity at 0 to show continuity elsewhere by translating the argument to any point c.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The function f is defined from R to R. So, assumption: f: R → R.\n2. It satisfies the functional equation f(x + y) = f(x)f(y) for all x, y. So, another assumption: f(x + y) = f(x)f(y) for all real x, y.\n3. The function is continuous at 0. So, assumption: f is continuous at 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is continuous everywhere. The original problem statement mentions that if there's a c where f(c) = 0, then f is everywhere zero, but the main task is proving continuity under the given conditions. The user's question is about verifying their procedure, but the core problem to structure is the initial one: proving continuity everywhere given the functional equation and continuity at 0.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have the three assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement. The user's own steps and the check if their procedure is correct might be part of the original question on Math Stack Exchange, but the task here is to extract the problem's assumptions and the main problem to solve.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was included. However, in the original problem here, the assumptions are f: R→R, functional equation, and continuity at 0. There's no mention of f being non-zero or other conditions beyond the initial ones. The user's own reasoning brings up the case where f is zero, but the main problem doesn't have that as an assumption. So, the assumptions should be the three I listed above. The problem is to prove continuity everywhere. The user's steps are part of their solution attempt, which isn't part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf: ℝ → ℝ,\nf(x + y) = f(x)f(y) for all real x, y,\nf is continuous at 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is continuous everywhere.\n\nThat's it. The user's discussion about f(c)=0 leading to f being everywhere zero is part of their solution approach, not part of the problem's assumptions. The core problem is given the three assumptions, prove continuity everywhere. So, I need to ensure that I only include the problem's given conditions, not the user's reasoning steps.",
