    "Content": "Suppose $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ are independent and each has the same distribution with a sub-exponential random variable $X$ (for example, $X$ is the square of a standard normal Gaussian variable). Can I obtain a concentration inequality for the square of sub-exponential $X_i$ , say, $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left( X_1^2+\\cdots+X_n^2 \\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[X^2\\right] + t \\right) \\le C \\exp\\left( - n \\cdot \\min\\left( C_1 t^2, C_2 t, C_3 \\sqrt{t} \\right) \\right),$$ where $C, C_1, C_2, C_3$ are constants? This problem arises in my research. Remark: Actually, for i.i.d. sub-Gaussian random variables $Y_i\\ (i=1,\\ldots,n)$, I knew that $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left(Y_1+\\cdots+Y_n\\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y\\right] + t \\right) \\le \\exp\\left( - n\\cdot C_1 t^2 \\right).$$ Besides, since $Y_i^2\\ (i=1,2,\\ldots,n)$ are sub-exponential , I also knew that $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left(Y_1^2+\\cdots+Y_n^2\\right)\\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[ Y^2 \\right] + t \\right) \\le \\exp\\left( - n\\cdot \\min(C_1 t^2, C_2 t) \\right).$$ These two inequalities can be proved by a Chernoff bound, since the moment generating functions of $Y$ (sub-Gaussian) and $Y^2$ (sub-exponential) both exist. However, I want to know whether there is an inequality like $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left( Y_1^4+\\cdots+Y_n^4 \\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y^4\\right] + t \\right) \\le C \\exp\\left( - n \\cdot \\min\\left( C_1 t^2, C_2 t, C_3 \\sqrt{t} \\right) \\right),$$ even though the moment generating function of $Y^4$ (square of sub-exponential) does not exist.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No. For non-negative i.i.d. $Y_i$ , $$P(Y_1\\ge (\\mu+t)n)\\le P\\Bigg(\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\\ge (\\mu+t)n\\Bigg)\\le\\exp(-nf(t))$$ implies that $Y_1$ is sub-exponential and a square of a sub-exponential is not guaranteed to be sub-exponential. However you can obtain $$P(X_1^2+\\dots+X_n^2>nt)\\sim nP(X_1^2>nt)=n\\exp(-\\lambda\\sqrt {nt})$$ for $X_i\\sim \\exp(\\lambda)$ which you can extend to all subexponential $X_i$ that have exponential tails.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they gave involves breaking down assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then stating the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the provided example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Each assumption was on its own line. Then the problem was restated.\n\nNow, the current problem is from a question about concentration inequalities for sums of squares of sub-exponential variables. Let me parse through the original question.\n\nThe user mentions that X_1 to X_n are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. For example, X is the square of a standard normal variable. They want a concentration inequality for the average of their squares, specifically bounding the probability that this average exceeds the expectation plus t. The desired bound involves an exponential decay with minimum of terms like t², t, sqrt(t), scaled by constants and n.\n\nIn the assumptions, I need to list each condition. Let's break it down:\n\n1. X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent. That's one assumption.\n2. Each X_i has the same distribution as X. Another assumption.\n3. X is a sub-exponential random variable. Third assumption.\n4. The problem asks about the concentration of the sum of squares of X_i. But wait, the example given in the question is that X is the square of a standard normal, which would make X a chi-squared variable. However, the problem is about squares of sub-exponential variables. Wait, the question says \"square of sub-exponential X_i\". Wait, actually, the original variables X_i are sub-exponential, and the squares X_i^2 would then be sub-exponential squared. But sub-exponential variables have heavier tails than sub-Gaussian, but squaring them might lead to even heavier tails. But the user is comparing it to the case where Y_i are sub-Gaussian, then Y_i^2 are sub-exponential. Here, they have X_i which are sub-exponential, and considering X_i^2, which would be sub-exponential squared. The user wants a concentration inequality for the sum of squares of sub-exponential variables. The problem statement in the user's original question is to get a bound on P(1/n sum X_i^2 >= E[X^2] + t) with the specific form involving min(C1 t², C2 t, C3 sqrt(t)). \n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent.\n- Each X_i is identically distributed as X.\n- X is a sub-exponential random variable.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user gives an example where X is the square of a standard normal, which is a sub-exponential variable (since chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom is sub-exponential). So maybe that's part of the example, but not part of the general problem. The problem is more general: for any sub-exponential X, can we get this inequality for the squares. So in the assumptions, we don't need to include that X is the square of a standard normal, since that's just an example. The actual problem is about general sub-exponential variables. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent.\n2. Each X_i has the same distribution as X.\n3. X is a sub-exponential random variable.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each on one line. Then the problem is to prove the concentration inequality as stated. The user also mentions that they want to know if such an inequality holds even if the moment generating function of Y^4 (in their example) doesn't exist. But in the main problem, it's about squares of sub-exponential variables, so X_i^2. However, the user's example transitions to talking about Y_i^4 where Y is sub-Gaussian. But the main problem is about X_i^2 where X_i is sub-exponential.\n\nSo, structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nX_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent,\nEach X_i has the same distribution as X,\nX is a sub-exponential random variable.\n\nProblem: Determine if the inequality \n$$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left( X_1^2+\\cdots+X_n^2 \\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[X^2\\right] + t \\right) \\le C \\exp\\left( - n \\cdot \\min\\left( C_1 t^2, C_2 t, C_3 \\sqrt{t} \\right) \\right)$$\nholds, where $C, C_1, C_2, C_3$ are constants.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"Can I obtain a concentration inequality...\" so the problem is to prove or determine whether such an inequality holds. But in the example provided by the user, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here the problem statement would be \"Prove that the inequality holds...\" But in the original question, the user is asking whether such an inequality can be obtained. So maybe it's better to phrase it as \"Can the following inequality be established...\" or \"Determine if the following inequality holds...\".\n\nBut looking at the example, they rephrased the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem was \"Prove that...\" So maybe here, the problem statement should be \"Prove that the inequality...\" but since the user is asking whether such an inequality exists, perhaps the problem is \"Determine whether the inequality...\" However, the example's original problem was a \"Prove that...\" so maybe the user wants the problem statement to be phrased as a directive. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original question is \"Can I obtain a concentration inequality...\" which is a yes/no question with a request for the inequality. So perhaps the problem statement should be \"Obtain a concentration inequality for...\" or \"Prove that the following concentration inequality holds...\".\n\nBut the user's example extracted the key problem, even if the original question was a \"Prove that...\". Here, the user is asking to structure the problem, so the problem part should capture the core question. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that for the sum $$\\frac{1}{n} \\left( X_1^2+\\cdots+X_n^2 \\right)$$, the inequality $$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left( X_1^2+\\cdots+X_n^2 \\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[X^2\\right] + t \\right) \\le C \\exp\\left( - n \\cdot \\min\\left( C_1 t^2, C_2 t, C_3 \\sqrt{t} \\right) \\right)$$ holds, where $C, C_1, C_2, C_3$ are constants.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is asking whether such an inequality can be obtained, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Determine whether the inequality... holds\".\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as per the example, which converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" even though the original was also a \"Prove that...\". Here, the original question is a \"Can I obtain...\", which is a request for proof or disproof. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be stated as \"Prove or disprove that the inequality...\". But the example didn't have \"prove or disprove\", so maybe the user prefers it as \"Prove that...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to \"Obtain a concentration inequality...\", matching the original question. But given the example, it's better to follow the same structure. The example had \"Prove that...\".\n\nSo I think here, the problem should be \"Prove that the inequality... holds\", even though the original question is asking \"Can I obtain...\". Because the user's example restated the original problem as \"Prove that...\", even if the original was \"Prove that...\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX_1, X_2, ..., X_n are independent,\nEach X_i has the same distribution as X,\nX is a sub-exponential random variable.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\left( X_1^2+\\cdots+X_n^2 \\right) \\ge \\mathbb{E}\\left[X^2\\right] + t \\right) \\le C \\exp\\left( - n \\cdot \\min\\left( C_1 t^2, C_2 t, C_3 \\sqrt{t} \\right) \\right),$$ \nwhere $C, C_1, C_2, C_3$ are constants.\n\nBut wait, the original problem also mentions \"This problem arises in my research.\" and \"Remark: Actually, for i.i.d. sub-Gaussian...\" but those are part of the question's context, not the problem itself. So when structuring, we need to filter out those remarks and focus on the core problem. The user provided an example where they took the original problem, which had some text, and structured it into assumptions and problem. The key is to extract the mathematical problem, stripping away the remarks and examples.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the core is: given i.i.d. sub-exponential variables X_i, find concentration inequality for the average of their squares. The problem statement in the original question is asking for a specific form of the inequality. So the formatted problem should capture that request.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are as above, and the problem is to prove that such an inequality holds. So the answer should follow that structure.",
