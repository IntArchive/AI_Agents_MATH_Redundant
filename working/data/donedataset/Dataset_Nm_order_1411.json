    "AcceptedAnswer": "As noted, this integral is reducible to an elliptic integral and the form of the proposed solution may suggest that its modulus could be a singular value. Indeed, from the form \\begin{align}\n I&=2\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt {u^4+21u^2+112}} \\\\\n &=2\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt {u^2+\\frac{21}{2}+\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{4}}i}{\\sqrt {u^2+\\frac{21}{2}-\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{4}}i}}} \\\\\n &=2\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\sqrt {\\left(  u^2+u_+^2\\right)\\left( u^2+u_-^2 \\right)}} \n\\end{align} The opposite of the roots of the polynomial under the square root ( $u_{\\pm}^2=(21\\pm\\sqrt{7})/2$ ) are complex conjugate, as the coefficients of the polynomial are real. In the following, we first apply a Landen's transformation where these roots are replaced by their geometric and arithmetic means which are real. Defining $p=\\sqrt{u_+u_-}$ and $q=(u_++u_-)/2$ , we find from the coefficients of the polynomial \\begin{align}\n p^2&=\\sqrt{112}=4\\sqrt{7}\\\\\n q^2&=\\frac{1}{4}\\left( u_+^2+u_-^2+2u_+u_- \\right)\\\\\n &=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(21+2\\sqrt{112} \\right)=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(21+8\\sqrt{7} \\right)\n\\end{align} With $u=x+\\sqrt{x^2+p^2}$ , remarking that \\begin{equation}\n\\sqrt {\\left(  u^2+u_+^2\\right)\\left(u^2+u_-^2 \\right)}=2u\\sqrt{x^2+q^2}\n\\end{equation} and that \\begin{equation}\n du=\\frac{u}{\\sqrt{x^2+p^2}}\n\\end{equation} The integral becomes \\begin{equation}\n I=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{\\left( x^2+p^2 \\right)\\left( x^2+q^2 \\right)}}\n\\end{equation} Now, changing $x=q\\tan\\theta$ and taking into account the parity of the function, one obtains an integral representation of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind : \\begin{align}\n I&=2\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{p^2\\cos^2\\theta+q^2\\sin^2\\theta}}\\\\\n &=\\frac{2}{p}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{p^2-q^2}{p^2}\\sin^2\\theta}}\\\\\n &=\\frac{2}{p}\\mathbf{K}\\left( \\sqrt{1-\\frac{q^2}{p^2}} \\right)%\\\\\n %&=\\frac{2}{p}K'\\left( \\frac{q}{p} \\right)\n\\end{align} Now, $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{q^2}{p^2}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8}\\left( 3-\\sqrt{7} \\right)=\\lambda^*(7)$ , where $\\lambda^*(r)$ gives a singular value of the elliptic modulus $k_r$ for which $\\mathbf{K}\\left( \\sqrt{1-k_r^2} \\right)=\\sqrt{r}\\mathbf{K}(k_r)$ see here , here and here . Then, \\begin{align}\n I&=\\frac{2}{p}\\mathbf{K}\\left( k_7 \\right)\\\\\n &=\\frac{2}{2.7^{1/4}}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right)\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{2}{7} \\right)\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{4}{7} \\right)}{4\\pi 7^{1/4}}\\\\\n &=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right)\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{2}{7} \\right)\\Gamma\\left( \\frac{4}{7} \\right)}{4\\pi \\sqrt{7}}\n\\end{align} as expected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about evaluating a specific integral and showing it's equal to an expression involving gamma functions. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions an integral from 0 to infinity, so the variable t is integrated over the positive real numbers. The integrand is 1 over the square root of t times (t² + 21t + 112). So the assumptions here would involve the limits of integration and the form of the integrand. \n\nBut the example provided in the user's instruction shows that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So for this integral, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is 1 / √[t(t² + 21t + 112)].\n  \nAdditionally, the user did some substitution, changing variables from t to u where du = d√t, leading to transforming the integral into one involving u⁴ + 21u² + 112. However, the problem as stated in the title is to show the original integral equals the gamma function expression. The user's steps are part of their attempt, but the core problem is just the equality of the integral to that gamma product over 4π√7. So perhaps the substitution steps are part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should focus on the integral given in the title. So the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over t from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is 1 divided by the square root of t multiplied by (t² + 21t + 112).\n\nWait, but maybe the substitution is part of the problem's given conditions? The user mentions they did a substitution, but the problem as posed in the title is just the integral equals that gamma expression. So the problem is to prove that equality, regardless of the substitution steps. Therefore, the assumptions should only include the integral's structure and limits.\n\nSo, structured:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over t from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is 1 divided by the square root of t(t² +21t +112).\n\nProblem: Show that the integral equals (1/(4π√7))Γ(1/7)Γ(2/7)Γ(4/7).\n\nWait, but the user's example included in the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, the example might have been a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect, because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. Maybe that example was a wrong example. Hmm. So maybe in that case, the user's example was incorrect, and the actual assumptions should be n is an integer. But that's conflicting. The user might have made a mistake there, but for the current problem, I need to focus on the integral given.\n\nSo the problem is to show that the integral from 0 to infinity of 1 over sqrt(t(t² +21t +112)) dt equals that gamma product over 4π√7. Therefore, the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. So each assumption is one line. The first assumption is the integral variable t is integrated from 0 to ∞. The second assumption is the integrand's form. Alternatively, maybe split the integrand into parts? The integrand is 1 divided by sqrt(t(t² +21t +112)), so maybe that's one condition. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nt is integrated from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is 1 / √[t(t² + 21t + 112)].\n\nProblem: Show that the integral equals [given gamma expression].\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's substitution steps are part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the problem is as stated in the title, and the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand.",
