    "Content": "Let $x_1 = (44)^{1/2}$ and $x_{n+1} = (3x_n + 1)^{1/2}$ for $n\\geq 1$. Prove that $x_n$ is irrational for every $n\\geq 1$. I really have no idea how to proceed, I couldn't even find a nice closed form. I know $(44)^{1/2}$ is irrational, but what should I do. I would like a sketch of the proof and hints are greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that for some $n$, $x_n$ is rational. We know that $x_n=(3x_{n-1}+1)^{1/2}$. By algebra we have that $\\frac{1}{3}(x^2_n-1)=x_{n-1}$ and so we have that $x_{n-1}$ is also rational. By iterating this argument $n-1$ times we find out that $x_1$ is rational. However, you’ve already noted this isn’t true. Thus $x_n$ couldn’t have been rational. Since this applies for any $n$, there is no value of the sequence that is rational. To specifically phrase this as being induction, the base case is just noting that $44$ isn’t a perfect square. Now we need to prove the inductive hypothesis If $x_n$ is irrational then $x_{n+1}$ is irrational. This statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive If $x_{n+1}$ is rational then $x_n$ is rational. This contrapositive version is proven by my first paragraph, so since the contrapositive is true the original statement is true. Therefore by induction the entire sequence is irrational.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to structure the given problem into the specified format. The original question is about proving by induction that every term of a sequence is irrational. Let me parse through the details.\n\nFirst, the sequence is defined with x₁ = √44, and then each subsequent term is xₙ₊₁ = √(3xₙ + 1). The goal is to show that for every n ≥ 1, xₙ is irrational. The example provided in the format mentions listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the problem statement here, the user might not have made any explicit assumptions beyond the definitions. Wait, the problem states \"Prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥ 1\". The initial term is √44, which is irrational. The next term is √(3*√44 + 1). The user needs to structure the problem by extracting assumptions.\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n\n1. x₁ is defined as √44.\n2. For each n ≥ 1, xₙ₊₁ is defined as √(3xₙ + 1).\n3. The problem requires proving for every n ≥ 1, xₙ is irrational.\n\nBut wait, the example had separate lines for each assumption. In this case, the initial term is set, the recurrence relation is another, and the conclusion needed is another. But the problem statement doesn't have additional constraints, so maybe the assumptions are the definitions of the sequence. So each part of the definition would be an assumption. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nLet x₁ = √44 and x_{n+1} = √(3xₙ + 1) for n ≥ 1. Prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥ 1.\n\nSo the assumptions here are the definitions of x₁ and x_{n+1}, and the problem is to prove irrationality for all n ≥1.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- x₁ is equal to √44.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} is defined as the square root of (3xₙ + 1).\n\nWait, but each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ = √44,\nFor all integers n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = √(3xₙ + 1),\nn is an integer where n ≥ 1.\n\nBut the problem is to prove xₙ is irrational for every n ≥1. The example included in the user's instruction had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond the definition of the sequence. Therefore, the assumptions here are the definitions of the sequence. Each part of the definition is a separate assumption.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ is defined as (44)^{1/2},\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} is defined as (3xₙ + 1)^{1/2},\nn is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥1. The problem statement doesn't have any other hidden assumptions. Therefore, structuring as per the example, the assumptions are the initial condition and the recurrence relation. So each of those is an assumption. Also, maybe the fact that n is an integer ≥1 is another assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of those as separate assumptions. The problem is then the actual statement to prove.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. However, in that example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user might have mistakenly added that. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems like an error. Perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is from a different problem where n needs to be divisible by 7 for the divisibility by 91. For instance, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, perhaps the user mistakenly split it. Anyway, perhaps the example is just an illustration of the format, not necessarily accurate.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user needs to list the assumptions. So the assumptions here are the definitions of the sequence and the domain of n. So each line would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ = √44,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} = √(3xₙ + 1),\nn is an integer where n ≥ 1.\n\nBut maybe the third line is redundant since the second line already states \"for n ≥1\". But according to the example, each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property. So perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ is defined as (44)^{1/2},\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, x_{n+1} is defined as (3xₙ + 1)^{1/2},\nn is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"Prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥ 1\". Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nProblem: Prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥ 1.\n\nBut perhaps in the assumptions, since n is already covered in the recurrence definition. Wait, maybe the user doesn't need to list \"n is an integer\" because the problem is for every n ≥1, which is already part of the problem statement. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\". So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- x₁ = √44,\n- For each integer n ≥1, x_{n+1} = √(3xₙ +1).\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁ is defined as (44)^{1/2},\nFor each integer n ≥1, x_{n+1} is defined as (3xₙ + 1)^{1/2}.\n\nProblem: Prove that xₙ is irrational for every n ≥1.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line. The first defines x₁, the second defines the recurrence relation. The problem is to prove irrationality for all n ≥1. The fact that n is an integer is already covered in the second assumption. Therefore, this should be the formatted problem.",
