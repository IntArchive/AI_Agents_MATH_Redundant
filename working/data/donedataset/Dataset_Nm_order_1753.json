    "Content": "Let $ a $ , and $ b $ be real numbers.

Here is the reasoning I have followed so far: Trigonometric substitutions: I attempted to simplify the term $ a \\cos t + b \\sin t $ using the identity $ r \\cos(t - \\phi) $ , where $ r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $ and $ \\phi = \\arctan(b/a) $ . This seemed natural, but it led to complicated expressions in terms of $ t - \\phi $ , and I couldn't make significant progress. Change of variable: I considered a change of variable to take advantage of the symmetry of the interval $ [0, \\pi] $ , but it wasn’t clear how to simplify the square root in the numerator. Relation to the arccos function: I suspect that the result involves some key property of trigonometric functions and their relation to the arccos function, but I am unsure how to connect this to the integrand. This problem seems intriguing because it combines definite integrals, trigonometric terms, square roots, and inverse functions, suggesting there is an elegant simplification underlying it. I would appreciate any guidance on how to proceed or if there is a technique I might be overlooking.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user wants to show an integral identity involving trigonometric functions and square roots. The integral is from 0 to π, and the integrand looks pretty complicated. The result is supposed to be an arccos function of some expression involving a and b.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that a and b are real numbers. That's the first assumption. The integral is over t from 0 to π, so the variable of integration is t, and the limits are fixed. The integrand has expressions with a cos t + b sin t, which they tried to rewrite using a trigonometric identity. The user also mentioned trying variable substitution but didn't get far. \n\nWait, the assumptions should only list the given conditions in the problem, not the user's attempts. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. a and b are real numbers.\n2. The integral is taken over the interval [0, π].\n3. The integrand is a function involving sqrt(1 + (a cos t + b sin t)^2) plus a cos t + b sin t, squared, divided by 1 plus that square.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So for example, the first assumption is about a and b being real numbers. But in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. However, in the original problem here, the user hasn't specified any conditions on a and b except that they are real. So the main assumptions are:\n\n- a is a real number.\n- b is a real number.\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"Let a, and b be real numbers.\" So perhaps splitting that into two separate assumptions? But in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" as one line. Here, a and b are both real numbers. So maybe list them as two separate assumptions? Or perhaps as \"a and b are real numbers\" as one assumption. The example had \"n is an integer\" as one line. So maybe here, \"a and b are real numbers\" is one assumption. But the problem statement says \"Let a, and b be real numbers.\" So that's a single assumption about both a and b. So perhaps that's one assumption. Then the integral is from 0 to π, which is another assumption. Are there any other conditions? The integrand's structure is part of the problem, not an assumption. The problem is to show the equality. So the assumptions are just the given conditions: a and b are real, the integral is over [0, π]. \n\nWait, but in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was actually part of the original problem's conclusion. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it's the conclusion that the number is divisible by 91. So that seems like an error in the example. Because the original problem's assumption is only that n is an integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is incorrect. So maybe the example is wrong? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake there. But regardless, the task here is to structure the current problem as per the example's format, even if the example is flawed. \n\nBut in the current problem, the original question states \"Let a, and b be real numbers.\" So the assumptions are that a and b are real. The integral is from 0 to π. Are there any other assumptions? The problem is to show the integral equals arccos(-b / sqrt(1 + a² + b²)). The user didn't mention any other constraints. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a real number.\n2. b is a real number.\n3. The integral is computed over the interval [0, π].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a separate line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nthe integral is evaluated from t=0 to t=π.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the integral is already from 0 to π, so that's part of the problem's setup. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So the problem says \"Let a and b be real numbers. Show that [integral] equals arccos(...).\" So the assumptions are a and b are real numbers, and the integral is over [0, π]. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nthe integral is taken over the interval [0, π].\n\nBut maybe \"the integral is taken over the interval [0, π]\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, no—the problem states to compute the integral from 0 to π, so that's a condition of the problem. So it's an assumption about the limits of integration. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a real number.\n2. b is a real number.\n3. The integral is evaluated from t = 0 to t = π.\n\nThen the problem is to show that this integral equals the arccos expression.\n\nSo putting that together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\nthe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, π].\nProblem:\nShow that\n\\begin{equation}\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{1 + (a \\cos t + b \\sin t)^2} + a \\cos t + b \\sin t\\right)^2}{1 + \\left(\\sqrt{1 + (a \\cos t + b \\sin t)^2} + a \\cos t + b \\sin t\\right)^2} \\, dt = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{1 + a^2 + b^2}}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n###",
