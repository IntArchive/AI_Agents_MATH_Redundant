    "Content": "Apologies in advance that this is a somewhat vague question. I attempt to make precise below what would constitute an answer for me. Let $G$ be a topological group and $X$ a topological space on which $G$ acts as a set. I have in my mind two different definitions of the statement \" $G$ acts continuously on $X$ ,\" and I would like to know when they are equivalent. The real definition, per Wikipedia , is the assertion that the action map $$\\alpha: G\\times X \\rightarrow X$$ given by $$(g,x)\\mapsto gx$$ is a continuous map. This definition is very concise and conceptually slim. But the following alternative definition feels natural to me too, probably because it consists of the information I actually want to know about the action: For any $g\\in G$ , the map $\\rho_g:X\\rightarrow X$ given by $x\\mapsto gx$ is a homeomorphism, thus there is a natural group homomorphism $\\rho: G\\rightarrow \\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ given by $g\\mapsto \\rho_g$ , where $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is the group of homeomorphisms of $X$ . Endow $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ with the compact-open topology. Then $\\rho:G\\rightarrow \\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is a continuous map of topological spaces. I assume that these definitions are not equivalent at the generality of my setup, since if $X$ is a totally general topological space, I know that weird things can happen. For example, my impression is that $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ needn't be a topological group. (While I am unaware of a specific example, there is a theorem due to Richard Arens [Theorem 4 here ] stating that if $X$ is locally compact, locally connected hausdorff, then $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ with the compact-open topology is a topological group; so presumably this fails in greater generality. Of course, it is possible in principle that the definitions are equivalent even when $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is not a topological group.) On the other hand, the real definition does imply the alternative definition in full generality (see appendix below), and it seems likely to me that under some \"ordinary circumstances\" they will coincide. My question is: Under what topological conditions on $G$ and $X$ do the two above definitions of a continuous group action coincide with each other? This question is admittedly vague. I would be happy with any set of conditions sufficient for equivalence that are in the language of general (i.e., point-set) topology. For example, \"this is true if $G$ and $X$ are locally connected, locally compact hausdorff [or whatever]\" would be a satisfying answer, whereas, \"this is true if $G$ is a Lie group and $X$ is a manifold\" is narrower than what I am looking for. Appendix: proof that the standard definition implies the alternative one: Suppose that the action map $\\alpha:G\\times X\\rightarrow X$ is continuous. A \"cross-section embedding\" $X\\hookrightarrow G\\times X$ given, for a fixed $g$ , by $x\\mapsto (g,x)$ , is a continuous map. (An open set in $G\\times X$ is a union of sets $V\\times U$ , with $V\\subset G$ and $U\\subset X$ open, and the pullback in $X$ under this \"cross-section embedding\" will be the union of just those $U$ 's whose corresponding $V$ contains $g$ . This is a union of open sets, therefore open.) Therefore, fixing $g$ , the composite map $$ X\\hookrightarrow G\\times X \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} X $$ given by $$ x\\mapsto (g,x) \\mapsto gx$$ is continuous. This is the map $\\rho_g$ . It is inverse to $\\rho_{g^{-1}}$ , which is continuous for the same reason. Thus $\\rho_g$ is a homeomorphism for every $g$ , in full generality. Let $K,U\\subset X$ be compact and open, respectively, and let $[K,U]\\subset \\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ be the set of homeomorphisms $f:X\\rightarrow X$ satisfying $f(K)\\subset U$ . Then $\\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ consists of those $g\\in G$ such that $\\rho_g(K)\\subset U$ . I would like to know that $\\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ is open, since the $[K,U]$ 's form a subbase for the topology of $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ . Fix an arbitrary $g\\in \\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Let $k\\in K$ be arbitrary. Then $gk = \\rho_g(k)=\\alpha(g,k)\\in U$ , i.e., $(g,k)\\in\\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Since $\\alpha$ is continuous and $U$ is open, $\\alpha^{-1}(U)\\subset G\\times X$ is open, thus $(g,k)$ is contained in a basis open set of the product topology on $G\\times X$ that is entirely contained in $\\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Let it be $V_{gk}\\times U_{gk}$ , where $V_{gk}\\subset G$ and $U_{gk}\\subset X$ are open, and $g\\in V_{gk}$ while $k\\in U_{gk}$ . Keeping $g$ fixed while allowing $k$ to vary across $K$ , we get an open cover $\\{U_{gk}\\}|_{k\\in K}$ of $K$ . Since $K$ is compact, this cover has a finite subcover $U_{gk_1},\\dots,U_{gk_s}$ . Let $V=\\bigcap_1^s V_{gk_j}$ . Because this intersection is finite, $V$ is an open subset of $G$ . Since $V\\times U_{gk_j} \\subset V_{gk_j}\\times U_{gk_j}\\subset \\alpha^{-1}(U)$ for each $j=1,\\dots,s$ , we have $$ V\\times K \\subset V\\times \\bigcup_1^s U_{gk_j} = \\bigcup_1^s V\\times U_{gk_j} \\subset \\alpha^{-1}(U).$$ The first containment is because by construction, $U_{gk_1},\\dots,U_{gk_s}$ is a cover of $K$ . Translating the containment $V\\times K\\subset \\alpha^{-1}(U)$ in terms of $\\rho$ , this says that $V\\subset\\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Now clearly $g\\in V$ since $g\\in V_{gk_j}$ for each $j$ (in fact, $g\\in V_{gk}$ for each $k$ ). Thus we have identified an open set of $G$ containing $g$ and contained in $\\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Since $g$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ is open. Therefore, $\\rho$ is continuous. This proof that $\\rho$ is continuous is a direct adaptation of this proof given by Olivier Begassat in the special case that $X=G$ and the action is regular.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $X$ is locally compact hausdorff, then the two definitions are equivalent. Local connectedness appears not to be needed for this, nor do we appear to need any topological constraint on $G$ beyond the setup. We follow the notational conventions set up in the OP. Theorem: Assume $X$ is locally compact hausdorff. Then the following are equivalent: The action map $\\alpha:G\\times X\\rightarrow X$ is continuous. Each element action $\\rho_g:X\\rightarrow X$ (defined by $\\rho_g(x)=\\alpha(g,x)$ ) is continuous, and the induced representation map $\\rho:G\\rightarrow \\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ (defined by $g\\mapsto \\rho_g$ ) is continuous. Proof: It was already proven in the OP (without needing either the local compactness or the hausdorffness assumptions) that if $\\alpha$ is continuous, then $\\rho$ is continuous (and its image lands in $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ ). So, we suppose each $\\rho_g$ is continuous, and $\\rho$ is continuous, and $X$ is locally compact hausdorff, and aim to establish $\\alpha$ is continuous. Let $U\\subset X$ be open, and consider $\\alpha^{-1}(U)\\subset G\\times X$ . We have to show it is open. Take an arbitrary $(g,x)\\in \\alpha^{-1}(U)$ ; it will suffice to find an open set of $G\\times X$ containing $(g,x)$ and contained in $\\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Since by assumption $\\rho_g$ is continuous, the set $\\rho_g^{-1}(U)\\subset X$ is open. Note that it contains $x$ , because $(g,x)\\in\\alpha^{-1}(U)$ , or equivalently, $\\rho_g(x)\\in U$ . Since $X$ is locally compact hausdorff, $x$ has a local base of compact neighborhoods. In particular, there is a compact set $K$ contained in the open set $\\rho_g^{-1}(U)$ and containing an open set $U_x$ that in turn contains $x$ : $$x\\in U_x\\subset K\\subset \\rho_g^{-1}(U) \\subset X.$$ The set $[K,U]\\subset \\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is open, by definition of the topology on $\\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ . By supposition, $\\rho$ is continuous; therefore $\\rho^{-1}([K,U])\\subset G$ is open; call it $V$ . Since $K\\subset \\rho_g^{-1}(U)$ , i.e., $\\rho_g(K)\\subset U$ , we have that $g\\in \\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ ; in other words, $g\\in V$ . Thus $(g,x)$ is contained in $V\\times U_x$ . Meanwhile, by definition of $V$ , for any $h\\in V$ we have $\\rho_h(K)\\subset U$ , and in particular, $\\rho_h(U_x)\\subset U$ since $U_x\\subset K$ . It follows that the entirety of $V$ sends $U_x$ into $U$ ; in other words, $V\\times U_x\\subset \\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Now $V\\times U_x\\subset G\\times X$ is open by definition of the product topology, since $V\\subset G$ and $U_x\\subset X$ are open. Thus we have identified an open set $V\\times U_x$ containing $(g,x)$ and contained in $\\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . We conclude $\\alpha$ is continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking under what conditions on the topological group G and the topological space X the two definitions of a continuous group action are equivalent. \n\nFirst, let's recall the two definitions. The first one is the standard definition where the action map α: G×X → X is continuous. The second definition requires that each ρ_g is a homeomorphism and the homomorphism ρ: G → Homeo(X) is continuous when Homeo(X) has the compact-open topology.\n\nThe user already showed that the standard definition implies the alternative one in general, but wants to know when the converse is true. So the equivalence would mean that if we have a group action where each ρ_g is a homeomorphism and ρ is continuous into Homeo(X) with compact-open topology, then the action map α is continuous.\n\nTo structure the problem, I need to list all assumptions. The problem involves a topological group G acting on a topological space X. The two definitions need to be compared. The user mentions that Homeo(X) with compact-open topology might not be a topological group in general, but under certain conditions (like locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff) it is, due to Arens' theorem. So possible assumptions could relate to the properties of X (like locally compact, locally connected, Hausdorff) and G (like locally compact, etc.). \n\nThe problem is to find conditions on G and X such that the two definitions of continuous action are equivalent. The answer should specify topological conditions on both G and X. For example, maybe if X is locally compact Hausdorff and G is locally compact, then the equivalence holds. But I need to make sure each assumption is one property per line.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that in the alternative definition, ρ being continuous requires that the preimage of subbasic sets [K,U] in Homeo(X) are open in G. The proof provided shows that standard definition implies the alternative, but the reverse direction is what needs conditions. So the key is to see under what conditions a continuous homomorphism ρ: G → Homeo(X) (with compact-open topology) ensures the continuity of α: G×X → X.\n\nFrom general topology, when does the evaluation map Homeo(X)×X → X being continuous? If X is locally compact Hausdorff, the compact-open topology makes the evaluation map continuous. But here, we have G acting via ρ. So if Homeo(X) has the compact-open topology and the evaluation map is continuous, then α(g,x) = ρ(g)(x) would be continuous as a composition of ρ×id_X followed by evaluation. Therefore, if ρ is continuous and evaluation is continuous, then α is continuous. But evaluation is continuous if X is locally compact Hausdorff (by the properties of compact-open topology). So perhaps the condition is that X is locally compact Hausdorff. But also, we need that Homeo(X) is a topological group, which under Arens' theorem requires X to be locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff. So maybe the assumptions are that X is locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff and G is a topological group. Then, the two definitions are equivalent.\n\nBut the user wants the answer in the format where each assumption is one line, applied to one object. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n- X is locally connected.\n- The compact-open topology on Homeo(X) is a topological group.\n\nWait, but according to Arens' theorem, if X is locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff, then Homeo(X) with compact-open topology is a topological group. So maybe the assumptions are on X being locally compact, locally connected, and Hausdorff. Then, under these conditions, the two definitions are equivalent. But does that suffice?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the evaluation map is continuous, so that the composition G×X → Homeo(X)×X → X is continuous when ρ is continuous. Therefore, the equivalence would hold when X is locally compact Hausdorff. Wait, but the user's alternative definition already assumes that each ρ_g is a homeomorphism and ρ is a continuous homomorphism. So, if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the evaluation map is continuous, hence α is continuous. So perhaps the key assumption is X is locally compact Hausdorff.\n\nBut in the problem, the user is asking for conditions on both G and X. But maybe X being locally compact Hausdorff is sufficient regardless of G? Or does G need to be locally compact as well?\n\nAlternatively, in the literature, it's often the case that when X is locally compact Hausdorff, then continuity of the action can be checked via the continuity of the map G → Homeo(X) with compact-open topology. So the answer might be that if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the two definitions are equivalent. However, the user's own proof shows that the standard definition implies the alternative in full generality. So the other direction is the one needing conditions.\n\nTo get the reverse direction (alternative implies standard), we need that the map α is continuous. Given that ρ is continuous and each ρ_g is continuous, but to have α continuous, we need that the map (g,x) ↦ ρ(g)(x) is continuous. This is the evaluation map composed with ρ×id. So if ρ is continuous and the evaluation map is continuous, then α is continuous. The continuity of the evaluation map Homeo(X)×X → X in the compact-open topology holds when X is locally compact Hausdorff. Therefore, if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then evaluation is continuous, hence if ρ is continuous, then α is continuous. Therefore, the equivalence holds when X is locally compact Hausdorff. \n\nBut wait, the user mentions that Homeo(X) needs to be a topological group, but maybe that's not required here. The continuity of the evaluation map is separate. So perhaps the assumption is just X being locally compact Hausdorff. But let me verify.\n\nIn the compact-open topology, if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the evaluation map ev: Homeo(X)×X → X, ev(f,x)=f(x) is continuous. This is a standard result. Therefore, if we have a continuous map ρ: G → Homeo(X), then the action α(g,x) = ev(ρ(g),x) is continuous as the composition of ρ×id followed by ev. Therefore, if X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the alternative definition (continuous ρ) implies the standard definition (continuous α). So in this case, the two definitions are equivalent when X is locally compact Hausdorff. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions that they are looking for conditions on both G and X, possibly in the language of general topology. However, in this case, the key condition is on X. Maybe G is just any topological group. So the assumption is only on X.\n\nBut the user's example in the problem mentions that the answer could be \"if G and X are locally connected, locally compact Hausdorff\". But according to the logic above, maybe only X needs to be locally compact Hausdorff. Let me check.\n\nIn the proof that standard implies alternative, G can be any topological group and X any space. The reverse requires that ev: Homeo(X)×X → X is continuous, which holds if X is locally compact Hausdorff. So the condition is on X. Therefore, the answer is that X must be locally compact Hausdorff. \n\nBut maybe there's a need for G to be locally compact as well? For example, when considering the product topology on G×X, if G is not locally compact, the product topology might have different properties. However, the continuity of ev is independent of G; it's a property of X and Homeo(X). So as long as ev is continuous, then ρ continuous implies α continuous. Therefore, the key condition is X being locally compact Hausdorff. \n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the following two definitions of a continuous group action are equivalent:\n1. The action map α: G×X → X is continuous.\n2. Each ρ_g: X → X is a homeomorphism, and the homomorphism ρ: G → Homeo(X) (with compact-open topology) is continuous.\n\nWait, but the user wants to know under what conditions they are equivalent. The formatted problem should list the assumptions, then state the problem. But the user already knows that 1 implies 2 in general. The question is when 2 implies 1. So the problem is to find conditions under which the two definitions are equivalent (i.e., 1 ⇨ 2 always, and 2 ⇨ 1 under certain conditions). Therefore, the problem is to determine under what topological conditions on G and X does the continuity of ρ imply the continuity of α, hence making the two definitions equivalent.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the main condition is X being locally compact Hausdorff. Therefore, the assumptions would be X being locally compact Hausdorff, and G being a topological group. But the problem is to state when the two definitions coincide. So the formatted problem should list the conditions (assumptions) and then ask for the equivalence.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions are listed line by line, each applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nProve that the following two definitions of a continuous group action are equivalent:\n1. The action map α: G×X → X is continuous.\n2. Each ρ_g: X → X is a homeomorphism, and the homomorphism ρ: G → Homeo(X) (equipped with the compact-open topology) is continuous.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's question is to find the conditions, the problem would be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the two definitions of a continuous group action (as stated) are equivalent.\n\nBut maybe the user wants a more precise answer. Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as asking under what conditions on G and X the two definitions are equivalent, with the answer being when X is locally compact Hausdorff. But the problem format requires listing the assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps the assumptions include the conditions under which equivalence holds, and the problem is to prove equivalence under those assumptions. But in the example given by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem of proving divisibility by 91. Here, the user is asking for the conditions, so the problem is to state when the equivalence occurs.\n\nBut perhaps the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nProve that the two definitions of a continuous group action (as stated) are equivalent.\n\nBut the original question is to determine under what conditions they are equivalent. So perhaps the problem is to identify the conditions (i.e., state the required properties of G and X) and prove equivalence. However, given the user's example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (the conditions) and then state the problem to prove equivalence under those assumptions. So if the answer is that when X is locally compact Hausdorff, then the two definitions are equivalent, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a topological group.\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nProve that the following two definitions of a continuous group action by G on X are equivalent:\n1. The action map α: G×X → X is continuous.\n2. Each ρ_g: X → X is a homeomorphism, and the homomorphism ρ: G → Homeo(X) (with compact-open topology) is continuous.\n\nAlternatively, if the required conditions are only on X, like locally compact Hausdorff, then the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nProve that for a topological group G acting on X, the two definitions of a continuous action (as stated) are equivalent.\n\nBut to be precise, the equivalence requires that both directions hold. Since the user already knows that 1 ⇒ 2 always, the key is 2 ⇒ 1 under certain conditions. Therefore, the problem is to show that under the assumptions on X (locally compact Hausdorff), 2 implies 1, hence they are equivalent. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions on X and G (G being a topological group is part of the problem setup), and state the problem to prove equivalence.\n\nSo, after all this, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a topological group,\nX is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nProblem:\nProve that the two definitions of a continuous action of G on X are equivalent, where the first definition requires the action map G×X→X to be continuous, and the second requires each ρ_g to be a homeomorphism and the homomorphism G→Homeo(X) (with compact-open topology) to be continuous.",
