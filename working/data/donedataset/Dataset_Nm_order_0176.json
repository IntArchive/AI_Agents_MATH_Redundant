    "Content": "This conjecture is tested for all odd natural numbers less than $10^8$ : If $n>1$ is an odd natural number, then there are natural numbers $a,b$ such that $n=a+b$ and $a^2+b^2\\in\\mathbb P$ . $\\mathbb P$ is the set of prime numbers. I wish help with counterexamples, heuristics or a proof. Addendum: As in Greg Martins answer $$k(n)\\approx k'(n)=\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{n}{\\ln n}\n\\displaystyle \\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv1\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\mid n}} \\frac{p-1} {p-2}\\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv3\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\mid n}} \\frac {p-1}p$$ which gives the diagram where $k$ is the blue curve and $k'$ is the red curve.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are some heuristics. As Hans Engler defines, let $k(n)$ be the number of pairs $(a,b)$ with $a<b$ for which $a+b=n$ and $a^2+b^2$ is prime. In other words,\n$$\nk(n) = \\#\\{ 1\\le a < \\tfrac n2 \\colon a^2 + (n-a)^2 = 2a^2 - 2an + n^2 \\text{ is prime} \\}.\n$$\nIgnoring issues of uniformity in $n$, the Bateman–Horn conjecture predicts that the number of prime values of an irreducible polynomial $f(a)$ up to $x$ is asymptotic to\n$$\n\\frac x{\\log x} \\prod_p \\bigg( 1-\\frac1p \\bigg)^{-1} \\bigg( 1-\\frac{\\sigma(p)}p \\bigg),\n$$\nwhere $\\log$ denotes the natural logarithm and\n$$\n\\sigma(p) = \\#\\{ 1\\le t\\le p\\colon f(t) \\equiv 0 \\pmod p \\}.\n$$ We now calculate $\\sigma(p)$ for $f(a) = 2a^2 - 2an + n^2$.\nNote that the discriminant of $f$ is $(-2n)^2 - 4\\cdot2n^2 = -4n^2$. Therefore if $p$ does not divide $-4n^2$, the number of solutions is given by the Legendre symbol\n$$\n\\sigma(p) = 1 + \\bigg (\\frac{-4n^2}p\\bigg) = 1 + \\bigg (\\frac{-1}p\\bigg) = \\begin{cases}\n2, &\\text{if } p\\equiv1\\pmod 4, \\\\\n0, &\\text{if } p\\equiv3\\pmod 4.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFurthermore, we can check by hand that if $p=2$ then $\\sigma(p)=0$, while if $p$ divides $n$ then $\\sigma(p)=1$. Therefore our prediction becomes\n$$\nk(n) \\approx \\frac{n/2}{\\log(n/2)} \\cdot 2 \\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv1\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\nmid n}} \\frac{p-2}{p-1} \\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv3\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\nmid n}} \\frac p{p-1}.\n$$\n(We're abusing notation: those two products don't individually converge, but their product converges when the primes are taken in their natural order.)\nIn principle that constant could be cleverly evaluated to several decimal places. But for the purposes of experiment, perhaps it's valuable to note that $k(n)$ should be approximately $n/\\log n$, times some universal constant, times\n$$\n\\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv1\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\mid n}} \\frac{p-1} {p-2}\\prod_{\\substack{p\\equiv3\\pmod 4 \\\\ p\\mid n}} \\frac {p-1}p;\n$$\nand so the data can be normalized by that function of $n$ to test for consistency.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. First, I need to read through the original question on Math Stack Exchange and filter out the unrelated information. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then they stated the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem here is about a conjecture that any odd number greater than 1 can be expressed as the sum of two natural numbers a and b such that a² + b² is prime. The user mentions that it's tested up to 10^8 and is seeking help with counterexamples, heuristics, or a proof. There's also an addendum about an approximation function k(n) by Greg Martin, but I think that's additional context, not part of the core problem.\n\nSo, applying the format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. The problem states that n is an odd natural number greater than 1. The conjecture is that there exist natural numbers a and b such that their sum is n and the sum of their squares is prime. So each assumption here would be:\n\n- n is an odd natural number.\n- n > 1.\n- There exist natural numbers a, b such that a + b = n.\n- a² + b² is a prime number.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that for any odd n >1, such a and b exist. So the assumptions are the conditions given on n, and the problem is the statement to prove. So in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the original problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an odd natural number.\n- n > 1.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that there exist natural numbers a, b such that n = a + b and a² + b² is prime.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both the conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem states n is an odd natural number greater than 1, so those are the two assumptions. The existence of a and b is part of the problem statement to prove, not the assumption. So the user's original problem's assumptions are the conditions given for n.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an odd natural number,\nn > 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist natural numbers a, b such that n = a + b and a² + b² is a prime number.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. So \"n is an odd natural number\" and \"n > 1\" are separate lines. The problem part then states the conjecture to prove. The addendum about Greg Martin's approximation and the diagram with k(n) and k'(n) seems to be part of the context provided by the original question, but not part of the problem itself. Therefore, those should be filtered out as unrelated information.\n\nSo the final structured problem should list the two assumptions about n and then the problem statement. Let me check the example again. The example had the problem to prove something about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, similarly, the problem is to prove the existence of a and b given n is odd and greater than 1. Therefore, the formatted answer should be as above.",
