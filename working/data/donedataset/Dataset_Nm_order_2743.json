    "Content": "Possible Duplicate: Infinity = -1 paradox I was told by a friend that $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \\dots$ equaled negative one. When I asked for an explanation, he said: Do I have to? Okay so, Let $x = 1+2+4+8+\\dots$ $2x-x=x$ $2(1+2+4+8+\\dots) - (1+2+4+8+\\dots) = (1+2+4+8+\\dots)$ Therefore, $(2+4+8+16+\\dots) + (-1-2-4-8+\\dots) = (1+2+4+8+\\dots)$. Now $-2$ and $2$, $-4$ and $4$, $-8$ and $8$ and so on, cancel out, and the only thing left is $-1$. Therefore, $1+2+4+8+\\dots = -1$. I feel that this conclusion is not right, but I cannot express it. Can anyone tell if this proof is wrong, and if it is, how it is wrong?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first mistake is right at the beginning, in writing \"Let $x=1+2+4+\\cdots$.\"  This builds in the assumption that there is such an object as $1+2+4+\\cdots$. The second mistake lies in treating this supposed object as if it were a finite but maybe very long sum, to which  the sensible rules for manipulating finite sums apply. Remark: Think about the \"sum\" $1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots$. If we call this $x$, and use a manipulation analogous to the one that you made, we end up with the conclusion that the \"sum\" is $2$. When infinite series are formally defined, it turns out that the answer is indeed $2$. So some \"natural\" manipulations yield nonsense, and some yield correct results. Of course that is not a tolerable state of affairs: we cannot use manipulational techniques that sometimes yield a correct result, and sometimes don't. This sort of issue, at a more sophisticated level, led mathematicians  in the second half of the $19$th century to look for very careful definitions of the fundamental objects of mathematics, and rigorous proofs of their basic properties.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given example. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Prove 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + … = -1\". The user mentions a friend who claims this sum equals -1 and provides a proof. The user is skeptical and wants to know if the proof is wrong and why.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the sum of a series. The key assumptions here might relate to the conditions under which the series is evaluated. Let's see:\n\nThe friend's proof starts by letting x equal the infinite sum 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ..., then manipulates it by multiplying by 2 and subtracting. This leads to x = -1. The user questions this conclusion.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be about the nature of the series. The series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is a geometric series with ratio 2. Normally, such a series diverges in the realm of real numbers because the common ratio is greater than 1. However, in certain contexts like p-adic numbers or using analytic continuation, such sums can be assigned finite values. But the friend's proof doesn't mention any of this; they just use algebraic manipulation as if the series converges in the traditional sense.\n\nTherefore, the critical assumption here is treating the divergent series as if it converges in the conventional real number system. So each assumption line should address one property or condition. Let me list them:\n\n1. The infinite series S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is considered.\n2. The series S is treated as a convergent series in the real numbers.\n3. Algebraic manipulations valid for convergent series are applied to S.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to prove that 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... equals -1, but under the assumptions that the series is convergent and standard algebra applies. However, in reality, the series diverges, so the assumption is invalid. But the user's friend's approach assumes convergence, leading to the paradoxical result.\n\nWait, the example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each line is a separate condition. So here, the assumptions would be each step in the conditions under which the problem is posed. Let me re-express:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The series S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is considered.\n- The series S is assigned a finite value.\n- Algebraic operations valid for convergent series are applied to S (specifically, multiplying by 2 and subtracting).\n\nBut perhaps more precisely:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Let S be the sum of the infinite series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...\n- The series S converges to a finite real number.\n- The operation 2S - S = S is valid under standard algebraic manipulation for infinite series.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption addressing one property. The problem then is the original one: Prove that S = -1.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nS is the sum of the infinite series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...,\nS converges to a finite real number,\nStandard algebraic operations (multiplying by a constant and subtracting series term-by-term) are valid for S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the nature of the series and the operations allowed. So maybe the key is to capture the necessary conditions the friend's proof relies on. The friend assumes S is a number you can manipulate like a finite sum, so the main assumption is treating a divergent series as convergent.\n\nBut since each assumption must be a single line, applied to one object, let's structure it accordingly.\n\nAssumption:\nThe infinite series S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is assigned a finite value,\nThe series S follows the linearity of convergent series (i.e., scalar multiplication and term-wise subtraction are valid).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... exists in the real numbers,\nMultiplying S by 2 yields 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ...,\nSubtracting S from 2S term-wise cancels all terms except -1.\n\nBut the example from the user had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate condition. So here, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The infinite series S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is considered.\n2. The series S converges to a finite real number.\n3. Algebraic operations applicable to convergent series (like term-wise subtraction and scalar multiplication) can be applied to S.\n\nBut maybe breaking it down more:\n\nAssumption:\nLet S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...,\nS is a finite real number,\n2S = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ...,\nThe subtraction 2S - S is valid term-wise.\n\nBut perhaps each line should be a single condition applied to one object. For example:\n\n- S is defined as the sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...\n- The series S converges in the real numbers.\n- The operation 2S is equivalent to the series 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ...\n- Term-by-term subtraction of S from 2S is valid.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. The key assumptions are that S is a finite real number (i.e., converges) and that the algebraic manipulation used is valid for such a series. So maybe two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nS = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is a convergent series,\nStandard algebraic manipulations (multiplying by constants and subtracting series term-wise) are valid for S.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S = -1.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the critical assumption is that S is convergent, which is not true in standard analysis. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions that S is convergent and the algebraic steps are valid, leading to the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is convergent,\nAlgebraic operations on S (multiplying by 2 and subtracting) preserve equality.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S = -1.\n\nYes, that seems concise. Each assumption addresses one property: first, the convergence of the series, second, the validity of the algebraic operations. Then the problem is to prove the sum equals -1 under these assumptions.",
