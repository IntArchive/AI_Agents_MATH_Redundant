    "Content": "Prove that if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}z_{n}=A$ then:\n $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\frac{z_{1}+z_{2}+\\cdots + z_{n}}{n}=A$$\nI was thinking spliting it in: $$(z_{1}+z_{2}+\\cdots+z_{N-1})+(z_{N}+z_{N+1}+\\cdots+z_{n})$$\nwhere $N$ is value of $n$ for which $|A-z_{n}|<\\epsilon$\nthen taking the limit of this sum devided by $n$ , and noting that the second sum is as close as you wish to $nA$ while the first is as close as you wish to $0$. Not sure if this helps....",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It seems like Homework problem, hence I'll just give hint:\n$$\\frac{z_1+z_2+\\cdots +z_n}{n}-A=\\frac {(z_1-A)+(z_2-A)+\\cdots +(z_n-A)}{n}$$\nNow use the defn of limit that for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N_0 \\in \\mathbb N$ such that $|z_m-A| < \\epsilon \\ \\forall m \\geq N_0$ Also remember triangle inequality : $|a_1+a_2+\\cdots +a_n| \\leq |a_1| + |a_2| +\\cdots +|a_n|$ Can you find proper $a_i$ in terms of say $z_i$'s??",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that if the limit of z_n as n approaches infinity is A, then the Cesàro mean (the average of the first n terms) also converges to A. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that the limit of z_n is A. That's the main assumption. Each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property or condition of one object. So here, the sequence z_n has a limit A as n approaches infinity. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The problem mentions splitting the sum into two parts: up to N-1 and from N to n. The user mentions choosing N such that |A - z_n| < ε for n ≥ N. That's part of their approach, but it's not an assumption given in the problem statement. The original problem only states the convergence of z_n to A. So the key assumption is that the limit of z_n is A.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the only assumption is that the sequence z_n converges to A. There's no mention of divisibility or integers here. So I need to extract all explicit assumptions from the problem. The problem says \"if lim_{n→∞} z_n = A\", so that's the primary condition. Are there any other conditions? The problem is about the convergence of the Cesàro mean, which typically requires that the original sequence converges. So the only assumption is that z_n approaches A as n becomes large. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be that each term z_n approaches A. Since the problem is about the average of the first n terms, the Cesàro mean, the key assumption is the convergence of the sequence z_n to A. So in the assumption section, it's just one line: \"The sequence z_n converges to A as n approaches infinity.\"\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the limit of (z_1 + z_2 + ... + z_n)/n is A. So the problem statement is clear. I need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user's attempt splits the sum into two parts, but that's part of their approach, not an assumption. So the formatted problem should have the assumption that z_n converges to A, and the problem is to prove the convergence of the Cesàro mean to the same limit A.",
