    "Content": "Let $k$ be a field, then I want to prove the following statement: for every $P=(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\in K^n$, the ideal $\\mathfrak{m}_P=(x_1-b_1,\\ldots,x_n-b_n)$ is maximal in the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$. To prove this, I consider the evaluation map\n$$v_P:k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]\\longrightarrow k$$\nsending a polynomial $f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ to $f(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)$. Then $v_P$ is a surjective morphism of rings. So we have that the quotient of $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ by the kernel of $v_P$ is isomorphic to $k$, which is a field, thus is a field itself and $\\ker v_P$ is maximal. So we are left to prove that $\\mathfrak{m}_P=\\ker v_P$. One of the inclusions is obvious, by definition of $\\mathfrak{m}_P$. On the other side, I don't know how to prove that $\\ker v_P$ is contained in $\\mathfrak{m}_P$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\varphi:K[X_1,\\dots,X_n]\\to K[X_1,\\dots,X_n]$ defined by $\\varphi(X_i)=X_i+b_i$ for all $i$. Then $\\varphi$ is a $K$-automorphism of $K[X_1,\\dots,X_n]$ and $\\mathfrak m_P=(X_1-b_1,\\dots,X_n-b_n)$ is maximal iff $\\varphi(\\mathfrak m_P)$ is maximal. But $\\varphi(\\mathfrak m_P)=(X_1,\\dots,X_n)$. It remains to prove that $(X_1,\\dots,X_n)$ is maximal. Now use the evaluation homomorphism $K[X_1,\\dots,X_n]\\to K$ sending $X_i$ to $0$ for all $i$. Then its kernel coincide to $(X_1,\\dots,X_n)$. Why? Since $f(0,\\dots,0)=0$ iff $f\\in(X_1,\\dots,X_n)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, the user wants to show that the ideal 𝔪_P, generated by (x₁ - b₁, ..., xₙ - bₙ), is maximal in the polynomial ring k[x₁, ..., xₙ] where k is a field. They've considered the evaluation map v_P that sends a polynomial f to f(b₁, ..., bₙ). They've correctly noted that the kernel of this map is an ideal, and since the image is a field (k), the kernel must be maximal. Now, they need to prove that this kernel is exactly 𝔪_P. One inclusion is clear: 𝔪_P is contained in the kernel because evaluating any polynomial in 𝔪_P at P gives zero. The other direction, showing that the kernel is contained in 𝔪_P, is where they're stuck.\n\nHmm, so the key part here is showing that any polynomial f that vanishes at P (i.e., f(P) = 0) must be in the ideal generated by (x₁ - b₁, ..., xₙ - bₙ). I remember that in algebraic geometry, this relates to the idea that the ideal of functions vanishing at a point in affine space is exactly the maximal ideal generated by the linear polynomials (x_i - b_i). But how to prove this algebraically?\n\nMaybe using polynomial division or induction on the number of variables. Let's think about the single-variable case first. If n=1, then k[x] and a point P = b. Any polynomial f(x) with f(b) = 0 can be written as (x - b)g(x), so f is in (x - b), which is the kernel. So that works. For multiple variables, perhaps we can use the fact that if a polynomial vanishes at P, then we can express it as a combination of (x_i - b_i) terms.\n\nOne approach is to perform a substitution: let y_i = x_i - b_i, so translating the point P to the origin. Then the problem reduces to showing that any polynomial f(y₁, ..., yₙ) that vanishes at the origin (all y_i = 0) is in the ideal (y₁, ..., yₙ). That seems more straightforward. In this translated system, such a polynomial f has no constant term because f(0) = 0. Then, each term of f has at least one y_i factor, so f can be written as a sum of terms each divisible by some y_i. Hence, f is in the ideal generated by y₁, ..., yₙ. Therefore, in the original variables, this would mean f is in 𝔪_P.\n\nBut wait, does that hold in multiple variables? Let's check. Suppose f is a polynomial in y₁, ..., yₙ with no constant term. Then, can we write f as a linear combination of y_i's with coefficients in the polynomial ring? For example, take f = y₁y₂. This is already in the ideal since it's y₁ times y₂. Similarly, higher-degree terms can be expressed as products of the generators. Wait, but the ideal is generated by linear terms, so any polynomial without a constant term is in the ideal? That seems to be the case because you can factor out at least one y_i from each monomial. For instance, take a monomial y₁^a y₂^b ... yₙ^c where a + b + ... + c ≥ 1. Then, since at least one exponent is positive, say a ≥ 1, we can write this as y₁ * (y₁^{a-1} y₂^b ... yₙ^c), which is in the ideal. Therefore, every term in f can be expressed as a multiple of some y_i, so the entire polynomial f is in the ideal. Therefore, the kernel is exactly 𝔪_P.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key idea is that after translating the point to the origin, polynomials vanishing there have no constant term and thus are in the ideal generated by the variables, which correspond to (x_i - b_i) in the original coordinates. Therefore, ker v_P is contained in 𝔪_P, hence they are equal.",
