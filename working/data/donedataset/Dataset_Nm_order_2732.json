    "Content": "Problem: Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions such that $f: X \\to Y\n $ and $g : X \\to Y $ , and $Y$ is a Hausdorff space. Suppose $f(x) = g(x)\n $ for all $x \\in A \\subseteq X $ where $A$ is dense in $X$ , then $f(x)\n = g(x) $ for all $x \\in  X $ . Attempt at a solution: Put $h(x) = f - g $ . Therefore, $h: X \\to Y $ is continuous and $Y$ is Hausdorff by hypothesis. Also we know $h(x) = 0 $ for all $x \\in A $ such that $A$ is dense in $X$ . I want to show that $h(x)$ vanishes everywhere in $X$ . We can show $h(x) = 0 $ for all $x \\in X \\setminus A $ . Suppose $h(x) > 0 $ on $X \\setminus A$ . Pick points $y_1,y_2 \\in Y $ . Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, can find open set $O_1, O_2 \\subseteq Y $ which are disjoint such that $y_1 \\in O_1$ and $y_2 \\in O_2$ . By continuity, $f^{-1}(O_1), f^{-1}(O_2)$ are open in $X$ . I know that if I can show that one of the $f^{-1}(O_i)$ lies in $X \\setminus A $ , then we would have a contradiction since we have non-empty open set in $X \\setminus A$ and this implies $A$ cannot be dense in $X$ . But this is the part I am stuck. Any help would greatly be appreciated. Also, Would be be possible to prove this without using the Hausdorff condition on $Y$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $f(x_0) \\neq g(x_0)$, then since $Y$ is Hausdorff, there are open sets $U,V \\subset Y$ such that\n$$\nf(x_0) \\in U, g(x_0) \\in V, \\text{ and } U\\cap V = \\emptyset\n$$\nNow\n$$\nx_0\\in f^{-1}(U)\\cap g^{-1}(V) =: W\n$$\nand $W$ is open, and hence $\\exists a\\in A\\cap W$, whence\n$$\nf(a) = g(a) \\in U\\cap V \\Rightarrow U\\cap V \\neq \\emptyset\n$$\nThis contradiction proves the result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title of the question is: \"$f,g$ continuous from $X$ to $Y$. if they are agree on a dense set $A$ of $X$ then they agree on $X$\". The problem statement in the question body is similar but adds that $Y$ is a Hausdorff space. The user's attempt uses the Hausdorff property to separate points with disjoint open sets, and they're trying to reach a contradiction regarding the density of $A$. They also ask if the Hausdorff condition is necessary.\n\nNow, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The key is to extract all assumptions, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n1. $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions from $X$ to $Y$.\n2. $Y$ is a Hausdorff space.\n3. $A$ is a dense subset of $X$.\n4. $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in A$.\n\nThe problem is to prove that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, that wasn't mentioned. So maybe the example had an extra assumption. Here, the original problem states that $Y$ is Hausdorff, $A$ is dense, and $f,g$ agree on $A$. So those are the assumptions. Each should be a separate line, each about one object.\n\nI need to list each assumption separately. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n- \"Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions such that $f: X \\to Y$ and $g : X \\to Y$, and $Y$ is a Hausdorff space.\" So three things here: $f$ continuous, $g$ continuous, $Y$ is Hausdorff.\n\nWait, the problem says \"continuous functions\", so both $f$ and $g$ are continuous. That's two separate assumptions: one for $f$, one for $g$. But maybe the problem groups them as one? The example grouped \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate. So perhaps here, \"f is continuous\", \"g is continuous\", \"Y is Hausdorff\", \"A is dense in X\", and \"f(x)=g(x) for all x in A\".\n\nYes, each of these is a separate condition. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: X \\to Y$ is continuous,\n$g: X \\to Y$ is continuous,\n$Y$ is a Hausdorff space,\n$A$ is a dense subset of $X$,\n$f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in A$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nWait, the original problem's problem statement is exactly that. So that's correct. But in the example, they didn't list the continuity as separate assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem here, all assumptions are given in the problem, so perhaps the example was a modified problem. But in our case, we need to list all assumptions given in the problem, each as a separate line.\n\nThe original problem states:\n\n\"Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions such that $f: X \\to Y$ and $g : X \\to Y $, and $Y$ is a Hausdorff space. Suppose $f(x) = g(x) $ for all $x \\in A \\subseteq X $ where $A$ is dense in $X$ , then $f(x) = g(x) $ for all $x \\in X $.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is continuous (since they are \"two continuous functions\")\n2. g is continuous\n3. Y is Hausdorff\n4. A is dense in X\n5. f and g agree on A\n\nTherefore, each of these should be separate assumptions. So the formatted problem would have those five assumptions listed line by line, and the problem is to prove f(x) = g(x) for all x in X.\n\nI need to check if I missed any conditions. For example, the problem mentions X and Y as topological spaces implicitly. But since the user is structuring the problem as per given, maybe we don't need to state that X is a topological space unless specified. But in the problem, it's about continuity and dense subsets, so X and Y are topological spaces by default. However, since the problem doesn't explicitly state that, maybe the user doesn't need to list that as an assumption. The assumptions given explicitly are the continuity of f and g, Y being Hausdorff, A being dense, and agreement on A.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those five points as separate assumptions. Let me write that out.",
