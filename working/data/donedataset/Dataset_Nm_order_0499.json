    "Content": "Consider the following polynomial: $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\text{prime}(k)x^{k-1}$$ where $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\text{prime}(n)$ is the $n$ th prime. The first few polynomials are: \\begin{align}\nn=1&:\\quad 2\\\\\nn=2&:\\quad 2+3x\\\\\nn=3&:\\quad 2+3x+5x^2\\\\\nn=4&:\\quad 2+3x+5x^2+7x^3\n\\end{align} Consider the number of real roots of these polynomials. The first few number of real roots of these polynomials form the sequence $0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,...$ . This alternating zeros and $1$ 's pattern holds for all primes less than $1000$ (verified by @Quimey) I have two questions: Does this pattern always hold? Said in another way, is the number of real roots of the polynomial $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\text{prime}(k)x^{k-1}$ always equal to $(1 + (-1)^{n})/2$ ? Is yes, how can we prove it?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The pattern breaks down at $n = 2437$ , where the polynomial has two real roots according to the following code in SageMath (which outputs 2 ). R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)\nprimes = primes_first_n(2437)\np = sum(np.array(primes)*np.array([x**i for i in range(len(primes))]))\nprint(pari(p).polsturm()) I think this is the smallest such $n$ . I'm not sure why the sequence breaks there in particular; the prime gaps around $\\text{prime}(2437)=21727$ don't look particularly special. We can exclude an error in the software by checking the exact value of the polynomial at rational points near the two roots (thanks to Ivan Neretin for the suggestion). I used SymPy's Rational class, but this could also be done using Python's int type and multiplying by the largest denominator power in the polynomial to avoid fractions. The output of the code import sympy\nn = 2437\nsympy.sieve.extend_to_no(n)\nfor numerator in [-9967, -9966, -9965]:\n    x = sympy.Rational(numerator, 10000)\n    print(sympy.functions.sign(sum([sympy.sieve[i+1]*x**i for i in range(n)]))) is 1, -1, 1 , which proves that the polynomial has at least two real roots (by continuity).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break down this problem. So the user is talking about these polynomials where each coefficient is a prime number. The polynomial for n is sum_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k-1}. For example, when n=1, it's just 2, which has no real roots. For n=2, it's 2 + 3x, which has one real root. Then n=3 is 2 + 3x +5x², which they say has 0 real roots, and this alternates between 0 and 1 for the number of real roots as n increases. They claim this pattern holds up to primes less than 1000.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether this pattern always holds, meaning the number of real roots is (1 + (-1)^n)/2. That formula gives 0 when n is odd and 1 when n is even. So for even n, the polynomial should have 1 real root, and for odd n, 0 real roots.\n\nBut wait, how does that work? For n=1, it's a constant polynomial 2, which has no roots. n=2 is linear, so one root. n=3 is quadratic, but they say it has 0 real roots. Wait, a quadratic should have two roots, but maybe in this case, the discriminant is negative. Let me check. For n=3: 2 + 3x +5x². The quadratic equation would be 5x² +3x +2 =0. Discriminant is 9 - 40 = -31, which is negative, so indeed no real roots. Then n=4 would be a cubic: 2 +3x +5x² +7x³. Cubics must have at least one real root. But the user says the number of real roots alternates 0,1,0,1,... So for even n, 1 real root, odd n, 0? Wait, but for n=4, which is even, the polynomial is degree 3 (since k goes up to 4, so x^3 term). Wait, hold on: the polynomial for n is sum_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k-1}. So for n=1, it's degree 0 (x^{0}), n=2 is degree 1, n=3 is degree 2, n=4 is degree 3. So the degree of the polynomial is n-1. Therefore, for n even, the polynomial is of odd degree (n-1 is odd when n is even), which must have at least one real root. For n odd, the polynomial is of even degree (n-1 is even), so it can have zero real roots. \n\nBut the user is observing that for even n, there's exactly one real root, and for odd n, none. That's interesting. So the pattern is that when the degree is even (n odd), there are no real roots, and when the degree is odd (n even), there's exactly one real root. The question is whether this holds for all n, given that the coefficients are primes.\n\nSo the problem is to prove that the number of real roots of the polynomial P_n(x) = prime(1) + prime(2)x + prime(3)x² + ... + prime(n)x^{n-1} is equal to (1 + (-1)^n)/2. That is, 0 if n is odd, 1 if n is even.\n\nThe user also mentions that this has been verified up to primes less than 1000, so n up to 1000 maybe?\n\nSo assumptions here: The coefficients are prime numbers, with prime(k) being the k-th prime. The polynomial is of degree n-1. The user is asking if the number of real roots alternates between 0 and 1 depending on the parity of n. So when n is even (degree odd), there's one real root, and when n is odd (degree even), no real roots.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check the original problem again. The user wrote: \"the number of real roots of the polynomial sum_{k=1}^n prime(k)x^{k-1} always equal to (1 + (-1)^n)/2\". Let me compute (1 + (-1)^n)/2. If n is even: (1 +1)/2=1. If n is odd: (1 -1)/2=0. So indeed, the number of real roots is 1 if n even, 0 if n odd.\n\nBut in the example given, n=1: 0 roots (n odd), n=2:1 root (n even), n=3:0 roots (n odd), n=4:1 root (n even). So the pattern holds. The problem is to prove this for all n, given that coefficients are primes.\n\nNow, possible assumptions. The problem statement includes that the coefficients are primes. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of prime(k) x^{k-1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut wait, the user didn't specify that n is a natural number, but they do mention n ∈ N. So maybe that's an assumption. Also, the coefficients are primes. The structure here is that each coefficient is a prime, and they are in order (2,3,5,7,...). \n\nSo when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list each condition. Let me see the example given in the original format. The example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in that problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the example, the formatted problem changed the assumption to n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that was a different problem. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake? Let me check. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original problem was different. The example seems to be that the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem's assumption added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but if the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7, that's a different problem. Maybe the example was a mistake. However, the user is asking me to follow the format where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about polynomials with coefficients being the primes, and the number of real roots alternates. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial is defined as P_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k-1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime number.\n\n- n is a natural number (since n ∈ N is given).\n\nBut the problem is about the number of real roots. The user also mentions that the pattern holds for all primes less than 1000. Wait, but the coefficients are primes, but the primes being less than 1000 is part of the verification. So maybe the assumption is that the coefficients are primes, but the user is asking if regardless of how large n gets (i.e., primes can be larger than 1000), does the pattern still hold.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- For each natural number n, the polynomial P_n(x) is constructed with coefficients as the first n prime numbers.\n\n- The polynomial is of degree n-1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- For each natural number n, define the polynomial P_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k-1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime.\n\n- The number of real roots of P_n(x) is claimed to be (1 + (-1)^n)/2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking whether this pattern always holds. So the assumptions are inherent in the problem setup. The problem is to prove that for each natural number n, the number of real roots of the polynomial P_n(x) as defined is (1 + (-1)^n)/2. Therefore, the assumptions to list would be the conditions given in the problem:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- The polynomial P_n(x) is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of prime(k) x^{k-1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nprime(k) is the k-th prime number,\n\nP_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k-1}.\n\nBut wait, each line should address one object. Maybe:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- For each k from 1 to n, the coefficient of x^{k-1} in P_n(x) is the k-th prime number.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- P_n(x) is a polynomial of degree n−1.\n\nBut the problem is already structured as P_n(x) being that sum, so maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The polynomial P_n(x) is defined as ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime number.\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut maybe the user wants each assumption on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nprime(k) is the k-th prime number for k = 1, 2, ..., n,\n\nP_n(x) is the polynomial ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nFor each integer k where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, prime(k) is the k-th prime number,\n\nThe polynomial P_n(x) is defined as ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}.\n\nBut perhaps even more broken down. Since each line is one condition. For example:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nprime(k) is the k-th prime number for each integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n,\n\nP_n(x) is a polynomial in x with terms from k=1 to n,\n\nThe coefficient of x^{k−1} in P_n(x) is prime(k).\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. The original example had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each line is a separate condition. So for this problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are the first n prime numbers,\n\nThe polynomial is of degree n−1.\n\nBut each of these is a separate condition. So:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- The polynomial P_n(x) has coefficients equal to the first n prime numbers.\n\n- The polynomial P_n(x) is of degree n−1.\n\nBut in reality, the degree is determined by the highest exponent, which is n−1 since the terms are x^{k−1} up to k=n. So maybe:\n\n- The polynomial P_n(x) is defined as ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}, where prime(k) is the k-th prime number.\n\nBut that's a single assumption. Wait, the example had multiple assumptions even though the original problem was a single statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem had:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, changing the problem. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, the user wants me to follow the format where assumptions are listed line by line, each being one condition.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nprime(k) is the k-th prime number for each integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n,\n\nThe polynomial P_n(x) is defined as ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}.\n\nProblem: Is the number of real roots of P_n(x) equal to (1 + (-1)^n)/2?\n\nBut the user also asks to \"structure that problem as the following format\", so following the example, the problem line would restate the problem. The user's original question is: \"Does this pattern always hold? Said in another way, is the number of real roots of the polynomial ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k)x^{k−1} always equal to (1 + (-1)^n)/2? If yes, how can we prove it?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that the number of real roots is (1 + (-1)^n)/2.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nFor each integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n, prime(k) is the k-th prime number,\n\nThe polynomial P_n(x) is defined as ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of real roots of P_n(x) is equal to (1 + (-1)^n)/2.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is one line, one condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nFor each k in {1, 2, ..., n}, prime(k) denotes the k-th prime number,\n\nP_n(x) is the polynomial ∑_{k=1}^n prime(k) x^{k−1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that the number of real roots of P_n(x) is (1 + (-1)^n)/2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The first line states n is natural. The second defines prime(k). The third defines the polynomial. Then the problem is to prove the number of real roots is that expression.\n\nI think that's the correct structure.",
