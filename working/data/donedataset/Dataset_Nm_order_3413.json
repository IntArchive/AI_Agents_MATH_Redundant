    "Content": "I'm reading the Wikipedia proof for the MVT, and it uses Rolle's theorem. In fact, many other websites that prove MVT do the same. When I first read the statement of the mean value theorem, I thought it must obviously be true because the alternative, that $f'(x) > \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\ \\forall x \\in (a,b)$ was absurd (and same for $f'(x)$ strictly less than the right hand side), because the rate of increase of the function being higher than the average rate of increase at all points contradicts the very definition of the average rate of increase. By this, I mean that if the function $f$ was increasing at the average rate $f'(x) = \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\ \\forall x \\in (a,b)$ then it would exactly go straight from $(a, f(a))$ to $(b, f(b))$ (this is the definition of average), and so if it's always increasing strictly faster , then surely it increases \"too much\" to be able to get down to $(b, f(b))$ in time, so to speak. Yet, I do not see sites formalizing this to give a proof by contradiction of the mean value theorem in a line or two, so I imagine this must be going wrong somewhere. Could someone tell me where?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $f'$ is continuous then you can use your argument and the intermediate value theorem to prove MVT. As a first, somewhat minor criticism of this approach, MVT doesn't assume that $f'$ is continuous. Consequently, to prove the \"full\" MVT in this fashion, you have to show that a derivative, even if it isn't continuous, has the intermediate value property. This is true, actually; the result is called Darboux's theorem. Of course, you could prove a weaker MVT that relies on $f'$ being continuous without Darboux's theorem, and from here you could do a lot of practical analysis. More importantly though, there is some setup required to even invoke the intermediate value property, and this setup is a little bit more difficult to formally prove than you seem to think it is. Specifically, you need to prove that for $m=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ , if there is no point where $f'=m$ then there must be a point where $f'<m$ and another point where $f'>m$ . From the point of view of someone who has prior exposure to calculus, the obvious way to do that is to assume one inequality or the other, integrate both sides, and get a contradiction. But in order to do that, you need the fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC). The issue is that generally one develops the theory in the other direction, with MVT preceding FTC, and even being used to prove FTC. I won't claim it's impossible to work in the other order, but there is definitely more involved in proving FTC than there is in proving Rolle's theorem. Now as was pointed out in the comments, there is a different way to go. That is to immediately look at $g(x)=f(x)-m(x-a)$ and derive a contradiction from the assumption that $g'$ has a definite sign. From there you can use the intermediate value theorem to prove \"weak MVT\", while Darboux's theorem gets you \"full MVT\". But this route is basically the same idea as proving and then applying Rolle's theorem. You're just skipping directly to the more general scenario of MVT rather than identifying Rolle's theorem as a special case along the way. I would argue that this way of developing the theory is worse because the picture for MVT is not as easy to see as the picture for Rolle's theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking why there isn't a simple proof by contradiction for the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) based on the intuition that if the derivative were always greater than the average rate of change, the function would overshoot the endpoint. They mention that this seems contradictory, but existing proofs use Rolle's theorem instead. The task is to identify why their proposed proof approach might fail.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the MVT statement: If a function f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) where f'(c) equals (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a). The user's idea is to assume the opposite—that f'(x) is always strictly greater (or less) than the average rate—and show this leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet me consider the user's proposed contradiction. Suppose f'(x) > (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a) for all x in (a, b). If we integrate the derivative from a to b, we get f(b) - f(a). But if the derivative is always greater than the average, then integrating should give a result greater than (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a) * (b - a) = f(b) - f(a). That's a contradiction because the integral of f' over [a, b] is exactly f(b) - f(a). Wait, but this actually works as a proof! So why do standard proofs use Rolle's theorem instead?\n\nWait, but integration isn't typically used in the proof of MVT because the MVT is often proved before the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. So maybe the user is thinking in terms of calculus concepts that come after MVT, which would make their approach circular. Rolle's theorem is proved using the extreme value theorem and Fermat's theorem, which rely on continuity and differentiability, not integration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's intuition is correct but lacks rigor. For example, how do we know that the integral of a derivative greater than the average would exceed the total change? That's essentially the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but if we haven't covered that yet, we can't use it. So the problem might be that the contradiction relies on concepts not yet established when MVT is taught.\n\nAnother angle: The user assumes that if the derivative is always above the average, the function must end up higher than f(b). Let's formalize that. Suppose f'(x) > (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a) for all x in (a, b). Then, integrating from a to b, ∫ₐᵇ f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a). But if f'(x) > average, then ∫ₐᵇ f'(x) dx > ∫ₐᵇ average dx = average*(b - a) = f(b) - f(a). Therefore, f(b) - f(a) > f(b) - f(a), which is a contradiction. So this does work, but only if we can justify the integration step, which requires that f' is integrable (which it is, as f is differentiable, hence continuous, hence f' is not necessarily continuous but might be integrable via Darboux's theorem? Wait, Darboux's theorem says derivatives have the intermediate value property, but integrability is another matter. However, Riemann integrability requires the function to be continuous almost everywhere, but derivatives can be discontinuous on a meager set. Still, maybe the proof using integration is valid but not preferred because it's more advanced than Rolle's theorem approach.\n\nSo the answer might be that while the user's intuition can lead to a proof via contradiction using integration, the standard approach via Rolle's theorem is more elementary and doesn't require integration or the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Additionally, the contradiction approach might rely on properties (like integrability of derivatives) that are more advanced or not covered yet in the typical curriculum when MVT is introduced. Therefore, the user's idea isn't wrong per se, but it's not the standard proof because it uses tools beyond what's necessary at that point in the course.",
