    "Content": "I have this old qual problem that I don't know how to do: So let $ F: Rings \\to Sets$ given by $R \\mapsto \\{(a,b) \\in R^2, aR + bR =  R\\}$ . The action on the morphism is the obvious one. Now the problem asks to show that the functor is not representable. So here is what I found on the internet: According to the method on the second page of this pdf http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zbnorwood/ucla/files/repfunctors.pdf ,\nsuppose $F  = Hom(A, \\_)$ , then there is $(a, b) \\in A^2, aA + bA =A$ such that for $B$ a ring and $(x, y) \\in B^2, xB+ yB = B$ then there exists unique ring map $f: A \\to B$ such that $f(a) = x, f(b) = y$ . I don't know how to reach a contradiction from there. Or does anyone have any great method for proving a not representable functor is not representable in general? I find this type of problems really hard.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Some Motivation Recall that a (covariant) functor $F \\colon \\mathscr{C} \\to \\mathsf{Set}$ is representable by an object $A$ of $\\mathscr{C}$ if and only if there exists a universal element $a \\in F(A)$ .\nThis means that there exists for every other object $X$ of $\\mathscr{C}$ and every element $x \\in F(X)$ a unique morphism $f \\colon A \\to X$ in $\\mathscr{C}$ with $F(f)(a) = x$ .\nThe natural bijection $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathscr{C}}(A, -) \\to F$ is then given by $f \\mapsto F(f)(a)$ . A useful example to keep in mind in the functor $F \\colon \\mathsf{Ring} \\to \\mathsf{Set}$ given by $F(R) = R^n$ .\nThis functor is represented by the ring $A = \\mathbb{Z}\\langle t_1, \\dotsc, t_n \\rangle$ , the (non-commutative) polynomial ring in the  variables $t_1, \\dotsc, t_n$ .\nThe (usual) universal element $a \\in F(A)$ is given by $a = (t_1, \\dotsc, t_n)$ .\nAnd indeed, that this is a universal element means precisely that there exists for every other ring $R$ and every element $x \\in F(R)$ with $x = (x_1, \\dotsc, x_n)$ a unique ring homomorphism $f \\colon A \\to R$ with $F(f)(a) = x$ , i.e. with $f(t_i) = x_i$ for every $i = 1, \\dotsc, n$ .\nAnd this is precisely how the ring $A$ represents the functor $F$ . The Problem We show more generally that for every number of elements $n \\geq 2$ the functor \\begin{align*}\n  F\n  \\colon\n  \\mathsf{Ring}\n  &\\to\n  \\mathsf{Set},\n\\\\\n  R\n  &\\mapsto\n  \\{\n    (x_1, \\dotsc, x_n) \\in R^n\n  \\mid\n    x_1 R + \\dotsb + x_n R = R\n  \\}\n\\end{align*} is not representable.\nAssume otherwise that the functor $F$ is representable by a ring $A$ and let $(a_1, \\dotsc, a_n) \\in F(A)$ be the universal element (corresponding to some choice of isomorphism $F \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathsf{Ring}}(A,-)$ ). We will consider some auxilary functors which are representable:\nWe can consider for every index $i = 1, \\dotsc, n$ the functor \\begin{align*}\n  E_i\n  \\colon\n  \\mathsf{Ring}\n  &\\to\n  \\mathsf{Set},\n\\\\\n  R\n  &\\mapsto\n  \\{\n    (x_1, \\dotsc, x_n) \\in R^n\n  \\mid\n    \\text{$x_i$ is a unit in $R$}\n  \\} \\,.\n\\end{align*} This functor is representable by the ring $U_i := \\mathbb{Z}\\langle t_1, \\dotsc, t_n, t_i^{-1} \\rangle$ .\nWe can also consider for any two indices $i$ , $j$ with $1 \\leq i \\neq j \\leq n$ the functor \\begin{align*}\n  E_i\n  \\colon\n  \\mathsf{Ring}\n  &\\to\n  \\mathsf{Set},\n\\\\\n  R\n  &\\mapsto\n  \\{\n    (x_1, \\dotsc, x_n) \\in R^n\n  \\mid\n    \\text{$x_i$ and $x_j$ are units in $R$}\n  \\} \\,.\n\\end{align*} This functor is representable by the ring $U_{ij} := \\mathbb{Z}\\langle t_1, \\dotsc, t_n, t_i^{-1}, t_j^{-1} \\rangle$ .\nWe fix for the rest of this argumentation two such indices $i$ , $j$ .\n(This is where we use that $n \\geq 2$ .) We have inclusions of functors as follows: These inclusions correspond to ring homomorphism between their representing objects: The inclusion $E_i \\subseteq E_{ij}$ correspond to the canonical ring homomorphisms $U_i \\to U_{ij}$ , and the inclusion $E_i \\subseteq F$ correspond to the ring homomorphisms $f_i \\colon A \\to U_i$ with $f(a_k) = t_k$ for every index $k = 1, \\dotsc, n$ .\n(Such a homomorphism exists because it is the unique homorphism $f \\colon A \\to U_i$ with $F(f)( (a_1, \\dotsc, a_n) ) = (t_1, \\dotsc, t_n)$ .\nSo here we use that $(a_1, \\dotsc, a_n)$ is a universal element and that $(t_1, \\dotsc, t_n)$ is an element of $F(U_i)$ .)\nSimilar for $U_j$ instead of $U_i$ . The commutativity of the above diagram gives (by the faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding) the commutativity of the corresponding diagram: This means that $f_i(a) = f_j(a)$ for every element $a \\in A$ .\nIt follows that $f_i$ and $f_j$ restrict to the same ring homomorphism $f \\colon A \\to U_i \\cap U_j$ , with the intersection $U_i \\cap U_j$ taken in $U_{ij}$ .\nThis intersection is precisely the usual polynomial ring $U := \\mathbb{Z}\\langle t_1, \\dotsc, t_n \\rangle$ .\nWe have seen in the above explicit description of the homomorphism $f_i$ (and $f_j$ ) that the homomorphism $f \\colon A \\to U$ is given by $f(a_k) = t_k$ for every index $k = 1, \\dotsc, n$ .\nThe existence of such a homorphism means that $(t_1, \\dotsc, t_n) \\in F(U)$ bescause the ring $A$ represents the functor $F$ via the universal element $(a_1, \\dotsc, a_n) \\in F(A)$ .\nBut this would means that $U = t_1 U + \\dotsb + t_n U$ , which is not the case. We hence see that such a representing object $A$ cannot exist.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem about showing a functor is not representable. Let me start by understanding the original question and the example provided.\n\nThe user mentioned a functor F: Rings → Sets defined by R ↦ {(a,b) ∈ R² | aR + bR = R}. The task is to show this functor is not representable. The example given in the PDF suggests assuming representability (F ≅ Hom(A, -)) and then deriving a contradiction by looking at the universal element (a,b) in A² such that for any ring B and (x,y) in B² with xB + yB = B, there's a unique ring homomorphism f: A → B with f(a)=x and f(b)=y.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement according to the required format. Let me parse the original problem:\n\n- The functor F is defined from the category of Rings to Sets.\n- For each ring R, F(R) is the set of pairs (a,b) in R² such that the ideal generated by a and b is the entire ring R (aR + bR = R).\n- The action on morphisms is the obvious one, which would be: given a ring homomorphism φ: R → S, F(φ) sends (a,b) to (φ(a), φ(b)).\n- The problem is to show F is not representable.\n\nIn the example, the user structured the problem by listing assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then stating the problem. Here, the assumptions would relate to the properties of the functor F and the conditions required for representability.\n\nSo, for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. F is a functor from the category of Rings to the category of Sets.\n2. For each ring R, F(R) is the set {(a, b) ∈ R² | aR + bR = R}.\n3. The action of F on morphisms is given by composing with ring homomorphisms.\n4. If F were representable, there exists a ring A such that F is naturally isomorphic to Hom(A, -).\n5. Representability implies the existence of a universal element (a, b) in F(A) inducing bijections Hom(A, B) ≅ F(B) for all rings B.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions are specific conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem doesn't state any additional conditions beyond the definition of F. The key assumption is that F is defined as stated, and we need to use the properties of representable functors to derive a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the problem is to show F is not representable. The key assumption is the definition of F. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The functor F maps each ring R to the set of pairs (a, b) in R² such that the ideal aR + bR equals R.\n- F acts on morphisms by sending a ring homomorphism φ: R → S to the function F(φ): F(R) → F(S) defined by (a, b) ↦ (φ(a), φ(b)).\n\nProblem:\n- Show that F is not representable.\n\nBut the example's assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The user here is supposed to list the problem's assumptions line by line. Since the problem defines F and asks about representability, the assumptions are the definition of F. So each line should capture a single property.\n\nSo step by step:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. F: Rings → Sets is a functor.\n2. For each ring R, F(R) = {(a, b) ∈ R² | aR + bR = R}.\n3. For each ring homomorphism φ: R → S, F(φ) sends (a, b) ∈ F(R) to (φ(a), φ(b)) ∈ F(S).\n4. The problem is to show F is not representable.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both the definition of A(n) and the condition that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't have such conditions; it's about the functor's structure. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The functor F is defined by F(R) = {(a, b) ∈ R² | aR + bR = R} for every ring R.\n- The functor F maps a ring homomorphism φ: R → S to the function F(φ): F(R) → F(S) defined by (a, b) ↦ (φ(a), φ(b)).\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that the functor F is not representable.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- F is a functor from the category of Rings to the category of Sets.\n- For each ring R, F(R) is the set of pairs (a, b) in R² such that aR + bR = R.\n- For each ring homomorphism φ: R → S, F(φ) maps (a, b) ∈ F(R) to (φ(a), φ(b)) ∈ F(S).\n\nProblem:\n- Show that F is not representable.\n\nThat should be the structured problem. The key is to list each defining aspect of F as separate assumptions. The problem is straightforward as stated. The original problem also references methods from the PDF, but those are part of the user's attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself is just to show F is not representable given its definition.",
