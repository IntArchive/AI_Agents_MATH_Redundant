    "Content": "We were trying to solve this wonderful problem, but have not succeeded to solve. It goes like this:\nLet $R=[0,1]^2$, and $D\\subseteq R$ be a convex set which intersects each side of $R$. Define a plank to be a set of the kind $[a,b]\\times[0,1]$ or $[0,1]\\times[a,b]$. The planks are parallel to the axes. Show that for each set of planks that covers $D$, it holds that the sum of the areas of the planks is at least 1. Thanks,\nLLAP. A hint from the oracle: The Marriage theorem. (We still have yet to solve)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As promised, here is a geometric solution, without \"Marriage Theorem\" (I also would like to see a solution which uses it). A remark concerning probabilistic methods. : I do not think that the Lebesgue measure on $R$ is the right object here, since $D$ can have Lebesgue measure zero (if $D$ equals a diagonal of $R$). I do suspect however that there is a proof using a non-Lebesgue measure on $R$ which detects \"widths\" of subsets rather than their areas (see my comment on George Lowther's proof). However, I do not know how to construct one (at least, without first proving Theorem 1). Below is my solution almost completely rewritten (I originally missed two cases). I will label the vertices of $R$ as $a=(0,0), b=(0,1), c=(1,1), d=(1,0)$.  By the \"width\" of a plank I mean the length of its shorter side. I let $\\pi_1, \\pi_2$ denote the projections of $R$ to its horizontal side $ad$ and vertical side $ab$ respectively. Theorem 1. For every finite collection $C$  of planks covering $R$, the total width $W$ of $C$ is $\\ge 1$. Proof. The proof is by induction on the total number $N$ of planks. If $N=1$, it is clear that $W\\ge 1$. Now, consider the case $N=2$, when $C$ consist of one vertical plank $P$ and one horizontal plank $Q$ of the widths $v$ and $w$ respectively. (The case $N=2$ with just two horizontal or two vertical planks reduces immediately to $N=1$.) Lemma 1. If $N=2$ then $W=v+w\\ge 1$. Proof. Since $D$ intersects all four sides of $R$, consider the quadrilateral $D'=x_1y_1x_2 y_2\\subset D$ where $x_1\\in ad\\cap D, x_2\\in bc\\cap D', y_1\\in ab\\cap D', y_2\\in cd \\cap D$. The planks $P$ and $Q$ break edges of $R$ in subsegments of the lengths $g_1, g_2$ and  $h_1, h_2$, see figure below.  I will consider only the critical case depicted in the figure, where the segments $y_1x_2, x_2y_2, y_2x_1, x_1y_1$ pass through the four intersection points $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4$ of the boundaries of planks (if this is not the case, one can modify $D'$, $P$ and $Q$ so that the total width of $P$ and $Q$ strictly decreases and they still cover $D'$). Consider the shaded rectanges as in the figure: Rectangles marked with the same color have the same area. The total area of the four shaded rectanges adjacent to the corners of $R$ equals \n$$\n(h_1+h_2)(g_1+g_2)= (1-v)(1-w). \n$$\nOn the other hand, the area of the rectange $z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4$ equals $vw$ and, clearly, the total area of the shaded rectangles inside  $z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4$ equal $(1-v)(1-w)$. From this, we get\n$$\n(1-v)(1-w)\\le vw\n$$\n$$\n1\\le v+w=W,\n$$\nas claimed. qed. Now, let $N\\ge 3$ and assume that for each collection of $<N$ planks, $W\\ge 1$. I will now consider only collections of planks where each plank is different from the entire $R$ (otherwise, the claim is clear). Consider a collection $C$ of planks which consists of $m$ vertical planks $P_i$ and $n$ horizontal planks $Q_j$, where $m\\le n$ (otherwise we swap the vertical and horizontal coordinates) and $N=m+n\\ge 3$. I number the vertical planks $P_i$ from left to right. Without loss of generality, we can assume that vertical planks are pairwise disjoint and horizontal planks are also pairwise disjoint (otherwise, we amalgamate the non-disjoint vertical/horizontal planks, without increasing the total width $W$ and reducing the number of planks). \nFor the same reason, we can assume that any proper subset of $C$ does not cover $D$. The complement\n$$\nD\\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^m P_i\n$$\nis a union of convex sets $D_j$. I also number $D_j$'s from left to right. Each $D_j$ is covered by exactly one horizontal plank (by the disjointness property). Hence, the number $k$ of the convex sets $D_j$ is $\\le n$. Furthermore, $k\\in \\{m-1, m, m+1\\}$ since there exists exactly one $D_j$ between each consecutive pair $P_i, P_{i+1}$. Since $m\\le n$, it follows that at most one of the planks $Q_i$ covers two different components $D_j$, which means that\n$$\nk-1\\le n\\le k. \n$$\nBy combining these inequalities, we see that\n$$\nm\\le k\\le m+1,\n$$\nand, hence, either $P_1$ or $P_m$ does not contain one of the two vertical sides of $R$. (I assume that it is $P_1$ which does not contain $ab$, otherwise, we change the orientation.) Lastly, if $k=m$ (i.e, $P_m$ contains $cd$) then $n=k=m$ and, hence, each plank $Q_i$ covers exactly one of the components $D_j$. In any case, I let $Q_1$ denote the horizontal plank covering $D_1$. Case 1: $k=n$, i.e., each $Q_i$ covers exactly one $D_i$, $i=1,...,n$. As we noted above, \nthe  component $D_1$ has nonempty intersection with the vertical segment $ab$. Let $h_1$ denote the length of the projection $\\pi_2(D_1)\\subset ab$  and let $v_1$ denote the length of the projection $\\pi_1(D_1)$ of $D_1$. Since $D_1$ is covered by a $Q_1$, it is clear that width of $Q_1$ is $\\ge h_1$. Lemma 2. $v_1\\le h_1$. Proof. Consider a point $x\\in D_1\\cap ab$ and the segment $yz=D_1\\cap P_1$. The triangle $\\Delta=xyz$ is contained in $D_1$. Moreover, convexity of $D$ and the fact that it intersects all four sides of $R$ imply that the rays from $x$ extending the segments $xy$ and $xz$ both intersect the union of the horizontal segments $bc\\cup da$. It is then an elementary geometric calculation to conclude that the height $v_1$ (from the vertex $x$) of $T$ is $\\le $ the length of the base $yz$ of $T$. The latter is $\\le h_1$. qed. Let $P_0\\subset R$ denote the vertical plank which is the product $\\pi_1(D_1)\\times ab$ ($P_0$ is not a part of our collection $C$ of planks). By Lemma 1, the width of $P_0$ is $\\le$ the width of $Q_1$. Then replace $Q_1$ with $P_0\\cup P_1$. Since $Q_1$ covers only the component $D_1$, it follows that the new collection $C'$ of planks still covers $R$. By Lemma 1, $C'$ has overall width $W'\\le W$ and, by construction, $C'$ consists of $N-1$ planks. Therefore, by the induction assumption, $1\\le W'\\le W$ and we are done. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1 in Case 1. Case 2: $n=k-1$. Then $k=m+1$, $n=m$. Subcase 2a: $Q_1$ covers $D_1$ and (after renumbering if necessary) a distinct horizontal plank $Q_n$ covers $D_{n+1}$. Then we repeat the argument from Case 1 and conclude that $W\\ge 1$. Subcase 2a: $Q=Q_1$ covers both $D_1$ and $D_{n+1}$. We then switch roles of horizontal and vertical directions (this is OK since $n=m$).  Repeating the above case-by-case analysis we conclude that there exists a vertical plank  $P:=P_\\ell$ which covers two components $E_1, E_{n+1}$ of\n $$\n R\\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^n Q_i. \n $$\n The components $E_1, E_{n+1}$ have nonempty intersections with the horizontal sides of $R$. \n Now, pick from each subset $D_1, D_{m+1}, E_1, E_{n+1}$ one point $y_1, y_2, x_1, x_2$ which belongs to a side of $R$. Lemma 3. The convex hull $D'$ of $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$ is covered by the planks $P$ and $Q$. Proof. It suffices to show that every edge of $D'$ is contained in $K=P\\cup Q$. Suppose that there exists an edge of $D'$ (after relabeling, we can assume that this edge is $x_1y_1$) which is not contained in $P\\cup Q$. \nLet $x_1'\\in x_1y_1$ and $y_1'\\in x_1y_1$ be the points of intersection of the boundary of $K$ with $x_1y_1$  (these intersection points are labelled so that $x_1'$ belongs to the left side $s_1$ of $P$ and $y_1'$ belongs the bottom side $t_1$ of $Q$. Let $z_1'=s_1\\cap t_1$; then the solid right angled triangle $x_1'y_1'z_1'$ is not covered by $P\\cup Q$. However, by the disjointness property of planks, if follows that a small corner of $x_1'y_1'z_1'$ at the vertex $z_1'$ is not covered by any plank in $C$. Contradiction. qed. In view of Lemma 3, we can now apply Lemma 1 (since we have a covering of $D'$ by two planks) and conclude that the total width of $P$ and $Q$ is $\\ge 1$. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1. qed I gave a proof of Theorem 1 for finite collections of planks. An easy approximation argument implies that the same conclusion holds for countable collections of planks. (For uncountable collections, the statement is meaningless, as far as I can tell.) Theorem 1 is a special case of much harder theorem (theorem 2 below) proven by T.Bang in A solution to the \"Plank Problem \" , Proceedings of AMS, 2 (1951). The \"Plank Problem\" itself was posed by A.Tarski in 1932. Theorem 2: Let $D\\subset R^d$ be a bounded convex subset and $C$ is a countable collection of planks covering $D$. Then the total width of $C$ is $\\ge$ the width of $D$. Here are the definitions: A plank in $R^d$ is the closed region bounded by two parallel hyperplanes. The width of a plank is the distance between the hyperplanes. The total width of $C$ is the sum of width of planks in $C$. The width of $D$ is the infimum of lengths of its orthogonal projections to straight lines in $R^d$. Bang's proof is clever and nonelementary. It has led to a number of problems some of which are still open. Read here to find more about it.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about covering a convex set D in the unit square R = [0,1]^2 with planks that are parallel to the axes. Each plank is either a horizontal strip [a,b]×[0,1] or a vertical strip [0,1]×[a,b]. The goal is to show that the total area of these planks must be at least 1 if they cover D. \n\nFirst, let me parse the assumptions and the problem statement carefully. The key points here are:\n\n1. R is the unit square [0,1]^2.\n2. D is a convex subset of R.\n3. D intersects each side of R. So, D touches all four sides of the square. That probably means it's \"large enough\" in some sense, not just a small convex set somewhere in the middle.\n4. Planks are defined as either horizontal or vertical strips covering the entire width or height of the square. So a horizontal plank would span from left to right (or vice versa) with some interval [a,b] in the y-direction, and similarly a vertical plank spans from bottom to top with some [a,b] in the x-direction.\n5. The planks are covering D, so every point in D must be inside at least one plank.\n6. The problem is to prove that the sum of the areas of these planks is at least 1.\n\nThe hint mentions the Marriage theorem, which is a result from combinatorics related to matching in bipartite graphs. The Marriage theorem, or Hall's theorem, states that a bipartite graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset of one partition, the number of neighbors is at least as large as the subset. So, how does that relate here?\n\nLet me think about how to model this problem in a way that Hall's theorem could apply. Maybe we need to model the planks and the covering condition in terms of a bipartite graph where one partition corresponds to something related to D and the other to the planks. Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem by breaking D into points and the planks into sets covering those points, but since D is convex and intersects all sides, perhaps there's a more structural approach.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that each plank covers D in some strip. Since D is convex and touches all sides, perhaps any vertical or horizontal line through D must intersect D. That might not be the case, but if D is convex and intersects all sides, maybe it's a convex region that connects opposite sides? For example, like a convex shape that goes from the left to the right side, and from the bottom to the top. So, maybe it's similar to a convex set that must cross the square in both directions.\n\nBut how does the area come into play? The total area of the planks is the sum over each plank of its area. For a horizontal plank [a,b]×[0,1], the area is (b - a)*1 = b - a. Similarly, a vertical plank [0,1]×[a,b] has area (b - a)*1 = b - a. So each plank's area is just the length of the interval [a,b].\n\nThe total area of all planks is the sum of these lengths. We need to show that this sum is at least 1.\n\nIf we can model this as a covering problem where the required \"total length\" is at least 1, then maybe we can relate it to some measure or use duality.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the Marriage theorem, perhaps we can model the problem as a bipartite graph where one set is the set of \"directions\" (horizontal and vertical) and the other set is the set of intervals, but that might not directly apply.\n\nWait, another thought: The problem is similar to the plank problem in geometry, where covering a convex body with planks (regions between two parallel hyperplanes) requires that the sum of their widths is at least the minimal width of the body. But in this case, the planks are axis-aligned and cover the entire side of the square. Maybe there's a connection here.\n\nIn the classic plank problem, if you have a convex body and cover it with planks (strips between two hyperplanes), the sum of the widths must be at least the minimal width of the body. But in our case, the convex set D is inside the unit square, which might have different constraints. However, since D intersects all four sides, maybe the minimal width in some direction is 1, but the planks are axis-aligned. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that D intersects each side, so projections of D onto both axes must cover the entire interval [0,1]. Because if D is convex and intersects all four sides, then the projection onto the x-axis must be [0,1], and similarly for the y-axis. Let me check that.\n\nSuppose D is a convex set in [0,1]^2 that intersects the left side (x=0), right side (x=1), bottom (y=0), and top (y=1). Then, the projection of D onto the x-axis is the set {x | there exists y such that (x,y) ∈ D}. Since D is convex, this projection is an interval. But since D intersects x=0 and x=1, the projection must include x=0 and x=1, hence the projection is [0,1]. Similarly, the projection onto the y-axis is [0,1].\n\nSo, the projections of D onto both axes are full intervals [0,1]. That might be important.\n\nNow, each horizontal plank [a,b]×[0,1] covers the vertical strip from a to b in the x-direction. The intersection of such a plank with D would be the part of D where x ∈ [a,b]. Similarly, a vertical plank [0,1]×[a,b] covers the horizontal strip from a to b in the y-direction, so the intersection with D is the part of D where y ∈ [a,b].\n\nBut we need to cover all of D with such planks. The total area (i.e., total length) of the planks is the sum of (b_i - a_i) for each plank. We need to show that this sum is at least 1.\n\nIf we think of each horizontal plank as covering an interval on the x-axis projection, and each vertical plank as covering an interval on the y-axis projection, then perhaps the covering of D requires that the union of the x-intervals from horizontal planks and the y-intervals from vertical planks must cover both [0,1] projections? But that might not be the case, because a point in D could be covered by either a horizontal or vertical plank. So, for example, a point (x,y) in D can be covered by a horizontal plank that includes x in its x-interval, or a vertical plank that includes y in its y-interval.\n\nTherefore, the covering of D can be achieved by a combination of horizontal and vertical planks such that for every (x,y) in D, either x is in some horizontal plank's interval or y is in some vertical plank's interval.\n\nThis seems similar to a covering in terms of the union of the x-projections of horizontal planks and y-projections of vertical planks covering the projections of D. But since the projections are already [0,1], but the covering is in a combined way.\n\nWait, but actually, since D's projections are full [0,1], then to cover D, the union of the x-intervals from horizontal planks and the y-intervals from vertical planks must cover [0,1] in both directions? Not necessarily. Because a point (x,y) in D can be covered by a horizontal plank covering x or a vertical plank covering y. So, for each x in [0,1], if there is a horizontal plank covering x, then all points in D with that x-coordinate are covered. Similarly, for each y in [0,1], if there is a vertical plank covering y, then all points in D with that y-coordinate are covered.\n\nTherefore, the union of the x-intervals (from horizontal planks) and the union of the y-intervals (from vertical planks) must cover [0,1]. Wait, no. Because even if x is not covered by any horizontal plank, as long as y is covered by a vertical plank for that particular y, the point (x,y) is covered. So the requirement is that for every (x,y) in D, either x is in some horizontal plank or y is in some vertical plank. But since D has full projections, for every x in [0,1], there exists some y such that (x,y) is in D, and similarly for y. Therefore, if a horizontal plank does not cover x, then for that x, there must be a vertical plank that covers all y such that (x,y) is in D. But since D intersects the top and bottom, for each x, there are points in D with y=0 and y=1, so if x is not covered by a horizontal plank, then the vertical planks must cover y=0 and y=1 for that x, but that seems impossible unless the vertical planks cover the entire y-interval. Wait, no. Wait, for a given x, if there is no horizontal plank covering x, then for all y such that (x,y) is in D, those points must be covered by vertical planks. But since D is convex and intersects the top and bottom, the set of y's for a fixed x is an interval (due to convexity), and since D intersects y=0 and y=1, that interval must be the entire [0,1]. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, suppose D is convex and intersects all four sides. Take a fixed x in [0,1]. Then, the intersection of D with the vertical line x is a convex subset of that line, i.e., an interval. Since D intersects the top and bottom sides (y=0 and y=1), there are points (x,0) and (x,1) in D? Not necessarily. Wait, D intersects each side, but not necessarily at every x. For example, D might intersect the left side at some point (0, y1), the right side at (1, y2), the bottom at (x1, 0), and the top at (x2, 1), but it might not necessarily cover the entire top or bottom. Wait, but actually, if D is convex and intersects all four sides, then the intersection with each side is a convex set (a line segment). So, for example, the intersection with the left side x=0 is a vertical line segment from (0, a) to (0, b) where 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤1. Similarly for the other sides.\n\nBut the projection onto the x-axis is [0,1], as we established earlier. Similarly, the projection onto the y-axis is [0,1]. So for every x in [0,1], there exists some y such that (x,y) is in D, and similarly for y.\n\nBut for a fixed x, the set of y's such that (x,y) is in D is an interval (since D is convex). However, since D intersects the top and bottom sides (y=0 and y=1), does that mean that for every x, this interval includes y=0 and y=1? No, that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose D is a diamond shape in the center of the square, touching all four sides but not reaching the corners. Then, for x=0, the intersection with D is a single point (since it touches the left side at one point), say (0, 0.5). Similarly, for x=1, it touches at (1, 0.5). For the bottom side, it touches at (0.5, 0), and for the top at (0.5, 1). So the projection onto the x-axis is [0,1], but for a given x ≠ 0.5, the vertical slice might be a smaller interval around 0.5. So, in this case, the vertical slices (for fixed x) are intervals that might not include y=0 or y=1 except at specific x's.\n\nTherefore, the earlier conclusion that for each x, the vertical slice is an interval, but not necessarily covering the entire y-axis. So, if we have a point (x,y) in D, to cover it, we need either a horizontal plank covering x or a vertical plank covering y. \n\nIf we think of this as a covering problem, for each (x,y) in D, either x is covered by a horizontal plank or y is covered by a vertical plank. Now, the total area of the planks is the sum of the lengths of the horizontal intervals plus the sum of the lengths of the vertical intervals. We need to show that this sum is at least 1.\n\nThe hint mentions the Marriage theorem. So, how can we model this as a bipartite graph matching problem?\n\nLet's consider the following approach: Let’s create a bipartite graph where one partition corresponds to the x-coordinates in [0,1] and the other partition corresponds to the y-coordinates in [0,1]. We can then connect x to y if the point (x,y) is in D. Then, a horizontal plank covering an interval I in the x-direction would correspond to covering all x in I, and a vertical plank covering an interval J in the y-direction would correspond to covering all y in J. The problem then reduces to covering all edges in this bipartite graph by selecting subsets I and J such that every edge (x,y) has x in I or y in J. The total cost is the sum of the lengths of I and J, and we need to show that the minimal total cost is at least 1.\n\nHowever, the problem allows multiple planks, so we can have multiple intervals in x and y. So, the total cost is the sum of lengths of all horizontal intervals plus the sum of lengths of all vertical intervals. We need to show that this sum is at least 1.\n\nIn terms of the Marriage theorem, which involves matching, perhaps we need to find a matching between x and y such that each edge is \"covered\" by either x or y, and then relate the total cost to the size of the matching. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for each x in [0,1], we can associate the set S_x of y's such that (x,y) is in D. Similarly, for each y, the set T_y of x's such that (x,y) is in D. Since D is convex, each S_x is an interval, and each T_y is also an interval.\n\nNow, to cover D, we need that for every x, either x is covered by a horizontal plank, or S_x is covered by vertical planks. Similarly, for every y, either y is covered by a vertical plank, or T_y is covered by horizontal planks. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but since D has full projections, for every x, S_x is non-empty, and for every y, T_y is non-empty. Moreover, due to convexity, these sets are intervals.\n\nLet’s think of it in terms of measure. Suppose we have a collection of horizontal planks covering intervals X_1, X_2, ..., X_m in the x-direction, and vertical planks covering intervals Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n in the y-direction. The union of the X_i's is some subset X of [0,1], and the union of the Y_j's is some subset Y of [0,1]. The condition is that for every (x,y) in D, x ∈ X or y ∈ Y. We need to show that the measure of X plus the measure of Y is at least 1.\n\nThis is starting to resemble a duality in measure theory, but I need to relate it to the Marriage theorem.\n\nThe Marriage theorem (Hall's theorem) states that for a bipartite graph with partitions A and B, there exists a matching covering A if and only if for every subset S of A, the number of neighbors of S is at least |S|.\n\nBut in our case, we need to cover the edges with nodes from one side or the other. It’s a covering problem, not a matching problem. However, there is a duality between covering and matching in bipartite graphs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a hypergraph where each edge is a point (x,y) in D, and hyperedges are the horizontal planks (covering all points with x in X_i) and vertical planks (covering all points with y in Y_j). Then the problem is to cover the hyperedges with the minimum total length, which is equivalent to a hitting set problem. However, hypergraph hitting set is generally hard, but perhaps here we can exploit the structure.\n\nAnother angle: Since D is convex and intersects all sides, it might have a high area, but the problem doesn’t specify anything about the area of D. However, the minimal total plank area is 1, which is the area of the unit square. So even if D is the entire square, covering it with planks would require total area at least 1, which is achieved by the square itself. But if D is a smaller convex set, why would the total area still need to be at least 1? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, no. The problem states that D is a convex set intersecting each side, but it's possible that D is very thin. For example, imagine a very thin diagonal strip from near (0,0) to (1,1), but still touching all four sides. Then, covering D with planks might require covering its projection on both axes, but since it's thin, maybe you can cover it with planks of small total area. However, the problem claims that the total area must be at least 1, which suggests that no matter how D is arranged (as long as it's convex and touches all sides), you can't cover it with planks of total area less than 1.\n\nThis makes me think that the key lies in the fact that D's projections are full [0,1] intervals, and somehow the planks' coverage must cover these projections in a way that their total lengths add up to at least 1. But how?\n\nLet’s think of the horizontal planks covering some parts of the x-axis and vertical planks covering some parts of the y-axis. The total length (measure) of the x-coverage plus the y-coverage must be at least 1. Is that necessarily true? For example, if I cover the entire x-axis with a horizontal plank of length 1, then vertical planks aren't needed, total area is 1. Similarly, if I cover the entire y-axis with a vertical plank of length 1, total area is 1. If I cover parts of both, say 0.5 on the x-axis and 0.5 on the y-axis, total area is 1. If I cover less than 1 in total, say 0.8, then there must be some part of the x and y axes not covered, but since D's projections are full, there must be points in D that are not covered, which contradicts the covering.\n\nWait, suppose that the union of the horizontal plank intervals on the x-axis has measure μ and the union of the vertical plank intervals on the y-axis has measure ν. Then the total area of the planks is μ + ν. If μ + ν < 1, then there exists a subset of the x-axis of measure 1 - ν not covered by horizontal planks, and similarly a subset of the y-axis of measure 1 - μ not covered by vertical planks. But since D's projections are full, there must be points (x,y) in D where x is not covered by horizontal planks (i.e., x is in the complement of measure 1 - ν) and y is not covered by vertical planks (y is in the complement of measure 1 - μ). If the product of these complements ( (1 - ν)(1 - μ) ) is greater than zero, then there exists some (x,y) in the projections such that x is not covered and y is not covered, hence (x,y) is not covered by any plank, which contradicts the covering. Therefore, to avoid this, we must have that (1 - ν)(1 - μ) = 0, which implies that either μ = 1 or ν = 1. But if μ + ν < 1, then both 1 - ν > 0 and 1 - μ > 0, so their product is positive, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, μ + ν ≥ 1.\n\nWait, this seems like a promising approach. Let me formalize it:\n\nLet μ be the measure of the union of horizontal planks on the x-axis, and ν the measure of the vertical planks on the y-axis. The total area of the planks is μ + ν. Suppose for contradiction that μ + ν < 1. Then, the measure of the complement of the horizontal planks is 1 - μ, and the complement of the vertical planks is 1 - ν. Since D projects onto the entire x-axis and y-axis, there must be points in D with x-coordinate in the complement of the horizontal planks (measure 1 - μ) and y-coordinate in the complement of the vertical planks (measure 1 - ν). By the projection property, the set of such x's and y's is non-empty. However, we need to ensure that there exists a point (x,y) in D where x is in the complement of horizontal planks and y is in the complement of vertical planks. If such a point exists, then it's not covered by any plank, which contradicts the covering assumption.\n\nBut does such a point necessarily exist? The projections are independent. The x's not covered by horizontal planks have measure 1 - μ, and y's not covered by vertical planks have measure 1 - ν. However, the existence of a point (x,y) in D with x in the x-complement and y in the y-complement requires that the intersection of these complements is non-empty in D. But D is a convex set with full projections. How can we guarantee that?\n\nThis is similar to the argument in measure theory that if A and B are subsets of [0,1] with measure > 0, then A × B has positive measure in [0,1]^2. However, D is not necessarily the entire square. But D is convex and intersects all sides, which might imply that it contains a rectangle or something similar.\n\nWait, if D is convex and intersects all four sides of the unit square, does it necessarily contain a point (x,y) where x is in the complement of horizontal planks and y is in the complement of vertical planks? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose the horizontal planks cover measure μ on the x-axis, and vertical planks cover measure ν on the y-axis. If μ + ν < 1, then 1 - μ > ν and 1 - ν > μ. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the product (1 - μ)(1 - ν) > 0, so there is some area in the square not covered by the planks. But since D is convex and has full projections, it must intersect every vertical and horizontal line, so perhaps it must pass through this uncovered area?\n\nActually, no. If there is a rectangle in the square not covered by any plank, i.e., x ∈ [a,b] and y ∈ [c,d] where [a,b] is not covered by horizontal planks and [c,d] is not covered by vertical planks, then since D is convex and intersects all sides, does it necessarily pass through this rectangle? Not necessarily. For example, D could be a very thin convex set that snakes around the covered areas. However, since D has full projections, for every x, there is a y such that (x,y) ∈ D, and vice versa. So, if there's an x not covered by horizontal planks, there must be a y such that (x,y) ∈ D, and if that y is not covered by vertical planks, then (x,y) is not covered. So, the existence of such an x and y would imply an uncovered point.\n\nBut how do we guarantee that for some x not covered, there exists a y not covered such that (x,y) ∈ D?\n\nThis seems related to the theory of cross sections and measures. Maybe we can use Fubini's theorem or some integral argument. Let’s denote H as the union of horizontal planks and V as the union of vertical planks. Then, the total area of planks is μ + ν, where μ = measure(H) and ν = measure(V). The uncovered points are the complement of H × [0,1] union [0,1] × V, which is the set ([0,1] \\ H) × ([0,1] \\ V). The area of this set is (1 - μ)(1 - ν). If μ + ν < 1, then (1 - μ)(1 - ν) > 0, so there exists a positive area in the square not covered by planks. However, D is a convex set with full projections. Does this imply that D must intersect this uncovered area?\n\nBut D could have measure zero. For example, D could be a line segment connecting (0,0) to (1,1), which is convex and intersects all four sides (wait, does it? It connects two corners, so it intersects two sides, not all four. To intersect all four sides, a convex set must meet each of the four edges. So, for example, a convex polygon that has at least one point on each side.)\n\nSuppose D is a convex polygon with a point on each side. Then, D's projection onto both axes is [0,1]. But even so, D could still be a thin quadrilateral that doesn't enter the uncovered region. However, if there's a positive area uncovered, but D is a convex set with full projections, then intuitively, D must pass through every part of the square. But I need a formal argument.\n\nAlternatively, since D is convex and has full projections, it must contain a point in every row and column. So, if there's a column (vertical line x) not covered by horizontal planks, then D must have points in that column, and if those points' y-coordinates are not covered by vertical planks, then they are uncovered. But how do we ensure that there's at least one column and row where both are uncovered?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the earlier measure-theoretic argument is sufficient if we can show that if μ + ν < 1, then D must intersect the uncovered area ([0,1] \\ H) × ([0,1] \\ V). Since D has full projections, for every x in [0,1] \\ H (which has measure 1 - μ > 0), there exists y such that (x,y) ∈ D. Similarly, for every y in [0,1] \\ V (measure 1 - ν > 0), there exists x such that (x,y) ∈ D. But we need a point (x,y) where x ∈ [0,1] \\ H and y ∈ [0,1] \\ V.\n\nIs there a guarantee that such a point exists in D? Suppose not. Then, for every x ∈ [0,1] \\ H, all y with (x,y) ∈ D must be in V. Similarly, for every y ∈ [0,1] \\ V, all x with (x,y) ∈ D must be in H. \n\nBut since D has full projections, the set {x | ∃ y, (x,y) ∈ D} = [0,1], and {y | ∃ x, (x,y) ∈ D} = [0,1]. So, the sections D_x = {y | (x,y) ∈ D} are non-empty for every x, and D_y = {x | (x,y) ∈ D} are non-empty for every y. Moreover, since D is convex, each D_x is an interval, and each D_y is an interval.\n\nNow, suppose that μ + ν < 1. Then [0,1] \\ H has measure 1 - μ > 0 and [0,1] \\ V has measure 1 - ν > 0. Consider the product measure of these two sets: (1 - μ)(1 - ν) > 0. If we can show that D intersects this product set, then we have a contradiction, because such a point would not be covered by any plank.\n\nTo show that D intersects ([0,1] \\ H) × ([0,1] \\ V), we might use the fact that D has full projections and is convex. Let’s consider the sections D_x for x ∈ [0,1] \\ H. For each such x, D_x is an interval in [0,1]. If all these intervals were contained within V, then V would need to cover the union of all D_x for x ∈ [0,1] \\ H. But the measure of V is ν < 1 - μ (since μ + ν < 1), and the union of D_x over x ∈ [0,1] \\ H would require a measure of at least the measure of [0,1] \\ H times the minimal height of D_x. However, since D is convex and intersects the top and bottom, perhaps each D_x has at least some minimal height?\n\nWait, let’s think about it. Since D is convex and intersects the top and bottom sides of the square, there exists points (x1, 1) and (x2, 0) in D. By convexity, the line segment connecting these two points must lie entirely within D. Depending on x1 and x2, this line segment might have a certain slope. Similarly, there are points on the left and right sides.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean that each vertical slice D_x has a large height. For example, if D is a very thin diagonal strip, then each D_x might be a small interval around y = x or something. \n\nBut maybe we can apply some integral geometry here. The area of D can be expressed as the integral over x of the length of D_x. Since D has full projections, the integral of the length of D_x over x is the area of D. Similarly for y. But we don't have any information about the area of D.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if for each x ∈ [0,1] \\ H, D_x is contained in V, then the measure of V must be at least the average length of D_x over x ∈ [0,1] \\ H. But since D is convex, the function f(x) = length(D_x) is concave (by Brunn-Minkowski theorem?), which implies that the minimal average is achieved at the extremes. However, this might be too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for each x ∈ [0,1] \\ H, the vertical slice D_x is contained in V. Then, since D_x is an interval, and V is the union of vertical planks, which are intervals in the y-direction, the measure of V must be at least the maximal length of D_x over x ∈ [0,1] \\ H. But this isn't necessarily true. If D_x varies in length, V only needs to cover the union of all D_x for x ∈ [0,1] \\ H.\n\nBut the problem is we don't know how these D_x's are arranged. If they are all disjoint in y, then the measure of V would need to be at least the sum of their lengths, but they could overlap.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me try to think back to the Marriage theorem. The Marriage theorem involves finding a matching that covers one partition of a bipartite graph. How can we relate that to our problem?\n\nSuppose we create a bipartite graph where one partition is the set of vertical lines in D and the other partition is the set of horizontal lines in D. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, consider the following approach inspired by the Marriage theorem:\n\nLet’s model the problem as a bipartite graph with two partitions: one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. Each point (x,y) in D is an edge connecting x in the x-axis partition to y in the y-axis partition. Covering D with planks corresponds to covering all edges either by selecting x in horizontal planks or y in vertical planks. The total cost is the sum of the lengths of the selected intervals. We need to show that this cost is at least 1.\n\nBy the Marriage theorem, for a bipartite graph, the minimum size of a vertex cover (a set of vertices that touches all edges) is equal to the maximum size of a matching. However, in our case, the vertex cover is a set of x's and y's such that every edge (x,y) has x in the cover or y in the cover. The size of the vertex cover in the discrete case is the number of vertices, but here we have a continuous setting. \n\nBut perhaps there's a continuous analog. If we consider the measure of the vertex cover (μ + ν), then the problem is to show that μ + ν ≥ 1. This resembles the conclusion we want. The Marriage theorem in this context might relate to the fact that the maximum matching in some way corresponds to the minimum vertex cover. But I'm not sure about the continuous version.\n\nAlternatively, think of it in terms of duality. The total plank area μ + ν is the cost, and we want to minimize this cost subject to covering all edges in D. The dual problem would be to find a \"fractional matching\" that maximizes the integral over D of some function subject to constraints. By strong duality, the minimum cost equals the maximum matching. If we can show that the maximum matching is at least 1, then the minimum cost is at least 1.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with continuous linear programming duality to make this precise.\n\nAnother approach: Let's use the probabilistic method. Suppose that the total plank area is μ + ν < 1. Then, the expected number of planks covering a random point (x,y) in D is less than 1. But since D is covered by planks, every point must be covered by at least one plank. However, this doesn't directly lead to a contradiction because the expectation is over the entire square, not over D.\n\nAlternatively, consider choosing a random point (x,y) uniformly in D. The probability that x is covered by a horizontal plank is μ, and the probability that y is covered by a vertical plank is ν. Since the total area of planks is μ + ν, and they might overlap, the probability that a random point is covered is at most μ + ν. But since D is covered, this probability must be 1. Therefore, μ + ν ≥ 1.\n\nWait, this seems like a good argument! Let me flesh it out.\n\nAssume that the horizontal planks cover a set H ⊂ [0,1] with μ = measure(H), and vertical planks cover a set V ⊂ [0,1] with ν = measure(V). The total area of the planks is μ + ν. Now, consider the uniform measure over D. For a random point (x,y) in D, the probability that x ∈ H or y ∈ V is 1 (since the planks cover D). \n\nOn the other hand, the probability that x ∈ H or y ∈ V is less than or equal to the probability that x ∈ H plus the probability that y ∈ V (by union bound). The probability that x ∈ H is measure(H ∩ proj_x(D)) / measure(D). But proj_x(D) is [0,1], so it's measure(H) / 1 = μ, assuming the uniform distribution over x. Similarly, the probability that y ∈ V is ν. However, these probabilities are not independent, so we can't simply add them. Wait, but if we assume uniform distribution over D, the probability that x ∈ H is the measure of H in the x-projection weighted by the conditional distribution of y given x. This seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for any probability measure, P(A ∨ B) ≤ P(A) + P(B). Since the planks cover D, P(x ∈ H ∨ y ∈ V) = 1. Therefore, 1 ≤ P(x ∈ H) + P(y ∈ V). But P(x ∈ H) is the measure of H divided by the width of the projection, which is 1, so P(x ∈ H) = μ. Similarly, P(y ∈ V) = ν. Therefore, 1 ≤ μ + ν, which implies μ + ν ≥ 1. Hence, the total area of the planks is at least 1.\n\nThis is a beautiful argument! It uses the probabilistic method and the union bound. The key insight is that the coverage probability must be 1, and the union bound gives that this probability is at most μ + ν. Therefore, μ + ν ≥ 1.\n\nBut does this hold when considering the uniform distribution over D? Wait, no. The probabilities P(x ∈ H) and P(y ∈ V) are with respect to the distribution over D. If D has a non-uniform density, then these probabilities would not necessarily be μ and ν. For example, if D is concentrated in a region where x is often in H or y is often in V, then P(x ∈ H) + P(y ∈ V) could be greater than μ + ν. However, in our case, since D has full projections, the marginal distributions of x and y are over the entire [0,1]. If H has measure μ, then the marginal probability that x ∈ H is at least μ times the minimal density of x in D. But since D's projection is uniform (not necessarily), but we don't know that.\n\nActually, this approach might not be valid unless we can assume uniform distribution, which we can't. However, there's a different way to think about it using integral geometry.\n\nConsider the measure of the set H × [0,1] union [0,1] × V. The total area covered by the planks is μ + ν - μν, because the overlap H × V has area μν. So, the area not covered is 1 - (μ + ν - μν) = (1 - μ)(1 - ν). If μ + ν < 1, then this uncovered area is positive. However, since D is a subset of [0,1]^2, if the uncovered area intersects D, then there's a contradiction. But D might not intersect the uncovered area. \n\nHowever, since D has full projections, for every x ∈ [0,1] \\ H, there exists y such that (x,y) ∈ D, and for every y ∈ [0,1] \\ V, there exists x such that (x,y) ∈ D. If there exists an x ∈ [0,1] \\ H and a y ∈ [0,1] \\ V s",
