    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a group G with elements a and b. The conditions given are that a squared is the identity element, so a² = e, and then there's this other relation: ab⁴a = b⁷. We need to prove that b³³ = e. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since a² = e, that means a is its own inverse. So, applying a twice brings us back to the identity. That might be useful for manipulating the equation ab⁴a = b⁷. Let me think about how to handle that equation. Maybe we can conjugate b⁴ by a here. In group theory, conjugation often involves elements like aba⁻¹, but since a is its own inverse, a⁻¹ is just a. So, ab⁴a is the same as a b⁴ a, which would be like conjugating b⁴ by a. The result of that conjugation is given as b⁷. So, we have a b⁴ a = b⁷. \n\nLet me write that as: a b⁴ a = b⁷. Since a² = e, maybe we can multiply both sides by a on the left and right to see if that helps. Wait, but a is already on both sides. Let's try rearranging the equation. If I multiply both sides on the left by a⁻¹ (which is a) and on the right by a⁻¹ (also a), then we get b⁴ = a b⁷ a. Hmm, but is that helpful? Let me check. Starting from a b⁴ a = b⁷, multiply both sides on the left by a: a² b⁴ a = a b⁷. Since a² = e, this simplifies to b⁴ a = a b⁷. Then multiply both sides on the right by a: b⁴ a² = a b⁷ a. Again, since a² = e, this gives b⁴ = a b⁷ a. So we have b⁴ = a b⁴ a = b⁷? Wait, no. Wait, original equation is a b⁴ a = b⁷. So starting from there, maybe we can manipulate the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b⁷ in terms of conjugation. Let's denote the conjugation of x by a as xᵃ = a x a⁻¹. Since a⁻¹ = a here, then xᵃ = a x a. So, the equation becomes (b⁴)ᵃ = b⁷. So, conjugating b⁴ by a gives b⁷. That might be useful. Now, conjugation is an automorphism, so it preserves group operations. Therefore, (b⁴)ᵃ = (bᵃ)⁴ = b⁷. So, if we let c = bᵃ, then c⁴ = b⁷. But c is just a conjugate of b, so c and b have the same order. Wait, but maybe not necessarily, unless the group is abelian, which we don't know. So perhaps that's a wrong path.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express b in terms of a. Let's see. If we have a b⁴ a = b⁷, then we can write b⁴ = a b⁷ a. Then substitute this back into itself? Maybe not. Let's see. Let's take the original equation: a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's try to raise both sides to some power to get relations. For example, if we raise both sides to the 4th power, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe express b⁷ in terms of b⁴ and then find some exponent that leads to b³³.\n\nAlternatively, let's manipulate the equation a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's multiply both sides on the left by a, so we get a² b⁴ a = a b⁷. Since a² = e, this becomes b⁴ a = a b⁷. Then, multiply both sides on the right by a: b⁴ a² = a b⁷ a. Again, since a² = e, this gives b⁴ = a b⁷ a. Wait, but this is the same as the original equation. Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that a b⁴ a = b⁷ to express b⁷ in terms of b⁴ and then find some relation. Let's rearrange the equation as b⁷ = a b⁴ a. Let's see if we can express higher powers of b in terms of lower ones. For example, maybe compute b¹⁴: that would be (b⁷)² = (a b⁴ a)² = a b⁴ a a b⁴ a = a b⁴ a² b⁴ a = a b⁴ e b⁴ a = a b⁸ a. So, b¹⁴ = a b⁸ a. But from the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷, so substituting back, a b⁸ a would be a b⁴ b⁴ a = (a b⁴ a)(a b⁴ a) = b⁷ * b⁷ = b¹⁴. Wait, so this seems like it's just confirming that b¹⁴ = a b⁸ a. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to find the order of b. Let's denote the order of b as n, so that bⁿ = e. We need to show that n divides 33, i.e., that b³³ = e. So, if we can find that n divides 33, which is 3*11, so primes 3 and 11. So, perhaps we need to show that b³ = e and b¹¹ = e, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, show that b³³ is e directly through exponent manipulation.\n\nLet me try another approach. Starting with a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's conjugate both sides by a. Since conjugation is an isomorphism, we can apply it again. But since a is its own inverse, conjugating by a again would give:\n\n(a b⁴ a)^a = (b⁷)^a.\n\nBut (a b⁴ a)^a = a (a b⁴ a) a = a² b⁴ a² = e b⁴ e = b⁴.\n\nOn the other hand, (b⁷)^a = a b⁷ a.\n\nSo we have b⁴ = a b⁷ a. But from the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷. So substituting a b⁴ a for b⁷ in the above equation, we get b⁴ = a (a b⁴ a) a = a² b⁴ a² = e b⁴ e = b⁴. So that's just an identity. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe raise both sides of the original equation to some power. For example, let's take a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's compute b⁷ again. If we manipulate the equation to express b in terms of a, maybe. Alternatively, consider solving for b⁴. From a b⁴ a = b⁷, multiply both sides on the left by a: b⁴ a = a b⁷. Then multiply both sides on the right by a⁻¹ (which is a): b⁴ = a b⁷ a⁻¹. Wait, but a⁻¹ is a, so this is the same as b⁴ = a b⁷ a. But that's the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that a b⁴ a = b⁷ implies that b⁴ is conjugate to b⁷. Therefore, they have the same order. But the order of b⁴ is n/gcd(n,4), and the order of b⁷ is n/gcd(n,7). Therefore, n/gcd(n,4) = n/gcd(n,7). So, this implies that gcd(n,4) = gcd(n,7). Since 4 and 7 are coprime, gcd(n,4) and gcd(n,7) must divide n. But since 4 and 7 are coprime, the only way their gcds with n are equal is if they are both 1. Because gcd(n,4) can be 1, 2, 4, and gcd(n,7) can be 1 or 7. So, if gcd(n,4) = gcd(n,7), then they must both be 1. Hence, gcd(n,4) = 1 and gcd(n,7)=1. Therefore, n must be coprime with 4 and 7. But how does this help us? Well, if n is coprime with 4 and 7, then n is coprime with 28. But we need to show that b³³ = e. So, if n divides 33, then n must divide 33. Wait, but 33 and 28 are coprime. I'm not sure if this approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. If b⁴ and b⁷ have the same order, then the order of b⁴ is equal to the order of b⁷. Let me denote the order of b as m. Then, the order of b⁴ is m / gcd(m,4), and the order of b⁷ is m / gcd(m,7). Setting them equal:\n\nm / gcd(m,4) = m / gcd(m,7).\n\nCanceling m (assuming m ≠ 0, which it isn't in a group), we get 1 / gcd(m,4) = 1 / gcd(m,7), which implies gcd(m,4) = gcd(m,7). Let's analyze this.\n\nPossible values for gcd(m,4) are 1, 2, 4.\n\nPossible values for gcd(m,7) are 1, 7.\n\nTherefore, the only way gcd(m,4) = gcd(m,7) is if both are 1. Therefore, gcd(m,4) = 1 and gcd(m,7) = 1. Hence, m must be coprime with 4 and 7, meaning m divides some number coprime to 28. But how does that relate to 33?\n\nWait, 33 is 3*11. So, if m is coprime with 28 (which factors into 2²*7), then m must be coprime with 2 and 7. Therefore, m divides a number that is a product of primes other than 2 and 7. But 33 is 3*11, which are primes not in 2 or 7, so if m divides 33, then m would indeed be coprime with 4 and 7. But does this necessarily mean that m divides 33? Not exactly, but perhaps combining this with another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can manipulate the equations to find a relation that leads to b³³ = e.\n\nLet me go back to the original equation: a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's try to express higher powers of b using this relation. For instance, let's compute b⁷ in terms of a and b⁴. Then, perhaps express b¹⁴, b²⁸, etc., and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's compute b⁷:\n\nb⁷ = a b⁴ a.\n\nNow, let's compute b¹⁴:\n\nb¹⁴ = (b⁷)² = (a b⁴ a)(a b⁴ a) = a b⁴ (a a) b⁴ a = a b⁴ e b⁴ a = a b⁸ a.\n\nBut from the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷, so a b⁸ a would be a b⁴ b⁴ a = (a b⁴ a)(a b⁴ a) = b⁷ * b⁷ = b¹⁴. So that's consistent. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute b⁷ again and see if we can relate it to higher powers. Let's try to compute b⁷⁴ or something, but maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, let's see if we can express b in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that a is an involution (a² = e) and consider the group generated by a and b. Since a and b are elements of G, the group generated by them is a subgroup of G, so we can consider relations there.\n\nLet me think of some Tietze transformations or substitution. Suppose we write the relation ab⁴a = b⁷. Let's try to isolate b. Let's rewrite the equation as ab⁴a b⁻⁷ = e. So, ab⁴a b⁻⁷ = e. Let's see if we can manipulate this word to find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider taking powers of b. Suppose we raise both sides of the equation a b⁴ a = b⁷ to the 4th power. Then we get (a b⁴ a)^4 = b²⁸. Expanding the left side:\n\n(a b⁴ a)^4 = a b⁴ a a b⁴ a a b⁴ a a b⁴ a = a b⁴ (a a) b⁴ (a a) b⁴ (a a) b⁴ a = a b⁴ e b⁴ e b⁴ e b⁴ a = a b¹⁶ a.\n\nSo, a b¹⁶ a = b²⁸. But from the original equation, we know that a b⁴ a = b⁷, so perhaps substituting. Let's see, a b¹⁶ a = (a b⁴ a)^4 = (b⁷)^4 = b²⁸. So that's the same as before. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express b¹⁶ in terms of a and b²⁸. From a b¹⁶ a = b²⁸, multiply both sides by a on the left and right: a a b¹⁶ a a = a b²⁸ a. Which simplifies to b¹⁶ = a b²⁸ a. But from the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷, so maybe b²⁸ is (b⁷)^4 = (a b⁴ a)^4 = a b¹⁶ a. So, this seems circular.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe try to find a direct exponent that gives us 33. Let's see, 33 is 7*4 + 5, not sure. Alternatively, note that 33 is 3*11. Maybe if we can find that b³ = e and b¹¹ = e, then b³³ = e. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider combining the given relation with the fact that a² = e. Let's try to compute (ab⁴a) and see if we can manipulate it. Wait, we already know that's b⁷. Let's try to compute a different conjugation. For example, conjugate b by a: a b a. Maybe that's helpful. Let's see. Let's compute (a b a)^k and see if we can relate it to something.\n\nBut we don't have a direct relation for a b a. Alternatively, let's assume that a and b commute? But we don't know if the group is abelian. Probably not, since the problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, but maybe the relations force some commutation. Let's see. Suppose we start with a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's try to compute a b a. Let's denote c = a b a. Then, c = a b a. Let's compute c⁴:\n\nc⁴ = (a b a)^4 = a b (a a) b (a a) b (a a) b a = a b e b e b e b a = a b⁴ a = b⁷. So, c⁴ = b⁷. But c is a conjugate of b, so c and b have the same order. Let's denote the order of b as m. Then, the order of c is also m. Therefore, c⁴ = b⁷ implies that (c⁴)^m = e, which is automatically true since c^m = e. Similarly, (b⁷)^m = e. But this might not give us new information.\n\nAlternatively, since c⁴ = b⁷, and c has order m, then c⁴m = e. But since c^m = e, then c⁴m = (c^m)^4 = e^4 = e. Similarly, (b⁷)^m = e. But b has order m, so b⁷m = e. But since b^m = e, then b⁷m = (b^m)^7 = e^7 = e. So again, this doesn't give new info.\n\nAlternatively, since c⁴ = b⁷ and c = a b a, maybe we can find a relation between b and c. For example, since c = a b a, then a c a = a (a b a) a = a² b a² = e b e = b. So, b = a c a. Then, substituting into c⁴ = b⁷, we get c⁴ = (a c a)^7. Let's expand (a c a)^7:\n\n(a c a)^7 = a c (a a) c (a a) ... c a = a c e c e ... c a = a c⁷ a. So, (a c a)^7 = a c⁷ a.\n\nTherefore, c⁴ = a c⁷ a. Multiply both sides by a on the left and right: a c⁴ a = a a c⁷ a a = e c⁷ e = c⁷. So, a c⁴ a = c⁷. But wait, this is similar to the original equation a b⁴ a = b⁷. So, c satisfies the same relation as b. Interesting. This might imply that c and b have similar properties, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a direct relation by manipulating exponents. Starting from a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's compute b⁷² = (b⁷)^10 * b² = (a b⁴ a)^10 * b². But this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute b⁷ in terms of b⁴ and a. Then, maybe express higher powers. For example, since a b⁴ a = b⁷, then b⁷ = a b⁴ a. Let's compute b⁴² = (b⁷)^6 = (a b⁴ a)^6 = a b⁴ (a a) b⁴ (a a) ... a = a b⁴ e b⁴ e ... a = a b²⁴ a. So, b⁴² = a b²⁴ a. Then, multiplying both sides by a on left and right: a b⁴² a = a a b²⁴ a a = b²⁴. So, a b⁴² a = b²⁴. But from the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷. So, perhaps we can find a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nFrom original: a b⁴ a = b⁷.\n\nThen, a b²⁴ a = b⁴².\n\nBut 24 is 6*4, and 42 is 6*7. So, each time we multiply the exponent by 6, the exponent on the right is multiplied by 6 as well. So, perhaps this pattern continues. Then, a b^(4*6^k) a = b^(7*6^k). Then, if we set 4*6^k = 42, but wait, 4*6^k=42 → 6^k=10.5, which is not an integer. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inductively find that a b^{4*7^k} a = b^{7^{k+1}} or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's notice that 7 and 4 are involved. Let's compute the exponents modulo something. For example, since we want to get to 33, maybe find exponents that sum up to 33.\n\nAlternatively, let's manipulate the original equation to express b in terms of a. Starting from a b⁴ a = b⁷, multiply both sides on the left by a: b⁴ a = a b⁷. Then, multiply both sides on the right by a: b⁴ = a b⁷ a. Now, substitute this expression for b⁴ back into itself. Let's see:\n\nb⁴ = a b⁷ a. Then, b⁷ = a b⁴ a = a (a b⁷ a) a = a² b⁷ a² = e b⁷ e = b⁷. So, that's just an identity. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, compute b⁷² in two ways. From the original relation, b⁷ = a b⁴ a. Then, b⁷² = (a b⁴ a)^72 = a b⁴ (a a) b⁴ ... a = a b^{4*72} a = a b^{288} a. But this seems too large and not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think modulo 33. If we can show that b³³ = e, then the order of b divides 33. So, perhaps find that b³³ can be expressed in terms of e through the given relations.\n\nLet's try to compute b³³ using the relation a b⁴ a = b⁷. Let's find exponents that can lead us to 33. Let's see:\n\nWe have b⁷ = a b⁴ a.\n\nLet's compute b¹¹. Not sure. Alternatively, let's compute b⁷ * b⁴ = b¹¹. But b⁷ = a b⁴ a, so b¹¹ = a b⁴ a * b⁴. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, express b⁴ in terms of a and b⁷. From the original equation, b⁴ = a b⁷ a. Then, substituting into b¹¹ = b⁷ * b⁴ = b⁷ * a b⁷ a. Which is b⁷ a b⁷ a. Maybe manipulate this.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute b⁷ a. From the original equation, a b⁴ a = b⁷, so b⁷ = a b⁴ a. Multiply both sides on the left by b⁻⁷: e = b⁻⁷ a b⁴ a. Then, rearrange: b⁻⁷ a b⁴ = a. Multiply both sides on the right by a: b⁻⁷ a b⁴ a = a² = e. So, b⁻⁷ a b⁴ a = e. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the following: since a² = e, then a = a⁻¹. So, the equation ab⁴a = b⁷ can be written as a b⁴ a⁻¹ = b⁷. This is the conjugation of b⁴ by a equals b⁷. So, (b⁴)^a = b⁷. Then, applying conjugation by a again, we get ((b⁴)^a)^a = (b⁷)^a. But conjugation is an isomorphism, so ((b⁴)^a)^a = b^(4*1) = b⁴, and (b⁷)^a = (b^a)^7. But we have that (b⁴)^a = b⁷, so (b^a)^4 = b⁷. Therefore, applying conjugation by a again gives (b^a)^4 = b⁷. But we also have that ((b^a)^4)^a = (b⁷)^a. But (b^a)^4 conjugated by a is b^(4*1) = b⁴, and (b⁷)^a = (b^a)^7. Therefore, b⁴ = (b^a)^7. But we already have (b^a)^4 = b⁷. So now we have two equations:\n\n1. (b^a)^4 = b⁷\n2. (b^a)^7 = b⁴\n\nLet's denote c = b^a. Then, the equations become:\n\n1. c⁴ = b⁷\n2. c⁷ = b⁴\n\nNow, we can substitute one into the other. From the first equation, b⁷ = c⁴. Substitute into the second equation: c⁷ = (c⁴)^{4/7} ??? Wait, no. Let's substitute b from the first equation into the second. From c⁴ = b⁷, we can write b = c^{4/7}, but since we are in group theory, exponents are integers modulo the order. This might not be straightforward. Alternatively, express b in terms of c.\n\nFrom c⁴ = b⁷, we can write b = c^{4 * 7⁻¹ mod m}, where m is the order of c. But without knowing m, this is not helpful. Alternatively, let's raise both equations to certain powers. From c⁴ = b⁷ and c⁷ = b⁴, substitute c⁴ from the first into the second: c⁷ = (c⁴)^{4/7}. Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, substitute c⁴ = b⁷ into the second equation: c⁷ = (c⁴)^{4} = c^{16}. Therefore, c⁷ = c^{16}, which implies c^{16-7} = c^9 = e. So, c^9 = e. But c = b^a, so (b^a)^9 = e. Since conjugation preserves order, (b^a)^9 = e implies b^9 = e. Wait, but that's only true if conjugation preserves exponents, which it does. So, if (b^a)^9 = e, then (b^9)^a = e, which implies b^9 = e^a⁻¹ = e. So, b^9 = e. Therefore, the order of b divides 9. But wait, but the problem wants to show that b^33 = e. If the order divides 9, then 9 divides 33? No, 9 and 33 are coprime except for 3. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, let's check this step again. We had c⁷ = c^{16}, so c^{9} = e. Therefore, the order of c divides 9. Since c is conjugate to b, their orders are the same. Therefore, the order of b divides 9. But this contradicts the conclusion we need to reach, which is that b^33 = e. Therefore, this suggests a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, let's backtrack. We had two equations:\n\n1. c⁴ = b⁷\n2. c⁷ = b⁴\n\nFrom 1, c⁴ = b⁷. From 2, c⁷ = b⁴. Let's substitute equation 1 into equation 2. From equation 1: b = c^{4/7}. Substitute into equation 2: c⁷ = (c^{4/7})⁴ = c^{16/7}. This is not straightforward in group theory since exponents must be integers. Therefore, perhaps this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, treat the exponents as integers and find a common multiple. Let's consider the two equations:\n\nc⁴ = b⁷ ...(1)\n\nc⁷ = b⁴ ...(2)\n\nFrom (1), substitute c⁴ into (2): c⁷ = (c⁴)^{1} * c³ = b⁷ * c³. But according to (2), c⁷ = b⁴. Therefore, b⁴ = b⁷ * c³. Rearranging, b⁻³ = c³. So, c³ = b⁻³.\n\nBut from (1), c⁴ = b⁷. Substitute c³ = b⁻³ into c⁴: c⁴ = c³ * c = b⁻³ * c. Therefore, b⁻³ * c = b⁷ ⇒ c = b¹⁰.\n\nBut c = b^a, which is a conjugate of b. So, b^a = b¹⁰. Therefore, conjugating b by a gives b¹⁰. Therefore, applying conjugation by a again: (b^a)^a = b^{10a}. But since conjugation by a twice is conjugation by a² = e, so (b^a)^a = b. Therefore, (b^{10})^a = b. But (b^{10})^a = (b^a)^{10} = (b^{10})^{10} = b^{100}. So, b^{100} = b. Therefore, b^{99} = e. So, the order of b divides 99. But 99 is 9*11. We need to show that the order divides 33. So, this suggests that the order divides 99. But how do we get down to 33?\n\nWait, but we also have from earlier that the order of b must divide 9, which conflicts with dividing 99. There's inconsistency here, which means I must have made a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nLet me check again. From c⁴ = b⁷ and c⁷ = b⁴. If we substitute c = b^a, then:\n\nFrom c⁴ = b⁷ ⇒ (b^a)^4 = b⁷.\n\nFrom c⁷ = b⁴ ⇒ (b^a)^7 = b⁴.\n\nLet's write these as:\n\nb^{4a} = b⁷ ...(1)\n\nb^{7a} = b⁴ ...(2)\n\nWhere b^{ka} denotes the conjugation of b^k by a, i.e., a b^k a⁻¹ = a b^k a.\n\nBut since conjugation by a is an automorphism, we have that (b^k)^a = (b^a)^k. Therefore, equation (1) becomes (b^a)^4 = b⁷, and equation (2) becomes (b^a)^7 = b⁴.\n\nLet me denote d = b^a. Then, equations become:\n\nd⁴ = b⁷ ...(1)\n\nd⁷ = b⁴ ...(2)\n\nNow, substitute d⁴ from (1) into (2):\n\nd⁷ = d⁴ * d³ = b⁷ * d³. But from (2), d⁷ = b⁴. Therefore:\n\nb⁴ = b⁷ * d³ ⇒ b⁻³ = d³ ⇒ d³ = b⁻³ ...(3)\n\nFrom (1), d⁴ = b⁷. Let's express d⁴ as d³ * d = b⁻³ * d (from (3)). Therefore:\n\nb⁻³ * d = b⁷ ⇒ d = b⁷ * b³ = b^{10} ⇒ d = b^{10}.\n\nBut d = b^a, so b^a = b^{10}. Therefore, conjugating b by a gives b^{10}. Now, let's conjugate both sides by a again:\n\n(b^a)^a = (b^{10})^a ⇒ b^{a²} = b^{10a}.\n\nBut a² = e, so the left side is b^{e} = b. The right side is (b^{10})^a = (b^a)^{10} = (b^{10})^{10} = b^{100}. Therefore, we have:\n\nb = b^{100} ⇒ b^{99} = e.\n\nTherefore, the order of b divides 99. So, b^{99} = e. But we need to show that b^{33} = e. Since 33 divides 99 (99 = 3*33), then b^{33} = e^(3) = e. Therefore, b^{33} = e. Hence, proved.\n\nAh! So, this is the key step. By showing that the order of b divides 99, we can conclude that b^{33} = e since 33 is a divisor of 99. Therefore, the problem is solved.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. From the given relation ab⁴a = b⁷, we conjugate to get d = b^a = a b a.\n\n2. We derive that d⁴ = b⁷ and d⁷ = b⁴.\n\n3. Solving these, we find that d³ = b⁻³ and d = b^{10}.\n\n4. Conjugating again leads to b = b^{100}, hence b^{99} = e.\n\n5. Therefore, the order of b divides 99, so b^{33} = e.\n\nThis completes the proof.",
