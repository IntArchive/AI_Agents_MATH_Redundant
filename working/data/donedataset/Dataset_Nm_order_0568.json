    "Content": "I wish to extend the factorial to non-integer arguments in a unique way, given the following conditions: $n!=n(n-1)!$ $1!=1$ To anyone interested in viewing the final form before reading the whole post: $$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ $$f(x):=\\ln(x!)$$ $$f(x)=\\ln(x!)=\\ln(x)+\\ln((x-1)!)=\\ln(x)+f(x-1)$$ $$f(x)=f(x-1)+\\ln(x)$$ $$\\frac d{dx}f(x)=\\frac d{dx}f(x-1)+\\ln(x)$$ $$f'(x)=f'(x-1)+\\frac1x\\tag1$$ $$f'(x)=f'(x-2)+\\frac1{x-1}+\\frac1x$$ $$=f'(0)+1+\\frac12+\\frac13+\\dots+\\frac1x$$ for $x\\in\\mathbb N$ : $$f'(x)=f'(0)+\\sum_{n=1}^x\\frac1n\\tag2$$ Euler has a nice extension of the harmonic numbers to non-integer arguments, $$f'(x)=f'(0)+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^x}{1-t}dt\\tag{2.1}$$ from the FTOC we have $$\\ln(x!)=\\int_0^x\\left(f'(0)+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi$$ $$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(f'(0)+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]\\tag3$$ And with $f'(0)=-\\gamma$ , the Euler mascheroni constant, we should get the gamma function.  Or we may just let it sit as an unknown parameter. My questions are if this captures all possible extensions of the factorial with the given conditions, since, if it did, it'd be a pretty good general extension to the factorial? Given a few more assumptions, it is easy enough to set bounds to what $f'(0)$ might be as well. Notably, this representation fails when considering $\\Re(x)\\le-1$ , but coupled with the first condition, it is extendable to all $x$ , except of course the negative integers. robjohn♦ notes an extension to the harmonic numbers that converges for $x\\in\\mathbb C$ , except the negative integers: $$\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac1n-\\frac1{n+\\phi}\\right)$$ Any suggestions on things I could've improved and flaws in this would be nice. Edit: Using the second condition and $x=1$ , we may have $$1=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^1\\left(f'(0)+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ $$\\implies f'(0)=-\\int_0^1\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\ d\\phi$$ $$f'(0)=-\\gamma$$ where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-mascheroni constant. Using this we get a new form of the gamma function(?): $$\\boxed{x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]}\\tag4$$ $$=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(\\frac1n-\\frac1{n+\\phi}\\right)\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ I'm not sure how to deal with trivial manipulations of this expression, as surely someone is gonna say \"hey, just multiply everything by $(1+\\sin(2\\pi x))$ and it will still satisfy the conditions, right?\" But regardless, I think this is a pretty cool new gamma function? Also, references to this if it's not new. If someone could make a graph of this to look at, you would be great.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about extending the factorial to non-integer arguments with two conditions: n! = n*(n-1)! and 1! = 1. They derived an expression involving integrals and the Euler-Mascheroni constant, ending up with a new form for x! and asking if this captures all possible extensions under the given conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states two main conditions for extending the factorial: the recursive formula and the base case. The user also mentions that the extension should be unique given these conditions. Additionally, they set f'(0) = -γ, which comes from the Euler-Mascheroni constant. However, in the assumptions, we should only include the conditions given, not the derived results. So the key assumptions are the two factorial conditions and the extension to non-integer arguments. The mention of f'(0) = -γ is part of their derivation but might not be an initial assumption. Wait, in the problem statement, the user starts with the two conditions and then derives the form. The problem is whether this form is the unique extension under those conditions. So the assumptions are the two factorial conditions. Also, they want the extension to non-integer arguments. The original problem's title is about deriving a new form of the gamma function, so the problem is whether their derived formula is a valid extension under those conditions. The user also mentions that the representation fails for Re(x) ≤ -1 but is extendable except for negative integers. However, the main problem is to check if their extension is valid given the conditions. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The factorial extension satisfies n! = n*(n-1)! for all non-integer arguments (wait, actually, the original conditions are for extending factorial to non-integer arguments, but the conditions given are n! = n*(n-1)! and 1! = 1. So the first condition is the recursive relation, applied to all x (since it's extended), and the second is the base case. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function x! satisfies x! = x*(x-1)! for all x (except maybe negative integers).\n- The function satisfies 1! = 1.\n- The extension is to non-integer arguments.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as one line per object? Let's see. Each assumption addresses one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption 1: The function x! is defined for non-integer arguments x.\n\nAssumption 2: The function x! satisfies the recursive relation x! = x \\cdot (x - 1)!.\n\nAssumption 3: The function x! satisfies 1! = 1.\n\nThe problem then is whether their derived form captures all possible extensions under these conditions. The user's main question is: \"if this captures all possible extensions of the factorial with the given conditions\" and \"references to this if it's not new.\"\n\nSo the Problem part would be: Determine if the derived expression for x! captures all possible extensions of the factorial function satisfying the given conditions.\n\nWait, but the user also presents their derived form and asks if it's a new form of the gamma function. But according to the example, the problem section is the actual problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the user is asking if their derived form captures all possible extensions given the conditions, which is the problem. So the problem is: \"Does the derived expression for x! capture all possible extensions of the factorial function under the given conditions?\" Alternatively, as phrased in the question: \"My questions are if this captures all possible extensions of the factorial with the given conditions...\" So the problem is asking whether the derived form is the unique extension under those conditions.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The factorial function is extended to non-integer arguments.\n- The extended factorial satisfies the recursive relation x! = x \\cdot (x - 1)! for all x (except negative integers).\n- The extended factorial satisfies 1! = 1.\n\nProblem: Determine if the expression\n$$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$\ncaptures all possible extensions of the factorial function under the given conditions.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions that they derived this form assuming the conditions. The problem is to check if this is the unique solution. Also, the user mentions \"if this captures all possible extensions...\", which is the problem. So the problem is to determine whether this expression uniquely satisfies the given conditions, hence capturing all possible extensions. Alternatively, to prove that under the given conditions, the factorial extension must take this form. So the problem is: Prove that the given expression is the unique extension of the factorial function satisfying the specified conditions.\n\nBut the user asks \"if this captures all possible extensions\", which is a yes/no question, but in the format, it's better to present it as a problem statement. The user also mentions in the title \"Did I derive a new form of the gamma function?\" So possibly the problem is to verify if their derived expression is equivalent to the gamma function or a new valid form under the conditions.\n\nBut given the example, the problem should be a statement to be proven or addressed, not a question. The example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nIn this case, the user's main question is whether their derived form captures all possible extensions given the conditions. So the problem statement would be: \"Determine whether the expression for x! uniquely satisfies the given conditions, thereby capturing all possible extensions of the factorial function.\"\n\nAlternatively, phrased as: \"Prove that the expression $$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ is the unique extension of the factorial function satisfying the conditions x! = x \\cdot (x - 1)! and 1! = 1.\"\n\nBut the user's problem is to check if this is the case. So maybe the problem is to verify the uniqueness of the extension under the given conditions, i.e., to determine if the given expression is the only such extension.\n\nSo combining everything, the assumptions are the conditions given (recursion, 1! =1, extension to non-integers), and the problem is to prove whether the derived expression is the unique such extension.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe factorial function is extended to non-integer arguments,\nThe extended factorial function satisfies $x! = x \\cdot (x - 1)!$,\nThe extended factorial function satisfies $1! = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the expression $$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ is the unique extension of the factorial function satisfying the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the user is asking if their derivation is correct and if this captures all possible extensions, so the problem could be phrased as proving that the given expression satisfies the conditions and is unique.\n\nBut based on the example, the problem part is the problem statement. The user's question is: \"if this captures all possible extensions of the factorial with the given conditions\" and if this is a new form of the gamma function. But since the example's problem was a statement to prove, perhaps we need to rephrase the user's question into a problem statement. However, the user's main problem is presented as \"Did I derive a new form of the gamma function?\" and asking if their expression captures all possible extensions.\n\nBut according to the example, the original problem was rephrased to extract the core problem. The example had an original problem with some text, and the formatted version extracted the assumptions and problem.\n\nIn this case, the user's original problem is to check if their derived expression is a valid and unique extension of the factorial under the given conditions, and whether it's a new form of the gamma function.\n\nBut to fit into the format, which requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections, we need to list the assumptions (the conditions given for the factorial extension) and the problem (whether the derived expression is the unique such extension or equivalent to gamma function).\n\nHowever, the user's derived expression is presented, and the problem is to verify if it's correct under those assumptions. So the problem is: Prove that the given expression for x! satisfies the factorial conditions and is unique.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are the three conditions: extension to non-integer, recursion, and 1! =1.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe factorial function is extended to non-integer arguments,\nThe extended factorial satisfies $x! = x \\cdot (x - 1)!$ for all non-integer x,\nThe extended factorial satisfies $1! = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the expression $$x!=\\exp\\left[\\int_0^x\\left(-\\gamma+\\int_0^1\\frac{1-t^\\phi}{1-t}dt\\right)d\\phi\\right]$$ is the unique extension of the factorial function under the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to determine if it's a new form of the gamma function, but the user's main question is about uniqueness given the conditions. The gamma function is known to be the unique extension under certain conditions (Bohr-Mollerup theorem), so perhaps the problem is to show whether their expression is equivalent to the gamma function or a new form.\n\nBut the user mentions they set f'(0) = -γ and ended up with what they think is the gamma function. So maybe the problem is to confirm if their derived expression is indeed the gamma function.\n\nBut the question is titled \"Did I derive a new form of the gamma function?\" So the problem is to determine whether the given expression is a new form of the gamma function or equivalent.\n\nHowever, given the format example, which took the original problem's core and structured it, perhaps the problem here is to prove that the given expression satisfies the factorial conditions and is unique, which would relate to the Bohr-Mollerup theorem.\n\nBut since the user's main question is whether their expression captures all possible extensions (i.e., uniqueness) and if it's a new form of gamma, the problem statement would need to capture that.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem section is the actual problem statement. So the user's problem is whether their derived formula is the unique extension under the given conditions, hence the problem is: \"Prove that the expression [...] is the unique extension of the factorial function satisfying the given conditions.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to determine if the expression is equivalent to the gamma function, but since the user says \"with the given conditions, it'd be a pretty good general extension\", maybe the problem is to establish the uniqueness.\n\nIn conclusion, the assumptions are the three conditions, and the problem is to prove that the given expression is the unique extension.",
