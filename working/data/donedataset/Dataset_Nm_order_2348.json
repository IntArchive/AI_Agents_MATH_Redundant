    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can see that $$f(x)=\\frac{\\ln x}{x}$$ is strictly increasing in $(0,e)$ and striclty decreasing in $(e,+\\infty)$ . Thus the equality $f(x)=f(y)$ cannot hold for the case of $x,y \\in (0,e)$ or $x,y \\in (0,+\\infty)$ . Since $x\\lt y$ , it follows that $x\\in (0,e)$ and $y \\in (e,+\\infty)$ . So let $y=rx$ , for $r\\in (1,+\\infty)$ and we obtain $$(xr)^x = (x)^{rx}\\implies rx \\ln x = x (\\ln r + \\ln x)\\implies(r−1)\\ln x = \\ln r$$ So, $$x = r^{1/(r−1)}, y= r^{r/(r−1)}$$ and we need to show that for $r\\in (1,+\\infty)$ , the function $$g(r)=r^{1/(r−1)}+r^{r/(r−1)}\\gt2e$$ We notice that $$\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1}r^{1/(r−1)}=\\lim_{r\\rightarrow1}r^{r/(r−1)}=e$$ Indeed, if we set $u=\\frac1r$ we get $\\lim(1+\\frac1u)^u=e$ , and similarly for the second limit. Thus we only need to show that $g(r)$ is strictly increasing in $(1,+\\infty)$ . EDIT (As clark rightly pointed, the first approach to prove that $g(r)$ is strictly increasing was wrong on my part-see the comments below. I hope this new take is correct.) We wish to show that $g(r)=r^{\\frac{1}{r-1}}(r+1)$ is strictly increasing. We will show that $h(r)=\\ln g(r)$ is strictly increasing and since $\\ln x$ is s.i, we derive from this the fact that $g(r)$ is s.i. (That is, if $h(x)=\\ln g(x)$ is strictly increasing $\\Rightarrow g(x)$ is strictly increasing. To show this one can simply use Reductio ad absurdum and assume $h(x)$ is s.i while $g(x)$ is not s.i. ) So, we have $$\\ln g(r)=\\ln r^{\\frac{1}{r-1}}(r+1)=\\ln r^{\\frac{1}{r-1}}+\\ln(r+1)=\\frac1{r-1}\\ln r+\\ln (r+1)\\\\h'(r)=\\ln r+\\frac{1}{r(r-1)}+\\frac1{r+1}\\gt0, \\forall r \\in (1,+\\infty)$$ It follows that $h(r)$ is strictly increasing and so is $g(r)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to their specified format. Let me look at the example they provided to make sure I understand the requirements.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version lists each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition of one object. Then the problem statement is given. \n\nNow, looking at the problem here: The title is \"if $x^y = y^x$ show that $x + y > 2e$\". The question body starts with the conditions $0 < x < y$ and $x^y = y^x$. The user then mentions some steps they took, like manipulating the equation to involve natural logarithms and defining a function $f(x) = \\frac{\\ln x}{x}$ with its derivative. They also mention considering $x$ and $y$ around the value $e$, maybe trying to use some inequality related to $x - e$ and $y - e$.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states $0 < x < y$ and $x^y = y^x$. These are two separate conditions. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. $0 < x < y$ (this is a single condition comparing x and y)\n2. $x^y = y^x$ (another condition relating x and y)\n\nBut wait, the example had each assumption as a single property or condition applied to one object. Here, the first assumption is about both x and y (0 < x < y). However, the example's first assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", which is a single property of n. Then the second assumption was \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", another single property. But in the problem here, the first condition is a relation between x and y. How should this be handled?\n\nLooking back at the example, the user structured the assumptions as two separate lines even though they both applied to the same object (n). In this case, the relation between x and y (0 < x < y) is a single condition, so maybe it should be one line. Then the equation x^y = y^x is another condition. So total two assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement is to show that x + y > 2e. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- $0 < x < y$,\n- $x^y = y^x$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $x + y > 2e$.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user had the assumption that n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption was a separate line. So maybe here, even though 0 < x < y is a single line, it's a condition on both x and y. But according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Hmm, maybe split it into:\n\n- x and y are positive real numbers,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut the original problem says \"0 < x < y\", which combines three inequalities: x > 0, x < y, and y > 0 (implicitly). But since the example combined two conditions into one line when they were part of the same inequality (like 0 < x < e), maybe the correct approach is to list each separate inequality as a different assumption. But in the example, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. However, in the original problem here, the user wrote \"0 < x < y\", which is a combined inequality. To follow the example's structure, perhaps split into:\n\n- x is a positive real number,\n- y is a positive real number,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut the original problem statement didn't explicitly state that x and y are positive, but given the context (since they're raising to real powers and logarithms are involved), we can assume x and y are positive. However, in the problem as presented, the user wrote \"0 < x < y\", so that's a single condition. Maybe the correct way is to list each individual component as separate assumptions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which was written as \"n is an integer\". Then there was another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate condition. But in the problem here, \"0 < x < y\" is a single condition, but it could be broken down into:\n\n- x > 0,\n- y > 0,\n- x < y.\n\nBut the user's example didn't split combined inequalities. For instance, if the problem had \"0 < x < e\", would they split into two assumptions? Probably not. Let me check the example again. The original example had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps each bullet point is a single mathematical statement, even if it combines multiple inequalities.\n\nTherefore, \"0 < x < y\" is a single assumption. Then \"x^y = y^x\" is another. So two assumptions.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Here, \"0 < x < y\" involves two variables. So maybe this is conflicting. But in the absence of further examples, I think the original problem's assumptions should be taken as written. The user wrote \"0 < x < y\", so that's one assumption. Then \"x^y = y^x\" is the second. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $0 < x < y$,\n- $x^y = y^x$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $x + y > 2e$.\n\nBut let me check the user's own example. In their example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption is n is an integer, and then the user added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's different. Wait, in the original problem, the user's formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. Wait, original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems like the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem is for every integer n, so n is an integer is the assumption. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. Unless the original problem had a typo and actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user here might have mistyped. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the user intended to show that the problem requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original statement was different. This might be a mistake in the example. But regardless, perhaps the user wants us to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they are not all explicitly stated. But this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the original example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut 91 is 7*13. So if n is divisible by 7, then maybe the expression is divisible by 7 and 13? But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the user added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect. Or maybe the original problem had a different condition. This is confusing.\n\nBut regardless, the instruction for me is to structure the given problem according to the format, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote \"Let 0 < x < y, such that x^y = y^x. Show that x + y > 2e.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. 0 < x < y (this is a single condition involving both x and y)\n2. x^y = y^x (a relation between x and y)\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. However, in this case, the first assumption involves two variables. Maybe the user expects us to split it into separate conditions:\n\n- x is a positive real number,\n- y is a positive real number,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut the original problem states \"0 < x < y\", which implies x and y are positive and x < y. So perhaps we need to split into three assumptions:\n\n1. x is a positive real number,\n2. y is a positive real number,\n3. x is less than y,\n4. x^y = y^x.\n\nBut that might be over-splitting. The instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" Here, \"0 < x < y\" applies to both x and y, but maybe each inequality can be considered a separate assumption. However, \"0 < x\" is a property of x, \"x < y\" is a relation between x and y, and \"y > 0\" is a property of y. But the original problem states \"0 < x < y\", which implies all three. So perhaps:\n\n- x and y are positive real numbers,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut then \"x and y are positive real numbers\" is a single assumption about both x and y. The instruction says \"applied to one object\". So maybe each assumption should be about one object. Therefore:\n\n- x is a positive real number,\n- y is a positive real number,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nThis way, each assumption is about one object (x or y) or a relation between them. But the example given by the user didn't split \"0 < x < y\" into separate assumptions. But since the example might have been incorrectly formatted, perhaps it's safer to follow the problem's original wording and structure the assumptions as given.\n\nThe problem states \"0 < x < y\", so that's one assumption. Then \"x^y = y^x\" is another. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- $0 < x < y$,\n- $x^y = y^x$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $x + y > 2e$.\n\nBut the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. However, the first assumption here is a compound condition involving two variables. Maybe the intended way is to list each variable's condition separately. For example:\n\n- x is a positive real number,\n- y is a positive real number,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut this way, each is a single condition about one object or a relation. The problem is that in the original problem, \"0 < x < y\" is a single statement. But according to the example, maybe splitting is not required. However, given the user's example, perhaps they consider each separate inequality as a separate assumption, even if they are part of a combined statement. But in the example, the user took \"for every integer n\" as \"n is an integer\" and then added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not have been in the original problem. So maybe there's inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a mistake, and the user actually wants us to list all given conditions as separate assumptions, even if they are combined in the original problem. Given that, in the current problem, \"0 < x < y\" is given, which combines three conditions: x > 0, y > 0, x < y. So splitting into:\n\n- x > 0,\n- y > 0,\n- x < y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nBut according to the instructions, each assumption should apply to one object. So x > 0 applies to x, y > 0 applies to y, x < y applies to both. But x < y is a relation between two objects. The example didn't have such a case. The example had assumptions about a single object each. But in this problem, we have relations. So maybe the user expects relations to be separate assumptions. Therefore, \"x < y\" is a separate assumption, and \"x > 0\", \"y > 0\" are separate. So four assumptions total.\n\nBut the original problem didn't explicitly state x and y are positive; it's implied by 0 < x < y. So if we split, we have:\n\nAssumption:\n- x is a positive real number,\n- y is a positive real number,\n- x is less than y,\n- x^y = y^x.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $x + y > 2e$.\n\nThis seems more aligned with the instruction's requirement of each assumption addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Even though \"x < y\" is a relation, it's a single condition, so it's listed as a separate assumption. Therefore, this would be the correct formatting.",
