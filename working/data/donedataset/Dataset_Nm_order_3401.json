    "Content": "Let $G$ be the group  of all $2 \\times 2$ matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d\\end{pmatrix}$ where $ad \\neq 0$ under matrix multiplication. Let  $N=\\left\\{A \\in G \\; \\colon \\; A = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\right\\}$ be  a subset  of the group $G$. Prove that  $N$ is  a normal subgroup of $G$ and prove that  $G/N$ is abelian group. Here is my attempt! To prove $N$ is normal I consider  the group homomorphism $f \\colon G \\to \\mathbb R^*$ given by $f(B) = \\det(B)$ for all $B$ in $G$. And I see that $f(N)$ is all the singleton $\\{1\\}$ since $\\{1\\}$ as a subgroup of $\\mathbb R^*$  is normal, it follows that $N$ is also normal. Is this proof helpful  here? Then how to prove that $G/N$ is Abelian? I know $G/N$ is a collection of left cosets. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One way is using first isomorphism theorem . To do this you should find a group homomorphism such that $\\operatorname{Ker} \\varphi=N$. Let us try $\\varphi: G\\to \\mathbb R^*\\times \\mathbb R^*$ given by\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d\\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto (a,d).$$\n(By $\\mathbb R^*$ I denote the group $\\mathbb R^*=\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{0\\}$ with multiplication. By $G\\times H$ I denote the direct product of two groups, maybe your book uses notation $G\\oplus H$ for this.) It is relatively easy to verify that $\\varphi$ is a surjective homomorphism. It is clear that $\\operatorname{Ker} \\varphi=N$. Hence, by the first isomorphism theorem,\n$$G/N \\cong \\mathbb R^*\\times\\mathbb R^*$$\nThis is a commutative group. If you prefer, for any reason, not using the first isomorphism theorem, you could also try to verify one of equivalent definitions of normal subgroup and then describe the cosets and their multiplication. In this case you have\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b' \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\frac1{ad}\n\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix}=\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\frac{ab'}d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ \n(I have omitted the computations), which shows that $xNx^{-1}\\subseteq N$ for any $x\\in G$. You can find out easily that cosets are the sets of the form\n$$\\{\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}; y\\in\\mathbb R\\}$$ \nfor $x,z\\in\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{0\\}$ and that the multiplication of cosets representatives $\\begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\\ 0 & z \\end{pmatrix}$ is coordinate-wise.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I structure the problem correctly based on the given example.\n\nFirst, the original problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving that a certain subgroup N is normal in G and that the quotient group G/N is abelian. The user also provided their attempt using a determinant homomorphism. My task is to filter out any unrelated information and structure the problem according to the specified format.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the group G consists of 2x2 matrices of a specific form, and N is a subset of G. The goal is to prove two things: N is a normal subgroup of G, and G/N is abelian.\n\nFirst, let's list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\n1. G is a group under matrix multiplication.\n2. All elements of G are 2x2 matrices of the form [[a, b], [0, d]] where ad ≠ 0.\n3. N is a subset of G.\n4. Every element of N is a matrix of the form [[1, b], [0, 1]].\n\nThese are the key points from the problem statement. The user's attempt mentions using a determinant homomorphism from G to R^*, but the problem itself doesn't mention the determinant unless the user's approach is part of the problem. However, since the task is to structure the problem as given, not the user's attempt, I should exclude their method. The problem states that N is defined as those matrices in G with 1s on the diagonal and 0 in the bottom left, and arbitrary top right entry b. So the assumptions are about the structure of G and N.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Let N be a subset of G where A is in N if A is of that specific form.\" So N is defined by those matrices. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is the group of 2x2 matrices [[a, b],[0, d]] with ad ≠ 0 under multiplication.\n- N is the set of matrices in G of the form [[1, b],[0, 1]].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is one line, one property. So maybe split into:\n\n- G is a group under matrix multiplication.\n- Every element of G is a 2x2 matrix of the form [[a, b], [0, d]] where ad ≠ 0.\n- N is a subset of G.\n- Every element of N is a 2x2 matrix of the form [[1, b], [0, 1]].\n\nBut wait, ad ≠ 0 is part of the definition of G, so that's an assumption. Then N is a subset with specific structure. So that's four assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove two things: N is normal in G, and G/N is abelian. The original problem statement includes both parts. So the problem line should state both.\n\nBut the example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is \"Prove that N is a normal subgroup of G and that G/N is an abelian group.\"\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- G is a group under matrix multiplication.\n- Every element of G is a 2×2 matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}$ where $ad \\neq 0$.\n- N is a subset of G.\n- Every element of N is a 2×2 matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that N is a normal subgroup of G and that G/N is an abelian group.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one line, one property. The second assumption combines two things: the structure of the matrices and the condition ad ≠ 0. But in the example, they combined \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. Wait, in the example, the original problem was that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the user structured it with two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the user added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be correct. Maybe the example had an error, but I need to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the key is that the assumptions should be split into individual lines. So if the original problem says G is a group of matrices of a certain form under multiplication, then the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group under matrix multiplication.\n- Every element of G is a 2×2 matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}$ where $ad \\neq 0$.\n- N is a subset of G.\n- Every element of N is a 2×2 matrix of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThese are four separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the two things. So that's the structure.",
