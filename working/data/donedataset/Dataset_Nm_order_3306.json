    "Content": "Let $\\alpha:=\\sqrt[3]{17}$ and $K:=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ . We know that $$\\mathcal{O}_K=\\left\\{\\frac{a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2}{3}:a\\equiv c\\equiv -b\\pmod{3}\\right\\}.$$ I have to show that $K$ has class number $1$ , i.e. $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a PID. The Minkowski bound $\\lambda <9$ , so we should consider the primes $2, 3, 5, 7$ . It's easy to show that $2\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}_1\\mathfrak{p}_2$ , with $\\mathfrak{p}_1=(2, \\alpha+1)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_2=(2, \\alpha^2+\\alpha+1)$ $3\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}_3^2\\mathfrak{p}_4$ (I can't compute these primes explicitly) $5\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}_5\\mathfrak{p}_6$ , with $\\mathfrak{p}_5=(5, \\alpha+2)$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_6=(5, \\alpha^2+3\\alpha-1)$ $7\\mathcal{O}_K=\\mathfrak{p}_7$ Now, how can I show that, for example, $\\mathfrak{p}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_5$ are principal ideals? (I can't find elements with norm $2$ or $5$ ). The situation for the prime $3$ is more complicated: the book suggests to find elements in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with norm $3$ that are coprime (this implies that $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_4$ are principal), but I can't find these elements. Note that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\alpha+c\\alpha^2)=a^3+17b^3+17^2c^3-3\\cdot 17 abc$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first thing to do is get a clean basis without annoying congruence\nconditions : put $\\beta=\\frac{\\alpha^2-\\alpha+1}{3}$. Then\n$[1,\\alpha,\\beta]$ is a $\\mathbb Z$-basis of $\\mathcal{O}_K$. We apply Franz Lemmermeyer's method and look for elements of the\nform $x+y\\alpha+z\\beta$ with interesting norms and $x,y,z$ small.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is about showing that Q(³√17) has class number 1. The user mentions that the ring of integers O_K has a specific form and they need to prove O_K is a PID. The Minkowski bound is less than 9, so primes to consider are 2, 3, 5, 7. They've factored the ideals generated by these primes in O_K but are stuck on showing certain ideals are principal, like p1 and p5, and dealing with the prime 3's factorization. They also mention the norm formula for elements in O_K.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the problem:\n\n- K is Q(α) where α = ³√17.\n- The ring of integers O_K is given by the set { (a + bα + cα²)/3 | a ≡ -b mod 3, c ≡ -b mod 3 }.\n- The goal is to show O_K has class number 1, i.e., O_K is a PID.\n- Minkowski bound λ < 9, so primes to consider are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n- Factoring of 2O_K, 3O_K, 5O_K, and 7O_K into prime ideals.\n- Specific generators for some prime ideals: p1=(2, α+1), p2=(2, α²+α+1), p5=(5, α+2), p6=(5, α²+3α-1), and p7=7O_K.\n- The user is struggling to show p1 and p5 are principal (can't find elements with norm 2 or 5).\n- For prime 3, the ideal factors as p3²p4, but can't compute explicitly. The book suggests finding elements in O_K with norm 3 that are coprime to show p3 and p4 are principal.\n- The norm formula N(a + bα + cα²) = a³ + 17b³ + 17²c³ - 3*17abc.\n\nSo the assumptions are each individual conditions or given facts. Let me list them:\n\n1. Let α = ³√17.\n2. Let K = Q(α).\n3. The ring of integers O_K is { (a + bα + cα²)/3 | a ≡ -b mod 3 and c ≡ -b mod 3 }.\n4. The Minkowski bound for K is λ < 9.\n5. Prime ideals to consider are those above 2, 3, 5, 7.\n6. 2O_K factors as p1 * p2 where p1 = (2, α + 1) and p2 = (2, α² + α + 1).\n7. 3O_K factors as p3² * p4.\n8. 5O_K factors as p5 * p6 where p5 = (5, α + 2) and p6 = (5, α² + 3α -1).\n9. 7O_K is a prime ideal p7.\n10. The norm N(a + bα + cα²) = a³ + 17b³ + 17²c³ - 3*17abc.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that K has class number 1, i.e., O_K is a PID. However, in the example given, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the problem is to show O_K has class number 1, with the listed assumptions. The user's specific issues are about proving certain ideals are principal, which is part of showing the class number is 1. But according to the example, the problem statement is the main goal, and the assumptions include all the given conditions. So the problem here is \"Show that K has class number 1, i.e., O_K is a PID,\" and the assumptions are each of the given conditions like the ring of integers structure, Minkowski bound, prime ideal factorizations, and norm formula.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. Let me check again:\n\n1. α is the cube root of 17.\n2. K is the field Q(α).\n3. The ring of integers O_K is { (a + bα + cα²)/3 | a ≡ -b mod 3, c ≡ -b mod 3 }.\n4. The Minkowski bound for K is less than 9.\n5. Primes to consider for class number computation are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n6. 2O_K factors into prime ideals p1 and p2 with given generators.\n7. 3O_K factors into p3² * p4.\n8. 5O_K factors into p5 and p6 with given generators.\n9. 7O_K is a prime ideal p7.\n10. The norm of an element a + bα + cα² is given by the formula N(...).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show class number 1. So that's the formatted problem.",
