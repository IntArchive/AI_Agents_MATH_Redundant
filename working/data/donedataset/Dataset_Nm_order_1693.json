    "Content": "Right now, I'm taking a basic introductory analysis course.   I came across this on wikipedia and I'm Really struggling to prove it is a metric space. (Need help with the 3rd axiom of metric space the most and making the 2nd one more rigorous/less handwaving) The set of all $m$ by $b$ matrices over some field is a metric space with respect to the rank distance $d(X,Y)=\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X) $ Facts that I know:\nSo I know that in order to prove something is a metric space $d(X,Y)=0$ iff $X=Y$   (have to prove both ways) $d(X,Y)=d(Y,X)$  (Symmetry) $d(X,Y)\\leqslant d(X,Z) +d(Z,Y)$ (Triangle inequality). Also, it has been a long time since I have taken linear algebra\", but I now that to find the rank, you reduce a matrix to its row echelon form and the number of nonzero rows is the rank (or I think number of linearly independent rows, again it has been awhile). My attempt: If $Y=X$, We have $\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)=\\operatorname{rank}(Y-Y)=\\operatorname{rank}(O)$ (where $O$ is the null matrix) which is clearly equal to $0$.  Thus $d(X,Y)=0$.  Proving other direction if $d(X,Y)=0$, we have $\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)=0$.  In this case $Y$ must necessarily equal $X$.  If $Y$ does not equal $X$, rank must be at least $1$. Why must $d(X,Y)=d(Y,X)$?  The matrix $X-Y$ and $Y-X$ only differ by signs.  That doesn't change rank.  Hence $\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)=\\operatorname{rank}(X-Y)$.  (feel like I hand waved this explanation a bit). Why must $d(X,Y)\\leqslant d(X,Z)+ d(Z,Y)$? Need to show: $$\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)\\leqslant\\operatorname{rank}(Z-X)+ \\operatorname{rank}(Y-Z)$$where $X,Y,Z$ are $m \\times n$ matrices. This one I'm not sure at all how to approach this.  Why must $\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)\\leqslant \\operatorname{rank}(Z-X)+\\operatorname{rank}(Y-Z)$?  I'm not sure why this must be the case and how to formally show this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your answers for the first and second points are correct. The second is not hand-wavy by any means, you have said the crucial thing, namely that $X-Y$ is a scalar multiple of $Y-X$ , so their rank is the same. As for the third one, if $Z - X = a$ and $Y - Z = b$ , then you essentially have to prove that $\\operatorname{rank}(a+b) \\leq \\operatorname{rank}(a) + \\operatorname{rank}(b)$ . However, note that if some set of vectors span the columns of $a$ , and another set of vectors span the columns of $b$ , then the union of these vectors spans the columns of $a+b$ . From here, I urge you to use the definition of rank to understand why this statement follows. EDIT : Suppose that $\\{e_i\\}$ span the columns of $a$ , and $\\{f_j\\}$ span the columns of $b$ . My claim is that $\\{e_i\\} \\cup \\{f_j\\}$ span the columns of $a+b$ . It's easy to see why. Suppose $A$ is a column of $a+b$ , then we know that $A= A_a + A_b$ , where $A_a$ and $A_b$ are the corresponding columns of $a$ and $b$ which were added to give the column $A$ of $a+b$ . Now, $A_a$ is spanned by the $\\{e_i\\}$ , so there exist constants $c_i$ such that $A_a = \\sum_{i} c_ie_i$ . Simiarly, since $A_b$ is spanned by $\\{f_j\\}$ , we get that $A_b = \\sum_j d_jf_j$ for some constants $d_j$ . Adding these two, gives that $A = \\sum_i c_ie_i + \\sum_j {d_jf_j}$ . Hence, you can see that $A$ is spanned by $\\{e_i\\} \\cup \\{f_j\\}$ . Hence, the rank of $A$ is less than the size of $\\{e_i\\} \\cup \\{f_j\\}$ , which is less than $\\operatorname{rank} a + \\operatorname{rank} b$ . Hence, the inequality follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants to prove that the set of all m×n matrices over a field forms a metric space with the rank distance defined as d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X). They mentioned they need help especially with the triangle inequality part. \n\nFirst, let me recall the axioms of a metric space. A metric d on a set S must satisfy four conditions:\n1. Non-negativity: d(X,Y) ≥ 0 for all X, Y in S.\n2. Identity of indiscernibles: d(X,Y) = 0 if and only if X = Y.\n3. Symmetry: d(X,Y) = d(Y,X) for all X, Y in S.\n4. Triangle inequality: d(X,Y) ≤ d(X,Z) + d(Z,Y) for all X, Y, Z in S.\n\nThe user is struggling with the third and fourth axioms. Let's break them down.\n\nStarting with the first part: proving d(X,Y) = 0 iff X = Y. They mentioned that if X = Y, then Y - X is the zero matrix, which has rank 0. Conversely, if the rank of Y - X is 0, then Y - X must be the zero matrix, so Y = X. That seems straightforward.\n\nFor the symmetry, d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X) and d(Y,X) = rank(X - Y). But Y - X and X - Y are negatives of each other. In linear algebra, multiplying a matrix by a scalar (in this case, -1, which is non-zero in a field) doesn't change its rank. So rank(Y - X) = rank(-(X - Y)) = rank(X - Y). Therefore, symmetry holds. Maybe the user felt they hand-waved this because they didn't mention the scalar multiplication property explicitly. So to make it rigorous, one should state that scaling by a non-zero element of the field doesn't affect linear independence of rows/columns, hence rank remains the same.\n\nNow, the triangle inequality is the tough part. We need to show rank(Y - X) ≤ rank(Z - X) + rank(Y - Z). Let's rewrite the matrices. Let A = Z - X and B = Y - Z. Then Y - X = (Y - Z) + (Z - X) = B + A. So the problem reduces to showing rank(A + B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B). \n\nWait, is that a standard inequality in linear algebra? I think there is a property that rank(A + B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B). Let me recall. Yes, in general, the rank of the sum of two matrices is less than or equal to the sum of their ranks. Because the column space of A + B is contained in the sum of the column spaces of A and B. The dimension of the sum of two subspaces is less than or equal to the sum of their dimensions. So rank(A + B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B). Therefore, applying this here, since Y - X = (Z - X) + (Y - Z), their ranks add up. Therefore, the triangle inequality holds. \n\nBut let me make sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose A and B are two matrices. Then rank(A + B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B). For instance, if A is a matrix of rank 1 and B is another matrix of rank 1, their sum can have rank at most 2. Which is true. If they are linearly dependent, the rank could be 1. So yes, the inequality holds. Therefore, substituting A and B as above, the triangle inequality is satisfied.\n\nSo putting it all together, the key assumptions here are that the set is all m×n matrices over a field, the distance is defined via the rank of the difference matrix, and we need to verify all four metric axioms. The user was specifically concerned about symmetry and triangle inequality. For symmetry, the key point is that rank is invariant under scalar multiplication by non-zero scalars. For triangle inequality, the key is the subadditivity of rank with respect to matrix addition.\n\nThe original problem statement is about showing that matrices with the rank distance form a metric space, so the problem is structured with the assumptions about the space (m×n matrices over a field) and the definition of the distance function. The user's problem is to prove this, with emphasis on the triangle inequality.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions: the set is m×n matrices over a field, the distance is defined as rank(Y - X), and then the problem is to prove this is a metric space. But according to the example, assumptions are listed as line by line conditions applied to one object each. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The set consists of all m×n matrices over a field.\n- The distance function d(X,Y) is defined as the rank of Y - X.\n- The rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (or column space, since they are equal).\n- The field over which the matrices are defined allows the computation of ranks (which it does, as rank is defined for matrices over any field).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, maybe the key assumptions are just the structure of the space and the definition of d. The user already mentions that they know the rank is the number of linearly independent rows or something like that. So perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\n- X, Y, Z are m×n matrices over a field.\n- The distance d(X,Y) is the rank of the matrix Y - X.\n\nSo, following the example, each assumption is one condition applied to one object. So the problem is to prove that with these definitions, the set is a metric space. Therefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption: \nThe set consists of all m×n matrices over a field,\nThe distance function d(X,Y) is defined as the rank of the matrix Y - X,\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row or column space,\nThe field allows the computation of matrix ranks.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem's given or definitions. The user said \"the set of all m by b matrices over some field is a metric space with respect to the rank distance d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X)\". So the problem is given that set and that distance function, prove it's a metric. So the assumptions are:\n\n- The set is all m×n matrices over a field.\n- The distance is defined by d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X).\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the metric space axioms, the key assumptions are the structure of the set and the definition of the distance. The other facts about rank (like rank(A) = rank(-A)) are part of the properties needed for the proof but perhaps not listed as assumptions. The example given by the user included in the formatted problem the specific conditions on n (being integer and divisible by 7). So in this case, the assumptions are the structure of the space and the definition of the distance. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set is all m×n matrices over a field,\nThe distance function is defined as d(X,Y) = rank(Y - X).\n\nProblem: Prove that the set forms a metric space under the rank distance.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about matrices over a field with the rank distance. So the assumptions are the objects (matrices) and the distance function. Then the problem is to verify the metric space axioms. So following the user's example, the assumptions would list each key property:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set consists of m×n matrices over a field,\nThe distance between two matrices X and Y is defined as the rank of Y - X.\n\nProblem: Prove that this set equipped with the rank distance forms a metric space.\n\nBut since the problem is structured for someone to answer, it's better to have the problem statement encapsulate the original question. The user's original title was \"Matrices equipped with the rank distance form a metric space\", so perhaps the problem statement is as such.\n\nBut the example had the problem line as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, it should be \"Prove that the set of all m×n matrices over a field, equipped with the rank distance, forms a metric space.\"\n\nBut according to the user's original question, they wrote:\n\n\"Prove it is a metric space. The set of all $m$ by $b$ matrices over some field is a metric space with respect to the rank distance $d(X,Y)=\\operatorname{rank}(Y-X)$\"\n\nSo the problem is exactly that. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given structure (m×n matrices over a field) and the definition of the distance function.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set consists of all m×n matrices over a field,\nThe distance function d(X,Y) is defined as the rank of Y - X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that this set equipped with the rank distance forms a metric space.\n\nI think that's correct. The key is that each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The first assumption is about the set, the second about the distance function. Then the problem is to prove the metric space properties.",
