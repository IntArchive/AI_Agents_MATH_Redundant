    "Content": "How can I prove that, if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with inner product and $T$ a linear operator in $V$, then the range of $T^*$ is the orthogonal complement of the null space of $T$? I know what I must do (for a $v$ in the range of $T^*$, I have to show that $v\\perp w$ for every $w$ in $\\ker(T)$ and then do the opposite), but I don't know how to show that this inner product is zero.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In order to show that the range of $T^*$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\ker T$, we have to show that $\\forall v \\in \\operatorname{Im}T^*$, $\\forall w\\in \\ker T$: $\\left<v,w\\right>=0$. Note that vectors in the range of $T^*$ are of the form $T^*v$ for $v\\in V$. Now, let $w\\in\\ker T $. We have to show that $\\left<T^*v,w\\right>=0$. And, indeed, $\\left<T^*v,w\\right>=\\left<v,Tw\\right>=\\left<v,0\\right>=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"The range of $T^*$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\ker(T)$\", and the question is asking how to prove that if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with an inner product and $T$ is a linear operator on $V$, then the range of $T^*$ (the adjoint operator) is the orthogonal complement of the null space (kernel) of $T$. The user mentions they know they need to show that for any $v$ in the range of $T^*$, $v$ is orthogonal to every $w$ in $\\ker(T)$, and vice versa, but they're stuck on showing the inner product is zero.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given conditions in the problem:\n\n1. $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space. This is a key assumption because in infinite-dimensional spaces, properties like the closedness of ranges might not hold, but here finite dimensionality ensures certain properties like the existence of adjoints and orthogonal complements working nicely.\n\n2. $V$ has an inner product. The problem deals with orthogonal complements and adjoint operators, which are defined with respect to an inner product. Without an inner product, these concepts wouldn't make sense.\n\n3. $T$ is a linear operator on $V$. The problem is about the operator $T$ and its adjoint $T^*$, so linearity is essential here.\n\n4. The problem involves the adjoint operator $T^*$, which exists because we have an inner product space. The existence of the adjoint is guaranteed in finite-dimensional inner product spaces.\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The original problem didn't explicitly state some of these, like the existence of the adjoint, but in the context of finite-dimensional spaces with inner products, that's implied. However, to be thorough, the assumptions should include all necessary conditions for the problem to hold true.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n- $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space,\n- $V$ is equipped with an inner product,\n- $T$ is a linear operator on $V$,\n- $T^*$ is the adjoint operator of $T$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the range of $T^*$ is the orthogonal complement of the null space of $T$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on $n$ (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are about the structure of $V$ and the operators involved. Each bullet point addresses one property: the vector space's dimension, the existence of an inner product, the linearity of $T$, and the existence of $T^*$. Each is a separate condition applied to one object.\n\nI think that's accurate. The original problem statement mentions \"if $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with inner product and $T$ a linear operator in $V$\", so those are the key points. The adjoint operator $T^*$ is part of the problem's context, so including it as an assumption makes sense.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For instance, the problem might require that $V$ is over the complex or real numbers, but since it's not specified, perhaps it's general. However, typically, adjoint operators are considered in real or complex inner product spaces. But the problem as stated doesn't specify the field, so maybe it's left general. Since the original problem doesn't mention the field, I shouldn't add that as an assumption unless necessary. The user's example didn't include field specifications either, so maybe it's okay.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these four assumptions. Let me verify with the example structure. The example had two assumptions: $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. Each was a separate line. Similarly, here each condition about $V$ and $T$ is separate.\n\nYes, this seems correct. The problem is then to prove the statement about the range of $T^*$ and the orthogonal complement of the kernel of $T$.",
