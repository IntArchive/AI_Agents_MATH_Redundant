    "Content": "Let $X$ be a normed linear space with norm $||\\cdot||$ and $A \\neq \\emptyset$ a linear subspace of $X$ . Prove that $\\bar{A}$ is also a linear subspace of $X$ .

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Show that the closure $\\overline Y$ of a subspace $Y$ of a normed space $X$ is again a vector subspace. Proof :\nSuppose $x, y \\in \\overline Y$. There are three cases we must consider. If $x, y \\in Y$ then it is immediate that $x + y \\in Y$ since $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ and thus $x + y \\in \\overline Y$. If $x \\in \\overline Y \\setminus Y$ and $y \\in Y$ then by definition, given $\\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $x_0 \\in Y$ with $x_0 \\neq x$ such that $d(x_0, x) = \\|x_0 - x\\| < \\varepsilon$. Now observe that since $x_0 \\neq x$ then $x_0 + y \\neq x + y$ and $x_0 + y \\in Y$. Now we have $d(x_0 + y, x + y) = \\|x_0 + y - x - y\\| = \\|x_0 - x\\| < \\varepsilon$. Hence we can conclude that $x_0 + y$ is an accumulation point of $Y$. Hence $x + y \\in \\overline Y$. If $x, y \\in \\overline Y \\setminus Y$ then by definition given $\\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $x_0 \\in Y$ with $x_0 \\neq x$ such that $d(x_0, x) = \\|x_0 - x\\| < \\varepsilon/2$. Similarly, there exists $y_0 \\in Y$ with $y_0 \\neq y$ such that $d(y_0, y) = \\|y_0 - y\\| < \\varepsilon/2$. If $x_0 + y_0 = x + y$ choose some $x_0 \\neq x_0' \\in Y$ such that $d(x_0', x) = \\|x_0' - x\\| < \\varepsilon/2$ which is true since there are infinitely many elements in $Y$ with that property. So suppose without loss of generality that $x_0 + y_0 \\neq x + y$. It follows that $$d(x_0 + y_0, x + y) = \\|x_0 + y_0 - x - y\\| \\leq \\|x_0 - x\\| + \\|y_0 - y\\| < \\frac\\varepsilon2 + \\frac\\varepsilon2 = \\varepsilon.$$ Hence we have shown that $x + y$ is an accumulation point of $Y$ and hence $x + y \\in \\overline Y$. Now suppose $x \\in \\overline Y$. Suppose $\\alpha$ is a scalar. We must consider two cases. If $x \\in Y$ then since $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ it follows immediately that $\\alpha x \\in Y$ and thus $\\alpha x \\in \\overline Y$. If $x \\in \\overline Y \\setminus Y$ then $x$ is an accumulation point of $Y$. By definition given $\\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $x_0 \\in Y$ with $x_0 \\neq x$ such that $d(x_0, x) = \\|x_0 - x\\| < \\varepsilon/(\\vert \\alpha \\vert + 1)$. Now since $x_0 \\neq x$ then $\\alpha x_0 \\neq \\alpha x$ and observe that $$d(\\alpha x_0, \\alpha x) = \\|\\alpha x_0 - \\alpha x \\| = \\vert \\alpha \\vert \\|x_0 - x\\| < \\vert \\alpha \\vert \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\vert \\alpha \\vert +1} < \\varepsilon.$$ Thus we have shown that $\\alpha x$ is an accumulation point and we can conclude that $\\alpha x \\in \\overline Y$. Thus we can conclude that $\\overline Y$ is a subspace of $X$. Note : It is my understanding that the closure of a set is the set along with all its limit points or accumulation points. It is my understanding that it NOT implied that all the elements of a set are limit points of the set. Please correct me if I'm wrong here!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The original problem here is about proving that the closure of a linear subspace in a normed space is also a linear subspace.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that X is a normed linear space with a norm ||·||. Then, A is a non-empty linear subspace of X. The task is to prove that the closure of A, denoted as bar{A}, is also a linear subspace of X.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. X is a normed linear space.\n2. The norm on X is ||·||.\n3. A is a non-empty subset of X.\n4. A is a linear subspace of X.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"A ≠ ∅ a linear subspace of X\". So, A is non-empty and a linear subspace. But in the example, the assumptions split into two: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So, here, maybe split into two separate assumptions: \"A is a non-empty set\" and \"A is a linear subspace of X\". Also, the normed space X is another assumption. The norm ||·|| is part of the definition of X, but maybe list it as a separate assumption for clarity, as in \"The norm on X is ||·||\".\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- The norm on X is ||·||.\n- A is a non-empty set.\n- A is a linear subspace of X.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the closure of A (bar{A}) is also a linear subspace of X.\n\nI need to check if these assumptions are correctly split and each addresses one property. Let me verify. The normed space X is one assumption. The norm is part of X's structure, but maybe in the problem statement, they mention \"with norm ||·||\", so listing the norm separately as an assumption makes sense. Then, A is non-empty and a linear subspace. Since the problem specifies \"A ≠ ∅ a linear subspace\", those are two separate conditions: non-emptiness and being a subspace. Hence, each should be a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a normed linear space,\nThe norm on X is ||·||,\nA is a non-empty set,\nA is a linear subspace of X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\bar{A}$ is also a linear subspace of $X$.\n\nI think that's correct. The example had assumptions split into different lines even if they applied to the same object (like n being integer and n divisible by 7). Similarly here, each condition on A is separate. The problem statement then is about proving the closure is a subspace.",
