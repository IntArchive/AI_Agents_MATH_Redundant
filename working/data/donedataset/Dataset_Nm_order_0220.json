    "Content": "My linear algebra professor proved that Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in set of $n \\times n$ complex matrices. He defined a metric (I believe) that was somehow related to the usual metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. Then somehow proved that diagonalizable matrices were dense because for any matrix $A$ if $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$ on an open subset, then $\\det(A - \\lambda I)$ was the zero polynomial. I Googled around a bit and found some stuff talking about the Zariski topology, and I am not sure this is what I want. Most of what I have found on this topology is much more general than what he was doing. Does anyone know any resources that would explain how to go about proving this statement? Edit: I found out how to prove this the way my professor did. We define the norm of a matrix by\n$$ |A| = \\max\\{|Ax| : |x| = 1 \\}.$$\nNow we have a distance $d(A, B) < \\epsilon$. You can prove that if $(A - B)_{ij} < \\epsilon/n$, then $|A - B| < \\epsilon$. Let $p(x)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$, an $n \\times n$ matrix. \n$$p(x) = \\prod_1^n (x - x_i) = x^n + (-1)\\sigma_1 x^{n - 1} + \\cdots + (-1)^n\\sigma_n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_n$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials of $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ which are the eigenvalues. The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is a symmetric polynomial, therefore it can be written in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, which in turn can be written in terms of the entries of the matrix. But since the discriminant is a polynomial, it only has finitely many roots. Therefore for $\\epsilon > 0$, by changing the entries of the matrix less than $\\epsilon / n$ we can find a new matrix $B$ such that $|B - A| < \\epsilon$ and the discriminant is not zero. The discriminant being not zero means $B$ has distinct eigenvalues, thus has a basis of eigenvectors. Therefore, it is diagonalizable. Thus the set of diagonalizable matrices is dense in the set of matrices with respect to that metric.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I cannot really follow the reasoning you are hinting in your question, but here's my take: To talk about density you need a topology. Since $M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ , the space of complex $n\\times n$ matrices is finite-dimensional (which implies that there is a single locally convex topology), a very natural notion of convergence is entry-wise; so we can consider the metric $$\nd(A,B)=\\max\\{ |A_{kj}-B_{kj}|\\ : k,j=1,\\ldots,n\\}, \\ \\ \\ A,B\\in M_n(\\mathbb{C}).\n$$ It is not hard to check that for any matrix $C$ , $$\nd(CA,CB)\\leq d(A,B)\\,\\sum_{k,j=1}^n |C_{kj}|,\n$$ and the same inequality holds for multiplication on the right (this will be used in the last inequality below). Now take any $A\\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ . Let $J$ be its Jordan canonical form; then there exists a non-singular matrix $S$ such that $J=SAS^{-1}$ . Fix $\\varepsilon>0$ . Let $$\nm=\\left(\\sum_{k,j=1}^n |S_{kj}|\\right)\\,\\left(\\sum_{k,j=1}^n |(S^{-1})_{kj}|\\right)\n$$ The matrix $J$ is upper triangular, so its eigenvalues (which are those of $A$ ) are the diagonal entries. Let $J'$ be the matrix obtained from $J$ by perturbing the diagonal entries of $J$ by less than $\\varepsilon/m$ in such a way that all the diagonal entries of $J'$ are distinct. But now $J'$ is diagonalizable, since it has $n$ distinct eigenvalues. And $d(J,J')<\\varepsilon/m$ .  Then $S^{-1}J'S$ is diagonalizable and $$\nd(S^{-1}J'S,A)=d(S^{-1}J'S,S^{-1}JS)\\leq m\\,d(J',J)<\\varepsilon.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user is talking about diagonalizable matrices being dense in the set of n×n complex matrices. The original question mentions that the professor used a metric related to the usual metric on R^(n^2), and there's some stuff about the characteristic polynomial, discriminant, and eigenvalues. The key points seem to be: proving that diagonalizable matrices are dense by showing you can perturb any matrix slightly (in terms of the matrix norm) to get a matrix with distinct eigenvalues (since matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable). The user also mentions the Zariski topology but decides to go with the approach using the matrix norm and discriminant.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would include things like the metric defined by the matrix norm, the relation between the matrix entries and the discriminant, and the fact that the discriminant being non-zero implies distinct eigenvalues. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition on one object.\n\nFirst, the problem is about n×n complex matrices. The metric used is the operator norm, defined as |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}, and the distance between matrices A and B is d(A,B) < ε. Then, there's the fact that if the entries of (A - B) are each less than ε/n, then the norm |A - B| is less than ε. The characteristic polynomial of A is given, with its discriminant being a symmetric polynomial, hence expressible in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials (which relate to the matrix entries). The discriminant has only finitely many roots, so by perturbing entries slightly (less than ε/n), you can make the discriminant non-zero, leading to distinct eigenvalues and thus diagonalizability. \n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The set of matrices considered are n×n complex matrices.\n2. A metric is defined by the matrix norm |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}.\n3. The distance between two matrices A and B is given by d(A,B) = |A - B|.\n4. If each entry of (A - B) has absolute value less than ε/n, then |A - B| < ε.\n5. The characteristic polynomial of a matrix A has a discriminant that is a symmetric polynomial in the eigenvalues.\n6. The discriminant can be expressed as a polynomial in the entries of the matrix.\n7. The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial has finitely many roots (i.e., matrices with repeated eigenvalues are in the zero set of the discriminant polynomial).\n8. Perturbing the entries of a matrix A by less than ε/n can result in a matrix B with non-zero discriminant (hence distinct eigenvalues).\n9. Matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable.\n\nBut the problem itself is to prove that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices under the given metric. The user's approach uses the norm and perturbing entries to achieve distinct eigenvalues. The key assumptions needed for the problem would be those related to the metric, the discriminant being a polynomial with finite roots, and the perturbation leading to non-zero discriminant. However, the problem statement itself might not need all these assumptions listed. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, the assumption listed was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in that case, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the original problem's conditions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be an error. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But in the example, the formatted problem's assumption includes n divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Hmm, maybe there was a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user intended to show how to structure a problem where an assumption was added. But maybe the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem did? Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But 91 is 7×13, so perhaps the correct assumption is that n is an integer, but the divisibility by 7 and 13 comes from the structure. Maybe in the example, the answer needed to assume n is divisible by 7? That seems off. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, for our current problem, we need to list the assumptions based on the problem's content.\n\nLooking back at the problem: The user wants to prove that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices. The approach uses the metric induced by the operator norm, shows that perturbing entries slightly leads to a matrix with distinct eigenvalues (since the discriminant is a polynomial that's non-zero in an open dense set), hence diagonalizable.\n\nSo the assumptions needed would be:\n\n- The space is n×n complex matrices.\n- The topology is induced by the metric d(A,B) = |A - B|, where |A| is the operator norm.\n- The characteristic polynomial's discriminant is a polynomial in the matrix entries.\n- The set of matrices with distinct eigenvalues (i.e., non-zero discriminant) is dense.\n\nBut the problem is the original statement: Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices. So the problem is to prove that. The assumptions would be the necessary conditions that are given or used in the proof.\n\nIn the user's own explanation, they mention defining the norm, the relation between entry-wise perturbation and the norm, the characteristic polynomial's discriminant being a polynomial in entries, which has finitely many roots, hence perturbing entries allows avoiding those roots, leading to non-zero discriminant and thus diagonalizability.\n\nSo the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set of matrices considered is the set of n×n complex matrices.\n- The topology is induced by the metric d(A,B) = |A - B|, where |A| is the operator norm defined as |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}.\n- The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix.\n- The set of matrices with repeated eigenvalues corresponds to the zero set of the discriminant polynomial.\n- A matrix with distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property applied to one object. Let me parse each:\n\n1. The space of n×n complex matrices is considered.\n2. The metric d(A,B) is defined by the operator norm |A - B|.\n3. The operator norm |A| is defined as the maximum of |Ax| for |x| = 1.\n4. Perturbing each entry of a matrix by less than ε/n results in a matrix B with |B - A| < ε.\n5. The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is a polynomial in the entries of the matrix.\n6. The set of matrices with repeated eigenvalues is the zero set of the discriminant polynomial.\n7. A matrix with distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove density under the given metric. So the assumptions would include the metric, the discriminant being a polynomial (hence its zero set is closed and nowhere dense), and that diagonalizable matrices include those with distinct eigenvalues.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the ones that are given in the problem's setup. The problem is about complex matrices, uses the operator norm metric, and the fact that matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable. The rest are steps in the proof, not assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set of matrices is the space of n×n complex matrices.\n- The topology is induced by the operator norm metric d(A,B) = |A - B|.\n- The discriminant of a matrix's characteristic polynomial is a polynomial in the matrix entries.\n- A matrix with distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and then added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which might have been part of the problem's actual conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Unless the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, for the current problem, the user's own explanation details the steps, so we need to extract the assumptions from their proof sketch.\n\nThe user mentions:\n\n- The norm is defined as |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}\n- d(A,B) < ε\n- If (A - B)_{ij} < ε/n, then |A - B| < ε\n- The characteristic polynomial p(x) has discriminant which is a symmetric polynomial, hence expressible via elementary symmetric polynomials (which are entries of the matrix)\n- Discriminant is a polynomial, so finite roots, so perturbing entries allows getting non-zero discriminant\n- Hence, B has distinct eigenvalues and is diagonalizable\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n1. The metric is induced by the operator norm.\n2. Entry-wise perturbations control the operator norm.\n3. The discriminant is a polynomial in matrix entries.\n4. Non-zero discriminant implies distinct eigenvalues.\n5. Matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property applied to one object. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space of n×n complex matrices is equipped with the metric induced by the operator norm |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}.\n- For any matrices A and B, if |(A - B)_{ij}| < ε/n for all entries (i,j), then |A - B| < ε.\n- The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is a polynomial function of its entries.\n- The set of matrices with repeated eigenvalues is the zero set of the discriminant polynomial.\n- A matrix with distinct eigenvalues over the complex numbers is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the space of n×n complex matrices with respect to the operator norm metric.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in set of $n\\times n$ complex matrices.\" So the problem is to prove that. The user's approach uses the operator norm, but other metrics (like entry-wise) could also be considered, but in this case, the professor used a specific metric.\n\nBut according to the user's edit, they used the operator norm and showed that perturbing entries by ε/n gives a matrix within ε in norm. Hence, the key assumptions are the relation between entry perturbations and the operator norm, and the discriminant being a polynomial.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as per the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The space under consideration is the set of all n×n complex matrices.\n- The topology is induced by the operator norm metric d(A,B) = |A - B|, where |A| = max{|Ax| : |x| = 1}.\n- If each entry of a matrix B differs from A by less than ε/n, then |B - A| < ε.\n- The discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is a polynomial in the matrix's entries.\n- The set of matrices with repeated eigenvalues is the zero set of the discriminant polynomial.\n- A complex matrix with distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.\n\nProblem:\nProve that diagonalizable matrices are dense in the set of n×n complex matrices with respect to the operator norm metric.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is simply \"Diagonalizable matrices with complex values are dense in set of $n\\times n$ complex matrices.\" So perhaps the problem statement doesn't need to mention the metric, but the user's approach does. However, in the example given earlier, the problem statement was rephrased to include the specific expression. But the user's own formatted problem in the example included the expression and specific divisibility. Here, the original problem is to prove density, and the assumptions would be the ones used in the proof.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is just as in the title, and the assumptions are the properties used to prove it. So the problem is as stated in the title, and the assumptions are the required conditions for that proof.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n- Working in the space of n×n complex matrices.\n- The metric is induced by the operator norm.\n- Perturbations in entries control the norm.\n- Discriminant is a polynomial, hence its zero set is closed and nowhere dense.\n- Matrices with distinct eigenvalues are diagonalizable.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and the problem statement.",
