    "Content": "I'm an undergrad student fairly keen on algebra. Over the different algebra courses I've taken, I've often encountered the so-called $p$-Prüfer group on exercises but somehow never got around to them. Now I'm trying to take care of that, but there are some statements I've seen about this group which I don't know how to prove (maybe because I lack some more background in group theory, especially in the study of infinite abelian groups?) Definition A $p$-group is a $p$-Prüfer group if it is isomorphic to $$C_{p^\\infty}=\\{e^{\\frac{2k\\pi i}{p^n}}:k\\in \\mathbb{Z}, n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+\\} \\subset (\\mathbb{C}^\\times, \\cdot)$$ What I'm having trouble to prove is: The following are $p$-Prüfer groups: 1) An infinite $p$-group whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion, 2) An infinite $p$-group such that every finite subset generates a cyclic group, 3) An infinite abelian $p$-group such that $G$ is isomorphic to every proper quotient, 4) An infinite abelian $p$-group such that every subgroup is finite Just for the record, what I (think I) could prove was that the following are $p$-Prüfer groups: 5) An injective envelope of $C_{p^n}$, for any $n\\geq 1$, 6) A Sylow $p$-subgroup of $\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}}{\\mathbb{Z}}$, 7) The direct limit of $0\\subset C_p \\subset C_{p^2}\\subset ...$ Here $C_{p^n}$ denotes a cyclic group of order $p^n$. Any other characterizations of the $p$-Prüfer group are welcome.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "How one procedes to prove these probably depends a bit on which description of the $p$-Prüfer group one is most comfortable with. So my particular arguments may not seem very natural to you, in which case this will probably not help much. Because the subgroups are ordered by inclusion, given any $x,y\\in G$, either $x\\in\\langle y\\rangle$ or $y\\in\\langle x\\rangle$. Take an element $x_1\\in G$. The subgroup it generates cannot be all of $G$ (it is finite, since $G$ is a $p$-group), so there exists $x_2\\in G$ with $x_2\\notin\\langle x_1\\rangle$. Therefore, $x_1\\in\\langle x_2\\rangle$. But $x_2$ cannot generate all of $G$. So there exists $x_3\\in G$, $x_3\\notin \\langle x_2\\rangle$. Continuing this way, you obtain a (countably infinite) collection of elements of $G$, $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,$ such that $x_n\\in\\langle x_{n+1}\\rangle$, $x_{n+1}\\notin\\langle x_n\\rangle$. By introducing suitable elements into the sequence, we may assume that $[\\langle x_{n+1}\\rangle\\colon\\langle x_n\\rangle]=p$. Now prove that the subgroup generated by all the $x_i$ is isomorphic to the $p$-Prüfer group, and that it is equal to $G$. Let $x_1\\in G$. It does not generate all of $G$, so let $y\\in G$ that is not in $\\langle x_1\\rangle$. Then $\\langle x_1,y\\rangle$ is cyclic, strictly larger than $\\langle x_1\\rangle$; let $x_2$ be a generator of this cyclic group. Since $x_2$ does not generate all of $G$, there exists $y\\in G$ not in $\\langle x_2\\rangle$; but $\\langle x_2,y\\rangle$ is cyclic, so let $x_3$ be a generator. Lather, rinse, repeat, to get an infinite sequence as above, adding elements if necessary to get each step to increase the size of the cyclic group by $p$; that is, $x_n$ is of order $p^n$. Again, prove the group generated by the $x_i$ is the $p$-Prüfer group and equal to all of $G$. I'd written suitable arguments for 3 and 4, but Jack has posted them as well and they are essentially the same, so I'll defer to him on them.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Then the problem is stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the user is asking about characterizations of the p-Prüfer group. The question lists several properties (1-4) that are claimed to characterize the p-Prüfer group and the user is having trouble proving these. The task is to format each of these characterizations into separate problems following the example.\n\nEach of the four points (1-4) should be a separate problem with their own assumptions. Let's break them down one by one.\n\n1) An infinite p-group whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion.\nAssumptions here would be: the group is infinite, it's a p-group, and its subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion.\n\n2) An infinite p-group where every finite subset generates a cyclic group.\nAssumptions: infinite p-group, every finite subset generates a cyclic group.\n\n3) An infinite abelian p-group isomorphic to every proper quotient.\nAssumptions: infinite, abelian, p-group, isomorphic to every proper quotient.\n\n4) An infinite abelian p-group where every subgroup is finite.\nAssumptions: infinite, abelian, p-group, every subgroup is finite.\n\nEach of these needs to be separated into individual problems with their respective assumptions listed line by line. The problem statement would then be proving that such a group is a p-Prüfer group. However, looking at the example, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" In the original question, the user wants to show that each characterization is a p-Prüfer group, so the problem part should be \"Prove that [the group] is a p-Prüfer group.\"\n\nWait, the example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, each characterization should be a problem where the group under the given assumptions is a p-Prüfer group. Therefore, each problem will be structured with the assumptions listed and the problem being to prove it's a p-Prüfer group.\n\nNow, let's check the example again. The original problem in the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property.\n\nApplying that here, for each of the four characterizations, list each assumption on a separate line. Let me verify each point:\n\n1) An infinite p-group whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion.\nAssumptions:\n- The group is infinite.\n- The group is a p-group.\n- All subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is a p-Prüfer group.\n\nSimilarly for the others. Let's check point 2:\n\n2) An infinite p-group such that every finite subset generates a cyclic group.\nAssumptions:\n- The group is infinite.\n- The group is a p-group.\n- Every finite subset generates a cyclic group.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is a p-Prüfer group.\n\nPoint 3:\n\n3) An infinite abelian p-group such that G is isomorphic to every proper quotient.\nAssumptions:\n- The group is infinite.\n- The group is abelian.\n- The group is a p-group.\n- The group is isomorphic to every proper quotient.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is a p-Prüfer group.\n\nPoint 4:\n\n4) An infinite abelian p-group such that every subgroup is finite.\nAssumptions:\n- The group is infinite.\n- The group is abelian.\n- The group is a p-group.\n- Every subgroup is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that the group is a p-Prüfer group.\n\nEach of these four points should be structured as separate problem entries following the format. The original question lists them as four different characterizations, so each becomes its own problem with its own assumptions.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is only one property per line. For example, in point 3, \"infinite abelian p-group\" is three separate properties: infinite, abelian, p-group. Similarly for others.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Now, format each of the four points accordingly.",
