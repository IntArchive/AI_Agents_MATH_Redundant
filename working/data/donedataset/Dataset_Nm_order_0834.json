    "Content": "How to prove $f(x)=\\log\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}\\right)$ is a convex function?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof: Let $u_i=e^ {x_i} ,v_i=e^ {y_i}$ . So $f(\\theta x+(1-\\theta)y)=\\log(\\sum_ {i=1}^n e^{\\theta x_i + (1-\\theta)y_i})=\\log(\\sum_ {i=1}^n u_i^ \\theta v_i^{(1-\\theta)})$ From Hölder's inequality: $$\\sum_ {i=1}^n x_iy_i \\le (\\sum_ {i=1}^n|x_i|^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\cdot (\\sum_ {i=1}^n|y_i|^q)^{\\frac{1}{q}}$$ where $1/p+1/q=1$ . Applying this inequality to $f(\\theta x+(1-\\theta)y)$ : $$\\log(\\sum_ {i=1}^n u_i^ \\theta v_i^{(1-\\theta)}) \\le \n\\log[(\\sum_ {i=1}^n u_i^ {\\theta \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\theta}})^ \\theta \\cdot \n(\\sum_ {i=1}^n v_i^ {1-\\theta \\cdot \\frac{1}{1-\\theta}})^ {1-\\theta}]$$ The right formula can be reduced to: $$\\theta \\log\\left(\\sum_ {i=1}^n u_i\\right)+(1-\\theta)\\log \\left(\\sum_ {i=1}^n v_i \\right)$$ Here I regard $\\theta$ as $\\frac{1}{p}$ and $1-\\theta$ as $\\frac{1}{q}$ . So I achieve that $f(\\theta x+(1-\\theta)y) \\le \\theta f(x) + (1-\\theta)f(y)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, each applying to one object or property. Then, the problem statement is presented clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: the user is asking why the log-sum-exp function f(x) = log(sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}) is convex on R^n. The question has some edits, but the main task is to prove convexity. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all assumptions. The function f is defined for x in R^n, so the domain is R^n. The function is a composition of exponentials and a logarithm. The problem doesn't state any restrictions like differentiability or specific values of n, but the function is defined for any n ≥ 1. However, in the assumptions, we need to list each condition.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- x is an element of R^n (the domain)\n- The function f is defined as the logarithm of the sum of exponentials of each component of x.\n\nWait, the problem statement itself is to prove convexity. The original question mentions that the user tried using the given inequalities with max{x_i} but that didn't work, and then they posted their own answer. However, for the formatted problem, we need to extract only the necessary assumptions and the problem. The edits (EDIT1 and EDIT2) might contain extra info, but the core problem is proving convexity.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are about the function's definition and the domain. The problem is to prove that f is convex. The original problem doesn't specify any additional conditions beyond x being in R^n. The inequalities mentioned in EDIT1 are part of their attempted approach but aren't assumptions of the problem itself. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a vector in R^n,\nf(x) is defined as log(sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}).\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) is a convex function.\n\nWait, the original problem's title mentions x ∈ R^n, which is important. The function's definition is given. So yes, those are the two assumptions. Each on a separate line. Then the problem statement.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single property for one object. Here, \"x is a vector in R^n\" is one assumption about the domain. The definition of f(x) is another assumption about the function. So that's two lines.\n\nThe problem is to prove convexity. So the formatted version should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a vector in R^n,\nf(x) = log(sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}).\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) is a convex function.\n\nThat seems correct. The edits in the original question are about the user's attempts, which we can ignore as per the instructions to filter unrelated information. So the key parts are the domain and the function's definition.",
