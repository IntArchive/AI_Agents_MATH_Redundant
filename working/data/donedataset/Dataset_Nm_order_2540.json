    "Content": "Let $X$ be a variety over algebraically closed field $k$, $\\dim X > 0$, and let $H$ be ample Cartier divisor on X. Suppose $m < 0$. Show that $\\mathcal{O}(mH)$ has no global sections. My result so far is that if $X$ is a complete non-singular curve, then it follows from Riemann-Roch theorem that $H$ being ample implies that $\\deg H > 0$ (since otherwise $kH$ wouldn't be very ample for large enough $k$), so $\\deg mH < 0$ and Riemann-Roch again implies that $\\mathcal{O}(mH)$ has no nonzero global sections. Thus, we can conclude that every global section of $\\mathcal{O}(mH)$ is zero over every complete non-singular $Y \\subset X$. If we could show that the set of points $p \\in X$ that belong to some complete non-singular curve is dense, the result would follow. I'm not sure if that's even true, though. Also, is there a simple argument that avoids using Riemann-Roch here? Can we somehow relax the assumptions on X?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that $X$ is reduced, with positive dimensional connected components, and is projective over a field (which is not implied by the existence of an ample sheaf following standard definition of ample and of very ample). Then it is true that for any $n\\ge 1$, $O_X(-nH)$ has no non-zero global sections. As the restriction of an ample divisor to a connected component is ample, it is enough to work with connected and reduced $X$, in which case $H^0(X, O_X)$ is a field. If $O_X(-nH)$ has a non-zero global section $s$, then for any positive integer $d$, $s^{\\otimes d}$ is a non-zero global section of $O_X(-ndH)$. Now as you said, if $d$ is big enough, $ndH$ is very ample, so \n$ndH$ is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor $D$ (embedd $X$ into some projective space using $O_X(ndH)$, take the trace to $X$ of a hyperplane). We have $D\\ne 0$ because otherwise $X$ would be affine (or if you prefer, a hyperplane in a projective space containing $X$ must meet $X$ when $\\dim X\\ge 1$). This implies that $O_X(-ndH)\\cong O_X(-D)$ is a sheaf of ideals. It is then enough to show that $H^0(X, O_X(-D))=0$. But this follows immediately from the fact that $H^0(X, O_X)$ is a field and any global section of $O_X(-D)$ has a zero somewhere in $X$. If $X$ is not reduced, with sheaf of nilpotent ideals $N$, the question is whether $N(-D)$ has non-zero global section. I think the answer is yes, this can happen. I don't have an explicit example, but it is not clear for me whether you consider non-reduced algebraic varieties...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that for a variety X over an algebraically closed field k, with dimension greater than 0, and H an ample Cartier divisor, then the line bundle O(mH) has no global sections when m is negative. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's see. The variety X is over an algebraically closed field, which is k. The dimension of X is greater than 0. H is an ample Cartier divisor on X. Then m is a negative integer. The problem is to show that O(mH) has no global sections. \n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"Suppose m < 0\". So m is any negative integer. The user has tried using Riemann-Roch for the case when X is a smooth complete curve. They argue that in that case, the degree of H must be positive because H is ample, and then mH would have negative degree, leading to no global sections via Riemann-Roch. Then they want to extend this to higher dimensions by considering curves in X. Their approach is to use that if every point is on a smooth curve, then the result would follow, but they're unsure if that's true. They also ask for a simpler argument without Riemann-Roch and if the assumptions on X can be relaxed.\n\nSo, when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be: X is a variety over an algebraically closed field k, the dimension of X is greater than 0, H is an ample Cartier divisor on X, m is a negative integer. The problem is to show that O(mH) has no global sections.\n\nWait, the original problem didn't mention that X is projective or anything else? The user just says \"variety\", but in algebraic geometry, ampleness usually requires some projectivity or at least properness. But perhaps in the problem's context, they assume X is projective? Hmm. But the user didn't specify. Wait, the original problem says \"variety over algebraically closed field k\", and H is an ample Cartier divisor. So maybe in the problem's setting, X is projective? Because ampleness for Cartier divisors typically requires some properness condition to be meaningful. But the problem statement doesn't specify. However, in the example given by the user in their own answer, they considered a complete non-singular curve, so maybe completeness is part of the assumption. Wait, but the original problem doesn't state that X is complete or projective. Hmm. Maybe that's an oversight? Or perhaps in the problem's context, \"variety\" is assumed to be projective? But standard definitions of variety in algebraic geometry don't always include projectivity. \n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user is trying to use Riemann-Roch on curves, which typically applies to complete curves. So maybe X is supposed to be complete? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"variety over algebraically closed field k, dim X >0\". So the assumptions are: X is a variety (which is usually separated and integral of finite type over k), algebraically closed field k, dimension >0, H is ample Cartier divisor, m <0. Then the problem is to show that O(mH) has no global sections.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions would be each listed as separate points. So:\n\nAssumption: X is a variety over an algebraically closed field k,\nAssumption: the dimension of X is greater than 0,\nAssumption: H is an ample Cartier divisor on X,\nAssumption: m is a negative integer.\n\nProblem: Show that the line bundle O_X(mH) has no global sections.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, no, the user might have made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nAssumption: n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like the example might be incorrect, but the user might have intended that. So maybe the user's example is wrong, but following their instructions, perhaps they want to filter out unrelated information and list all assumptions, even if some were not explicit? Or maybe the original problem had a typo. Hmm. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's problem is as stated. So to follow the example, perhaps we need to extract all assumptions, even if some are implicit.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user says \"Let X be a variety over algebraically closed field k, dim X >0, H ample Cartier divisor. Suppose m <0. Show O(mH) has no global sections.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a variety over algebraically closed k\n\n- dim X >0\n\n- H is an ample Cartier divisor on X\n\n- m is a negative integer.\n\nSo these should each be separate assumptions. The problem is to show O(mH) has no global sections.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user also mentions that in their approach, they considered X being a complete non-singular curve. But the original problem doesn't state that X is complete or non-singular. So perhaps those are extra assumptions in their approach, but the problem as posed is more general. Therefore, when structuring, we only take the explicit assumptions given in the problem statement, not the ones mentioned in the user's attempt.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have the four assumptions as listed above. The problem is to show that O(mH) has no global sections. That should be it.",
