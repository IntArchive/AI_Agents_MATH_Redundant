    "AcceptedAnswer": "I absolutely love this result, I literally cannot stop from getting goosebumps and smiling whenever I think about it. It is a proof from probability theory ! I learned it in David William's Probability with Martingales , of which it is part of exercise E4.2. Fix $s>1$ and recall that $\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} n^{-s}$, so we aim to show that $1/\\zeta(s) = \\prod_p(1-p^{-s})$ where of course $p$ ranges over the primes. First, define a probability measure $P$ and an $\\mathbb{N}$-valued random variable $X$ such that $P(X=n) = n^{-s}/\\zeta(s)$ (for example take $P(\\{n\\}) = n^{-s}/\\zeta(s)$ and $X(\\omega)=\\omega$).  Let $E_k := \\{X \\text{ is divisible by } k\\}$. We claim that the events $(E_p : p \\text{ prime})$ are independent . We note that\n$$\nP(E_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty P(X=ik) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{(ik)^{-s}}{\\zeta(s)} = k^{-s} \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(s)} = k^{-s}.\n$$ Then if $p_1,\\ldots,p_n$ are distinct primes we have $$\\bigcap_{i=1}^n E_{p_i} = E_{\\prod_{i=1}^np_i},$$ so that\n$$\nP\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^n E_{p_i}\\right) = P(E_{\\prod_{i=1}^np_i}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i \\right)^{-s} = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{-s} = \\prod_{i=1}^n P(E_{p_i})\n$$\nso our independence claim is proved.\nThen we note that $1$ is the unique positive integer which is not a multiple of any prime. Hence\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\zeta(s)} = P(X=1) = P\\left(\\bigcap_p E_p^c\\right) = \\prod_p(1-P(E_p)) = \\prod_p(1-p^{-s}).\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the product of 1/(1 - p^{-s}) over all primes p equals the sum of 1/n^s from n=1 to infinity, which is the Riemann zeta function. They mentioned using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and infinite geometric series.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that each term 1/(1 - p^{-s}) can be expanded as a geometric series: 1 + 1/p^s + 1/p^{2s} + 1/p^{3s} + ... and so on. So when we take the product over all primes, each term in the product is such a series.\n\nNow, multiplying all these series together means we're taking every possible combination of terms, one from each prime's series. For example, taking 1/p^s from the first prime, 1/q^{2s} from the second, and so on. When we multiply these, we get terms like 1/(p^s * q^{2s} * ...) which is 1/( (p * q^2 * ... )^s ). \n\nBut according to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, every integer n > 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of primes raised to some exponents. So each term in the product's expansion corresponds to a unique integer n, constructed by choosing exponents for each prime. The denominator becomes n^s, and since every n is represented exactly once, the entire product of series should sum up to the sum over all n of 1/n^s. That's the zeta function.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned a \"simple and elegant way\" through the above list. Maybe I need to structure this argument more formally. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Expand each 1/(1 - p^{-s}) into its geometric series.\n2. Take the product over all primes, which results in multiplying all these series.\n3. Each term in the product corresponds to choosing an exponent for each prime (possibly zero, but since primes are infinite, maybe we need to consider only finite exponents except for the primes in the factorization of n).\n4. By the Fundamental Theorem, each combination of exponents corresponds to a unique integer n, hence the product of the series equals the sum over n of 1/n^s.\n\nBut the user's original problem might need to clarify the assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user listed the primes in order, wrote out their geometric series expansions, and mentions the Fundamental Theorem. The problem is to show that the product equals the sum. The assumptions would include that p is prime, s > 1, and that every integer has a unique prime factorization. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition separately.\n\nSo for the Assumptions section:\n\n- Each term in the product is over primes p in the set of all primes ℙ.\n- For each prime p, the term 1/(1 - p^{-s}) is expanded as an infinite geometric series.\n- The variable s is a real number greater than 1.\n- Every integer n > 1 can be factored uniquely into primes (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).\n- The product of these series expansions includes all combinations of exponents for primes.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property per line. Let me parse that.\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime number (i.e., p ∈ ℙ).\n- The product is taken over all prime numbers in ℙ.\n- For each prime p, the equality 1/(1 - p^{-s}) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ (1/p^{s})^k holds (geometric series).\n- The real number s satisfies s > 1.\n- Every integer n ≥ 1 has a unique prime factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).\n\nProblem: Prove that ∏_{p ∈ ℙ} 1/(1 - p^{-s}) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s using the given expansions and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\nYes, that seems to capture the necessary assumptions and the problem statement. The key points are the geometric series expansion for each prime, the product over all primes, s > 1 for convergence, and unique factorization enabling the correspondence between product terms and sum terms.",
