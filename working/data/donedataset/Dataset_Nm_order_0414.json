    "AcceptedAnswer": "Use induction on $k$. For $k=0$, we have $$(n+1)\\int_{0}^{1}(1-x)^{n}dx=-(1-x)^{n+1}\\Big|_0^1=1=\\binom{n}{0}^{-1}.$$\nNow assume that it's true for all $k\\leq n-1$ (if $k=n$ we are done), i.e. \n$$\\binom{n}{k}^{-1}=(n+1)\\int_{0}^{1}x^{k}(1-x)^{n-k}dx.$$\nConsider $(n+1)\\int_{0}^{1}x^{k+1}(1-x)^{n-k-1}dx$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the inverse of the binomial coefficient, specifically 1 over binomial(n, k), is equal to (n+1) times the integral from 0 to 1 of x^k times (1-x)^{n-k} dx, for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some integral formulas related to binomial coefficients. The integral given resembles the Beta function, which is connected to the Gamma function. Remember that the Beta function B(a, b) is the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1} dx, and it's related to Gamma functions by B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b). Also, for positive integers, Γ(m) = (m-1)!. \n\nSo, in this case, the integral in the problem is B(k+1, n - k + 1), which would be Γ(k+1)Γ(n - k + 1)/Γ(n + 2). Since Γ(k+1) = k! and Γ(n - k + 1) = (n - k)!, and Γ(n + 2) = (n + 1)!, substituting these in gives the Beta function as (k! (n - k)! ) / (n + 1)! ). \n\nMultiplying this by (n + 1) gives (n + 1) * (k! (n - k)! ) / (n + 1)! ) = (k! (n - k)! ) / n! ), which is exactly 1 / binomial(n, k). Therefore, the equation holds. \n\nAlternatively, using integration by parts might be another approach. Let's see if that works. Suppose we let u = x^k and dv = (1 - x)^{n - k} dx. Then du = k x^{k - 1} dx and v = - (1 - x)^{n - k + 1} / (n - k + 1). Applying integration by parts, the integral becomes uv evaluated from 0 to 1 minus the integral of v du. The boundary term uv would be zero because at x=1, (1 - x) term is zero, and at x=0, x^k is zero. So we're left with the integral part, which would involve k/(n - k + 1) times the integral of x^{k - 1} (1 - x)^{n - k + 1} dx. This seems recursive, so perhaps after applying integration by parts k times, we would end up with a factorial term in the denominator and the integral of (1 - x)^{n} dx, which is straightforward. This recursive application would lead to the same Beta function relation, hence confirming the result.\n\nAnother approach could be using the binomial theorem or probability. Since the integral is related to the expectation of a Beta distribution, maybe there's a probabilistic interpretation here. For instance, if we consider a Beta distribution with parameters k+1 and n - k + 1, the expected value might relate to the integral, but I need to check if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, generating functions might be useful. The generating function for binomial coefficients is (1 + x)^n. However, I'm not sure how to connect that directly to the integral given. \n\nWait, perhaps induction could work. Assume the formula holds for n and k, then show it for n+1 and k or k+1. But induction might get complicated here due to the dependencies between n and k.\n\nBack to the Beta function approach. Since the problem states 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the parameters of the Beta function are positive integers, so the relation to the Gamma function should hold without issues. Therefore, the integral evaluates to (k! (n - k)! ) / (n + 1)! ), and multiplying by (n + 1) gives 1 / binomial(n, k), which is the required inverse. \n\nTherefore, the key steps are recognizing the integral as a Beta function, relating it to Gamma functions, simplifying using factorials, and thus arriving at the desired identity. The original thought process might involve recalling these connections and verifying each step carefully.",
