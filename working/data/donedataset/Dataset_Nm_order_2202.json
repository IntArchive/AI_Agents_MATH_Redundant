    "Content": "I am trying to prove this interesting integral$$\n\\mathcal{I}:=\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\frac{dx}{{\\sin 2x}\\,(\\tan^ax+\\cot^ax)}=\\frac{\\pi}{8a},\\qquad \\mathcal{Re}(a)\\neq 0.\n$$\nThis result is breath taking but I am more stumped than usual.  It truly is magnificent.  I am not sure how to approach this,\nnote $\\sin 2x=2\\sin x \\cos x$.  I am not sure how to approach this because of the term\n$$\n(\\tan^ax+\\cot^ax)\n$$\nin the denominator.  I was trying to use the identity \n$$\n\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\right)=\\cot x\n$$\nsince this method solves a similar kind of integral but didn't get anywhere.    A bad idea I tried was to try and differentiate with respect to a\n$$\n\\frac{dI(a)}{da}=\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\partial_a \\left(\\frac{dx}{{\\sin 2x}\\,(\\tan^ax+\\cot^ax)}\\right)=\\int_0^{\\pi/4}  \\frac{(\\cot^a x \\log(\\cot x )+\\log(\\tan x ) \\tan^a x)}{\\sin 2x \\, (\\cot^a x+\\tan^a x)^2}dx\n$$\nwhich seems more complicated when I break it up into two integrals.  How can we solve the integral?  Thanks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving an integral equals π/(8a). The integral is from 0 to π/4, and the integrand is 1 divided by [sin2x times (tan^a x + cot^a x)]. The user mentions that Re(a) ≠ 0, so that's an assumption. The variable x is the integration variable, and the limits are from 0 to π/4. Also, the integrand involves sin2x, which they note is equal to 2 sinx cosx. \n\nSo the assumptions should list each condition. Let's see:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to π/4. So the interval of integration is [0, π/4].\n2. The integrand is 1/[sin2x*(tan^a x + cot^a x)]. So the integrand involves sin2x and the sum tan^a x + cot^a x.\n3. The real part of a is not zero (Re(a) ≠ 0). That's an assumption on the parameter a.\n4. The problem is to prove the integral equals π/(8a). \n\nWait, the example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the integral's limits, the form of the integrand, and the condition on a are all separate assumptions. But maybe the key assumptions here are the integral's bounds, the structure of the integrand, and the condition on a. Let me structure them properly.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/4].\n- The integrand is 1/[sin(2x)(tan^a x + cot^a x)].\n- The real part of a is non-zero (Re(a) ≠ 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals π/(8a).\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a separate condition. The problem is to prove the equality. The user's example included specific conditions on n, so similarly here, the conditions on the integral's limits, the integrand's form, and the parameter a's real part are each separate assumptions.",
