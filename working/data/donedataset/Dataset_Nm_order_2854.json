    "Content": "I have a symmetric matrix where all non-diagonal elements are positive and identical, and all diagonal elements are identical as well. For example, the $3 \\times 3$ version of this matrix has the following form: \n$$  \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n2a+b & a & a \\\\\na & 2a+b & a \\\\\na & a & 2a+b \\end{array} \\right)  $$ Note that $a>0\\ , b>0$. For such a simple form, is there an easy way of determining that the above matrix is positive definite in the general $n \\times n$ \n case? I'd like to show that the matrix is still positive definite when the dimension is higher. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Your matrix can be written as\n$$(a+b)I + a ee^T$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix and $e$ is the vector of ones. This is a sum of a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix and a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. Hence it is SPD.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user has a symmetric matrix where all the non-diagonal elements are the same positive number, and all the diagonal elements are identical too. They provided a 3x3 example where each diagonal entry is 2a + b and the off-diagonal entries are a, with a > 0 and b > 0. They want to know if this matrix is positive definite in the general n x n case and how to show that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a matrix positive definite. A symmetric matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive, or equivalently, if all the leading principal minors have positive determinants. Another approach is to check if the matrix can be written as a Gram matrix (i.e., using vectors that are linearly independent), or perhaps use some decomposition like Cholesky. But given the structure here, maybe there's a pattern in the eigenvalues.\n\nThe matrix in question is a combination of a scalar multiple of the matrix of ones plus a diagonal matrix. Let me think. Let's denote J as the n x n matrix where every entry is 1, and I as the identity matrix. Then, the given matrix can be written as a(J - I) + (a + b)I. Wait, let me check that. If each off-diagonal entry is a, then the off-diagonal part is a(J - I), because J has all ones, and subtracting the identity removes the diagonal. Then the diagonal entries in J - I are zero, so adding (a + b)I would set the diagonal entries to a + b. Wait, but in the example given, the diagonal entries are 2a + b. Hmm, maybe my initial decomposition is off.\n\nWait, in the 3x3 example, each diagonal entry is 2a + b. Let's see: if we consider that the matrix can be expressed as a(J) + (a + b)I. Because J is the matrix of ones, so multiplying by a gives a matrix with a on every entry. Then adding (a + b)I would add (a + b) to the diagonal entries. So the diagonal entries become a (from J) plus (a + b) from the identity, totaling 2a + b, which matches the example. The off-diagonal entries are just a from the J matrix. So yes, the matrix can be written as M = aJ + (a + b)I.\n\nNow, if that's the case, then maybe we can find the eigenvalues of M. Because J is a rank 1 matrix; its eigenvalues are n (with eigenvector the vector of ones) and 0 with multiplicity n - 1. Then, adding (a + b)I to aJ would shift the eigenvalues. Specifically, the eigenvalues of aJ would be a*n (from the rank 1 part) and 0 (with multiplicity n-1). Then adding (a + b)I would add (a + b) to each eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues of M would be a*n + (a + b) for the first eigenvalue, and 0 + (a + b) for the remaining n - 1 eigenvalues.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If J has eigenvalues n and 0 (with multiplicity n-1), then aJ has eigenvalues a*n and 0. Then adding (a + b)I would add (a + b) to each eigenvalue. So the eigenvalues of M = aJ + (a + b)I would be:\n\n- The first eigenvalue: a*n + (a + b) = a(n + 1) + b\n- The remaining n - 1 eigenvalues: 0 + (a + b) = a + b\n\nSo all eigenvalues of M are a(n + 1) + b and (a + b) repeated n - 1 times. Since a > 0 and b > 0, then a + b > 0. Also, a(n + 1) + b is positive because a, n, and b are all positive. Therefore, all eigenvalues are positive, so the matrix M is positive definite.\n\nWait, but in the example given for 3x3, n = 3. So the eigenvalues would be a*4 + b and (a + b) with multiplicity 2. Which are all positive as a and b are positive. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that in the 3x3 example, the diagonal entries are 2a + b. Let me check my decomposition again. If M = aJ + (a + b)I, then each diagonal entry is a*1 + (a + b) = 2a + b, which matches. The off-diagonal entries are a*1 + 0 = a, which also matches. So the decomposition is correct.\n\nTherefore, in general, for an n x n matrix, the eigenvalues are a(n) + (a + b) = a(n + 1) + b and (a + b) with multiplicity n - 1. Since a and b are positive, all these eigenvalues are positive. Therefore, the matrix is positive definite.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want another approach, perhaps using Sylvester's criterion (checking all leading principal minors are positive). But for a large n, calculating all those determinants would be tedious. The eigenvalue approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the matrix is positive definite for any n, given a > 0 and b > 0, because all eigenvalues are positive.",
