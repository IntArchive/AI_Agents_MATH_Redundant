    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that cos(2π/5) equals (-1 + √5)/4. The user wants the assumptions and problem statement formatted in a specific way.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is about a regular pentagon's apothem, which relates to the cosine of 2π/5. The key assumptions here would be the properties related to a regular pentagon and the angle involved. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the first assumption was that n is an integer, and the second that n is divisible by 7. Here, the main objects are the regular pentagon and the angle 2π/5. \n\nSo, the assumptions should probably include that we're dealing with a regular pentagon, and that the angle in question is 2π/5 radians. However, the problem statement itself is to prove the value of the cosine of this angle. The original question mentions wanting to find the apothem, but the problem they want to solve is proving the cosine value. So maybe the apothem part is context but not an assumption?\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem mentioned proving a number is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in the given example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; that was added as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted version added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. But in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was from another problem? Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake there, but I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to prove that cos(2π/5) equals (-1 + √5)/4. The original question mentions that this is needed to find the apothem of a regular pentagon. But the problem to structure is just the proof of the cosine value. So, what are the assumptions here? The problem is to prove this trigonometric identity. The assumptions would be the properties of a regular pentagon and the angle 2π/5. However, maybe the key assumption is that we're dealing with a regular pentagon, which implies that the central angles are 2π/5 radians. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The problem involves a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is 2π/5 radians.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the value of cosine for that angle. So maybe the main assumption is that we're working within the context of a regular pentagon, where the central angles are 2π/5. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is just that the angle is 2π/5, which is 72 degrees, a known angle in a regular pentagon.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is purely trigonometric, maybe the only assumption is that the angle 2π/5 is part of a unit circle or standard trigonometric definitions. But perhaps the problem requires using properties of a regular pentagon in the proof, so the assumption is that we're dealing with a regular pentagon's internal angles or central angles.\n\nWait, the user's example had assumptions that were perhaps more specific than the original problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was from a different problem where the divisibility by 7 was part of the assumptions? Perhaps there was a confusion in the example.\n\nBut regardless, I need to structure the current problem. The current problem is to prove that cos(2π/5) = (-1 + √5)/4. The original question mentions that this is needed for finding the apothem of a regular pentagon, but the problem to structure is just the proof of the cosine value. So, the assumptions here would be related to the properties of a regular pentagon and the angle in question.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted version added an assumption about n being an integer. So perhaps the assumption here is that the angle is 2π/5, which is the central angle of a regular pentagon. So possible assumptions:\n\n- The angle 2π/5 is considered.\n- The problem relates to a regular pentagon.\n\nBut maybe the key is that in the problem statement, the angle 2π/5 is given, so the assumption is that we need to prove the cosine of that specific angle. However, since the problem is to prove the value, maybe the only assumption is the angle itself. But the example included multiple assumptions. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove this identity either geometrically or trigonometrically, as per the original question. So perhaps the assumptions are about the methods allowed? But the user's format requires assumptions about the problem's conditions, not the methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the angle being 2π/5, but the problem is to compute its cosine. However, in the example, the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, which might be part of the problem's conditions. But in the current problem, there are no such conditions; it's a pure trigonometric identity. So maybe the only assumption is that the angle is 2π/5 radians. But the user's example added an assumption even when the original problem didn't state it. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that the angle is 2π/5, which is given in the problem statement. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the angle being 2π/5, so the assumption is simply that θ = 2π/5. But the user's example had two assumptions. Maybe in this case, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\n- θ = 2π/5 radians.\n\nProblem: Prove that cos θ = (-1 + √5)/4.\n\nAlternatively, considering the context of a regular pentagon, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The figure is a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is a central angle of the regular pentagon.\n\nBut in a regular pentagon, each central angle is indeed 2π/5, so that's a valid assumption. Therefore, structuring the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The problem involves a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is a central angle of the regular pentagon.\n\nProblem: Prove that cos(2π/5) = (-1 + √5)/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one assumption: The angle 2π/5 is a central angle of a regular pentagon.\n\nBut I need to follow the example's structure, which splits each assumption into separate lines. However, in the example, the original problem didn't have the second assumption (n divisible by 7), which makes me think that perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, the user wants to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original question. In the original question here, the user wants to prove the cosine value, possibly using geometric or trigonometric methods, related to a regular pentagon. So the key assumptions are that the angle is 2π/5 and that it's related to a regular pentagon.\n\nSo, to follow the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- The problem involves a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is 2π/5 radians.\n\nProblem: Prove that cos(2π/5) = (−1 + √5)/4.\n\nAlternatively, since the angle 2π/5 is inherent to a regular pentagon, maybe just state that the regular pentagon is considered, and the angle is a central angle. But perhaps the user wants the most concise assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"I would like to find the apothem of a regular pentagon. It follows from cos(2π/5) = (−1 + √5)/4. But how can this be proved (geometrically or trigonometrically)?\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that cos(2π/5) equals that value, which is needed for the apothem. So the assumptions would be that we are dealing with a regular pentagon, and that the angle in question is 2π/5, which is a central angle. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The figure is a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is 2π/5 radians.\n\nProblem: Prove that cos(2π/5) = (−1 + √5)/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just one assumption: The angle 2π/5 is a central angle of a regular pentagon. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So \"the figure is a regular pentagon\" is one assumption about the object (the pentagon). \"The angle considered is 2π/5 radians\" is another assumption about the angle. That seems to fit the format.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The figure is a regular pentagon.\n- The angle considered is 2π/5 radians.\n\nProblem: Prove that cos(2π/5) = (−1 + √5)/4.\n\nBut let me check if the angle 2π/5 being considered is already implied by the regular pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the central angles are indeed 2π/5, so maybe the first assumption (regular pentagon) implies the second. However, the user's example listed both the general condition (n is integer) and a specific one (n divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't state the latter. So perhaps in this case, the angle is part of the problem's statement, and the regular pentagon is the context. Therefore, the assumptions are the regular pentagon and the specific angle.\n\nI think this makes sense. So the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- The figure is a regular pentagon,\n- The angle considered is $\\frac{2\\pi}{5}$ radians.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\cos \\frac{2\\pi }{5}=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$\n###",
