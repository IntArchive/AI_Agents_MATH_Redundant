    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that all roots of the polynomial P(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_n z^n lie within the unit disc, given that the coefficients satisfy 0 < a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some theorems related to polynomial roots and their locations. The user mentioned Rouche's theorem but said it didn't work with their initial approach. Let me think about why that might be. Rouche's theorem states that if |f(z)| > |g(z)| on some contour, then f and f + g have the same number of zeros inside the contour. They tried taking f(z) = a_n z^n and g(z) as the rest of the polynomial. But maybe on the unit circle |z|=1, |g(z)| isn't necessarily less than |f(z)|. Let's check that.\n\nIf we take z on the unit circle, so |z| = 1. Then |f(z)| = |a_n z^n| = a_n. The rest of the polynomial g(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_{n-1} z^{n-1}. The maximum modulus of g(z) on |z|=1 would be the sum of the coefficients: |g(z)| ≤ a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{n-1}. Since the coefficients are increasing, a_0 + ... + a_{n-1} is less than n a_{n-1}. But since a_{n-1} < a_n, the sum is less than n a_{n-1} < n a_n. But unless n is 1, this sum could be larger than a_n. For example, if n=2, then |g(z)| ≤ a_0 + a_1 < a_1 + a_1 = 2 a_1. But a_1 < a_2, so 2 a_1 could be more or less than a_2. If a_2 > 2 a_1, then |f(z)| = a_2 > |g(z)|, so Rouche applies. But if a_2 ≤ 2 a_1, then maybe not. So this approach might not work in general.\n\nSo maybe Rouche isn't the way to go here. Another idea is to use the reciprocal polynomial. Let me consider Q(z) = z^n P(1/z). Then Q(z) = a_0 z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + ... + a_n. The roots of Q(z) are the reciprocals of the roots of P(z). If we can show that all roots of Q(z) lie outside the unit disc, then all roots of P(z) lie inside. \n\nBut how to show that Q(z) has all roots outside |z| > 1? Maybe apply the Cauchy bound or other bounds on roots. Alternatively, consider using the Schur theorem or other criteria.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the argument principle or maybe a transformation. Another approach is to use the fact that if the coefficients are increasing, the polynomial might have a certain property. For example, consider the polynomial P(z) - a_n z^n = a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_{n-1} z^{n-1}. If we can bound this on |z|=1, maybe show that |P(z)| > |a_n z^n| on |z|=1, which would imply by Rouche that all roots are inside. But wait, if |a_n z^n| > |P(z) - a_n z^n| on |z|=1, then P(z) has n roots inside, which is the degree. But the problem is that the sum of the lower coefficients might exceed a_n. For example, if all a_j =1, then the sum would be n, but a_n =1. So for n >1, sum is greater. But in our case, coefficients are increasing. So a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{n-1} < n a_{n-1} < n a_n. But unless n a_{n-1} < a_n, which would require a_n > n a_{n-1}, but the given condition is a_{n-1} < a_n. So unless a_n is sufficiently larger than a_{n-1}, this might not hold. So maybe this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nAnother thought: maybe use the Eneström–Kakeya theorem, which relates to polynomials with positive increasing coefficients. Wait, yes! That theorem states that if a polynomial has coefficients 0 < a_0 ≤ a_1 ≤ ... ≤ a_n, then all its roots lie in the annulus r ≤ |z| ≤ R, where r = min_{k} a_{k-1}/a_k and R = max_{k} a_{k}/a_{k-1}. Wait, but in our case, the coefficients are increasing, so a_{k}/a_{k-1} ≥1, so the upper bound would be the maximum of these ratios. But maybe this gives that all roots lie in |z| ≤ max_{k} a_k/a_{k-1}. But if the coefficients are strictly increasing, then maybe this can be tightened. Wait, the Eneström–Kakeya theorem actually states that all roots lie in |z| ≤ 1. Wait, let me check the exact statement.\n\nLooking up Eneström–Kakeya theorem: If a polynomial P(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_n z^n has real positive coefficients with 0 < a_0 ≤ a_1 ≤ ... ≤ a_n, then all its roots lie in the annulus r ≤ |z| ≤ R where r = min_{1 ≤ k ≤ n} a_{k-1}/a_k and R = max_{1 ≤ k ≤ n} a_{k}/a_{k-1}. \n\nBut in our case, since coefficients are increasing, a_{k}/a_{k-1} ≥1 for all k. Therefore, R = max a_{k}/a_{k-1} ≥1, so roots lie in |z| ≤ R. But we need to show they lie in |z| ≤1. Therefore, unless R ≤1, which would require all a_k ≤ a_{k-1}, which contradicts the increasing coefficients. So this theorem doesn't directly give the desired result. Therefore, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the transformation w = z - 1 or something else. Or perhaps use a substitution to relate to a known polynomial. \n\nAnother idea: consider evaluating the polynomial on |z|=1. If we can show that P(z) ≠0 for |z| ≥1, then all roots must lie inside. So assume |z| ≥1 and show P(z) ≠0. \n\nLet’s suppose |z| ≥1 and P(z) =0. Then, \n\na_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_n z^n =0 \n\n=> a_n z^n = - (a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_{n-1} z^{n-1})\n\nTaking absolute values:\n\n|a_n z^n| = |a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_{n-1} z^{n-1}| \n\nBut |a_n z^n| = a_n |z|^n ≥ a_n (since |z| ≥1)\n\nOn the other hand, |a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_{n-1} z^{n-1}| ≤ a_0 + a_1 |z| + ... + a_{n-1} |z|^{n-1}\n\nSince |z| ≥1, each |z|^k ≤ |z|^{n-1} for k ≤n-1. Therefore:\n\nSum ≤ (a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{n-1}) |z|^{n-1}\n\nBut since coefficients are increasing, a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{n-1} < a_n, so the sum a_0 + ... +a_{n-1} < n a_{n-1}\n\nThus:\n\n|RHS| < n a_{n-1} |z|^{n-1}\n\nBut from the left side, |a_n z^n| ≥ a_n |z|^n\n\nSo combining:\n\na_n |z|^n ≤ n a_{n-1} |z|^{n-1}\n\nDivide both sides by |z|^{n-1} (since |z| ≥1, this is allowed):\n\na_n |z| ≤ n a_{n-1}\n\nBut since |z| ≥1, this implies:\n\na_n ≤ n a_{n-1}\n\nBut wait, this is a contradiction because given that a_n > a_{n-1}, but unless n=1, a_n ≤n a_{n-1} could hold or not. For example, if a_n =2 a_{n-1} and n=2, then 2 a_{n-1} ≤2 a_{n-1}, which holds. But if a_n is greater than n a_{n-1}, then it's a contradiction. However, in the given problem, we only have a_n >a_{n-1}, but no specific relation to n. So this approach might not yield a contradiction in all cases.\n\nWait, but if we proceed, from a_n |z| ≤n a_{n-1}, then |z| ≤ (n a_{n-1})/a_n. Since we assume |z| ≥1, then this requires (n a_{n-1})/a_n ≥1, i.e., a_n ≤n a_{n-1}. However, if a_n >n a_{n-1}, then this inequality would give |z| ≤ something <1, contradicting |z| ≥1. Therefore, in that case, there's no solution, so all roots must lie inside |z|<1. But if a_n ≤n a_{n-1}, then this doesn't give a contradiction, so maybe there are roots on or outside the unit circle.\n\nBut the problem states that coefficients are strictly increasing, 0 <a_0 <a_1 <... <a_n. The user wants to show all roots are inside the unit disc. However, this approach only gives a contradiction if a_n >n a_{n-1}. So perhaps this method is insufficient.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the case when z is a root with |z| ≥1. Then,\n\nP(z)=0 => a_n z^n = - (a_0 +a_1 z + ... +a_{n-1} z^{n-1})\n\nDivide both sides by z^n:\n\na_n = - (a_0 z^{-n} + a_1 z^{-n+1} + ... +a_{n-1} z^{-1})\n\nTaking absolute values:\n\n|a_n| = |a_0 z^{-n} + ... +a_{n-1} z^{-1}| ≤ a_0 |z|^{-n} + ... +a_{n-1} |z|^{-1}\n\nSince |z| ≥1, each |z|^{-k} ≤1, so the sum is ≤ a_0 +a_1 + ... +a_{n-1}\n\nBut since coefficients are increasing, a_0 <a_1 <...<a_n, so sum a_0 +...+a_{n-1} <n a_{n-1}\n\nThus, |a_n| <n a_{n-1}\n\nBut a_n >a_{n-1}, so this gives a_n <n a_{n-1}\n\nBut this is not necessarily a contradiction unless we have a_n ≥n a_{n-1}\n\nTherefore, this approach shows that if there is a root with |z| ≥1, then a_n <n a_{n-1}\n\nBut the problem does not assume a_n ≥n a_{n-1}; it only assumes a_n >a_{n-1}\n\nThus, this reasoning does not lead to a contradiction in all cases. Hence, the previous approach is insufficient.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe use the Schur test. Schur's theorem says that if the coefficients of a polynomial are sufficiently dominant, then all roots lie inside the unit disc. Alternatively, consider applying the theorem that if for a polynomial P(z), the coefficient a_k satisfy a_k > sum_{j≠k} |a_j|, then all roots lie inside the unit disc. But in our case, the leading coefficient is a_n, but we need to check if a_n > sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j. But given that coefficients are increasing, sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j <n a_{n-1}. If a_n >n a_{n-1}, then yes, but if not, then no. So this only applies when a_n >n a_{n-1}, which is not given.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the reciprocal polynomial. Let Q(z)=z^n P(1/z)=a_0 z^n +a_1 z^{n-1} +...+a_n. If we can show that Q(z) has all roots inside |z|<1, then P(z) has all roots outside, but we need the opposite. Wait, no: roots of Q(z) are 1/z_i where z_i are roots of P(z). So if Q(z) has all roots inside |z|<1, then P(z) has all roots outside |z|>1. But we need the reverse. So maybe if we can show Q(z) has all roots outside |z|≥1, then P(z) has all roots inside. But how?\n\nAlternatively, use the Gauss-Lucas theorem, which states that the roots of the derivative lie within the convex hull of the roots of the polynomial. Not sure if helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: Consider using the argument principle. The number of zeros inside |z|<1 can be found by integrating P’(z)/P(z) around the unit circle. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, let's try an example. Take a simple case where coefficients are increasing. For example, P(z)=1+2z+3z^2. Does this have all roots inside the unit disc? Let's compute roots: 3z² +2z +1=0. The roots are [-2 ± sqrt(4-12)]/6 = [-2 ± sqrt(-8)]/6 = (-2 ± 2i√2)/6 = (-1 ± i√2)/3. The modulus is sqrt( (1/3)^2 + (√2/3)^2 )=sqrt(1+2)/3= sqrt(3)/3 ≈0.577 <1. So yes, roots inside. Another example: P(z)=1+2z+4z^2. Roots of 4z² +2z +1=0: [-2 ± sqrt(4-16)]/8 = [-2 ± sqrt(-12)]/8 = (-2 ± 2i√3)/8 = (-1 ± i√3)/4. Modulus sqrt(1/16 +3/16)=sqrt(4/16)=0.5 <1. Another example with larger coefficients: P(z)=1+2z+3z^2+4z^3. Let's compute roots numerically. But maybe hard. Alternatively, use the criterion.\n\nWait, in the examples above, the roots are inside the unit disc. Maybe the theorem is true. But how to prove it?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Suppose we consider the polynomial P(z) = a_0 +a_1 z +...+a_n z^n with 0 <a_0 <a_1 <...<a_n. Let’s consider Q(z) = (1-z)P(z) = a_0 (1-z) +a_1 z(1-z) +...+a_n z^n (1-z). Expanding this might give some telescoping terms, but not sure. Alternatively, consider evaluating P(z) on |z|=1.\n\nLet’s assume |z|=1 and z ≠1. Then, P(z) = sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^k. Let's compare this to the polynomial with all coefficients equal to a_n: sum_{k=0}^n a_n z^k = a_n (1 - z^{n+1})/(1 - z). Then, the difference between P(z) and this polynomial is sum_{k=0}^n (a_k -a_n) z^k. But since a_k <a_n for all k <n, this difference would have negative coefficients. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing P(z) = a_n z^n + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k z^k. Since a_k <a_n, perhaps factor out a_n z^n: P(z) =a_n z^n (1 + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (a_k /a_n) z^{k -n}). Let’s set w =1/z. Then, P(z) = a_n w^{-n} (1 + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (a_k /a_n) w^{n -k}). Let’s denote m =n -k, so m runs from 1 to n. Then, sum becomes sum_{m=1}^n (a_{n -m}/a_n) w^m. So P(z) =a_n w^{-n} (1 + sum_{m=1}^n (a_{n -m}/a_n) w^m). Let’s call this Q(w)=1 + sum_{m=1}^n (a_{n -m}/a_n) w^m. Then, if Q(w)=0, then P(z)=0 when w=1/z. So roots of P(z) correspond to roots of Q(w) via w=1/z. If we can show that all roots of Q(w) satisfy |w| >1, then all roots of P(z) satisfy |z|=1/|w| <1. \n\nSo now, Q(w)=1 + sum_{m=1}^n (a_{n -m}/a_n) w^m. Let’s denote b_m =a_{n -m}/a_n for m=1,…,n. Since a_{n -m} <a_n (because coefficients are increasing), we have b_m <1 for all m. So Q(w)=1 + sum_{m=1}^n b_m w^m with 0 <b_m <1. Now, we need to show that all roots of Q(w) lie in |w| >1. \n\nIs there a theorem that applies here? Yes, there is a result that if a polynomial has coefficients c_0 +c_1 w +...+c_n w^n with c_0=1 and |c_m| <1 for all m, then all roots lie outside the unit disc. Wait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, 1 +0.5w +0.5w^2. The roots are at w= [-0.5 ± sqrt(0.25 -2)]/1, which are complex with modulus sqrt(|roots|^2). Wait, let's compute: discriminant is 0.25 - 2*1*0.5 =0.25 -1= -0.75. So roots are (-0.5 ±i√0.75)/1, modulus sqrt(0.25 +0.75)=sqrt(1)=1. So modulus is1. Hmm. So maybe this requires more precise conditions.\n\nAlternatively, consider applying the Cauchy bound. The Cauchy bound says that all roots w satisfy |w| ≤1 + max_{1≤m≤n} |b_m|. But since b_m <1, this gives |w| ≤2. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Use the reciprocal again. Let’s consider w^n Q(1/w) =w^n + sum_{m=1}^n b_m w^{n -m} =w^n + b_1 w^{n-1} + ... +b_n. If we can show that this polynomial has all roots inside |w|<1, then Q(w) has all roots outside |w|>1. But the polynomial w^n + b_1 w^{n-1} + ... +b_n has coefficients 0 <b_i <1. But how to analyze its roots?\n\nAlternatively, use Rouche's theorem for Q(w). On |w|=1, |sum_{m=1}^n b_m w^m| ≤ sum_{m=1}^n b_m <n*1 =n. But |1|=1. So unless sum b_m <1, we can't apply Rouche. But since sum b_m = sum a_{n -m}/a_n from m=1 to n. That is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k /a_n. Since coefficients are increasing, a_k <a_n for all k <n. So sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k <n a_{n-1} <n a_n. Therefore, sum b_m = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k /a_n <n a_{n-1}/a_n <n (since a_{n-1} <a_n). So sum b_m <n. But for Rouche, we need |sum b_m w^m| <1 on |w|=1. But this is only true if sum b_m <1, which is not necessarily the case. For example, if n=2, a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=3. Then sum b_m = (a_0 +a_1)/a_2 =3/3=1. So in this case, sum b_m=1. So |sum b_m w^m| ≤1. But equality could occur. So Rouche might not apply.\n\nWait, in the example above, sum b_m=1, so |sum b_m w^m| ≤1, and |1|=1. So on |w|=1, |Q(w)| ≥ |1| - |sum b_m w^m| ≥0. So Q(w) could have zeros on |w|=1. But in reality, when we tested specific polynomials, the roots were inside. So perhaps this approach isn't capturing it.\n\nAlternative approach: Use the fact that the polynomial P(z) has a decreasing argument when traversing the unit circle. Or consider using the Schur-Cohn test, which gives conditions for all roots to lie inside the unit disc. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, recall that if a polynomial P(z) satisfies |P(z)| > |Q(z)| on |z|=1, then by Rouche, P(z) and P(z)-Q(z) have the same number of zeros inside. Wait, maybe another way: consider the polynomial P(z) and compare it to a_n z^n. If on |z|=1, |a_n z^n| > |sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k z^k|, then all roots are inside. But as before, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k <n a_{n-1}. So |sum| ≤n a_{n-1}. We need a_n >n a_{n-1}. But in general, this isn't given. The problem only states a_n >a_{n-1}, not a_n >n a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the examples I took earlier, like P(z)=1+2z+3z^2, sum of lower coefficients is 1+2=3, and a_n=3. So sum=3, a_n=3. So in this case, equality. So |sum|=3=|a_n z^n|=3. So on |z|=1, |P(z)|=|3z^2 +2z +1| ≥ |3z^2| - |2z +1| ≥3 - (2+1)=0. But equality might occur at certain points. So Rouche doesn't apply here. But in reality, roots are inside. So another method is needed.\n\nAnother idea: Let's use the fact that for |z|=1, P(z) ≠0. Assume |z|=1 and P(z)=0. Then,\n\nsum_{k=0}^n a_k z^k =0\n\nMultiply both sides by z^{-n}:\n\nsum_{k=0}^n a_k z^{k -n} =0 => sum_{k=0}^n a_k z^{- (n -k)} =0\n\nLet’s let m =n -k, so sum_{m=0}^n a_{n -m} z^{-m} =0. So,\n\na_n + a_{n-1} z^{-1} + ... +a_0 z^{-n} =0\n\nMultiply both sides by z^n:\n\na_n z^n +a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + ... +a_0 =0\n\nBut this is the same as the original polynomial reversed. Wait, but this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider taking the conjugate:\n\nsum_{k=0}^n a_k \\overline{z}^k =0, since |z|=1 implies \\overline{z}=1/z.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing z=e^{iθ} and analyze the real and imaginary parts. But this might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, consider the real part of P(z). For |z|=1, write z=e^{iθ}, then P(z)=sum_{k=0}^n a_k e^{ikθ}. Suppose P(z)=0, then both real and imaginary parts are zero.\n\nBut not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the fact that if all coefficients are positive and increasing, then the polynomial is \"self-reciprocal\" in some sense? Not exactly, but perhaps use a substitution.\n\nWait, here's a different idea. Consider the polynomial P(z) -a_n z^n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k z^k. If we can show that on |z|=1, |P(z) -a_n z^n| < |a_n z^n|, then by Rouche, P(z) has n roots inside, same as a_n z^n. But as discussed before, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k <n a_{n-1} <n a_n. So |sum| <n a_{n-1} <n a_n. But |a_n z^n|=a_n. So to have sum <a_n, we need n a_{n-1} <a_n. But the problem doesn't specify this. So this approach only works if a_n >n a_{n-1}, which isn't given.\n\nBut the problem states that coefficients are strictly increasing: a_0 <a_1 <...<a_n. So a_{k} -a_{k-1} >0 for all k.\n\nWait, perhaps use induction. Suppose the result holds for degree n-1, then show for degree n. But I don't see the inductive step.\n\nAlternatively, consider the derivative. If we can show that the derivative has roots inside the unit disc, then by Gauss-Lucas, the original polynomial does too. But not helpful unless we know something about the derivative.\n\nAnother thought: Use the transformation w=z-1. Let’s set w=z-1, so z=w+1. Then P(z) becomes a polynomial in w. Maybe the transformation makes the polynomial have all coefficients positive, and apply a known result. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial Q(z)=P(z)/z^n =a_0 z^{-n} +a_1 z^{-n+1} +...+a_n. Then, Q(z)=0 implies P(z)=0. If we set w=1/z, then Q(z)=a_0 w^n +a_1 w^{n-1} +...+a_n=0. So the equation becomes sum_{k=0}^n a_k w^{n-k}=0. Let's denote m=n-k, so sum_{m=0}^n a_{n-m} w^m=0. So this is similar to the reciprocal polynomial. Let’s call this R(w)=sum_{m=0}^n a_{n-m} w^m. We need to show that all roots of R(w) lie outside |w|>1, i.e., |w|>1. Then, z=1/w would have |z|<1.\n\nBut how to show R(w) has all roots outside |w|>1. Let’s apply the criterion that if a polynomial has coefficients a_0 ≤a_1 ≤...≤a_n, then all roots lie in |w| ≤1. But this is the opposite of what we need. Wait, but R(w) has coefficients a_n, a_{n-1},...,a_0 which are decreasing: a_n >a_{n-1} >...>a_0 >0. \n\nThere's a theorem that if a polynomial has positive decreasing coefficients, then all its roots lie outside the unit disc. Is that true? Let's check with an example. Take R(w)=3w² +2w +1. This has roots (-2 ±sqrt(4-12))/6 = complex as before. The roots are inside |w|=1. But R(w) has decreasing coefficients. Wait, this contradicts the supposed theorem. So that can't be. Therefore, the theorem must be different.\n\nWait, but in our example, R(w)=3w² +2w +1, which is the same as P(z)=1+2z+3z². Its roots are inside |z|<1, so R(w)=P(1/w)w²=3w² +2w +1 has roots at w=1/z, which are outside |w|>1. Wait, yes! Because if P(z) has roots inside |z|<1, then R(w)=P(1/w)w^n has roots at w=1/z, which are outside |w|>1. So in this case, R(w)=3w² +2w +1 has roots at w=1/z, where z are roots of P(z). Since z are inside |z|<1, w are outside |w|>1. Therefore, R(w) has all roots outside |w|>1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to showing that R(w)=a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_0 w^n has all roots outside |w|≥1. Because once we show that, then z=1/w would be inside |z|≤1. \n\nNow, how to show that R(w) has all roots in |w|>1. Let's try applying the reciprocal of the earlier approach. Suppose |w|≤1, then R(w)≠0. Assume |w|≤1 and R(w)=0. Then,\n\na_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_0 w^n =0\n\nRearranged:\n\na_0 w^n = - (a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_1 w^{n-1})\n\nTake absolute values:\n\n|a_0 w^n| = |a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_1 w^{n-1}| \n\nLeft side: |a_0 w^n| ≤a_0 |w|^n ≤a_0 (since |w| ≤1)\n\nRight side: |a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_1 w^{n-1}| ≥|a_n| - |a_{n-1}w +...+a_1 w^{n-1}| \n\n≥a_n - (a_{n-1}|w| +...+a_1 |w|^{n-1})\n\nSince |w| ≤1, this is ≥a_n - (a_{n-1} +...+a_1)\n\nBut since coefficients are increasing, a_1 <a_2 <...<a_{n-1} <a_n. So sum a_1 +...+a_{n-1} <(n-1)a_{n-1} <(n-1)a_n. Therefore,\n\nRight side ≥a_n - (n-1)a_{n-1}\n\nBut since a_{n-1} <a_n, we have (n-1)a_{n-1} <(n-1)a_n. Thus,\n\nRight side >a_n - (n-1)a_n =a_n (1 -(n-1))=a_n (2 -n)\n\nIf n ≥2, this becomes a_n (2 -n). For n=2, it's 0. For n≥3, it's negative. But the left side is ≤a_0 <a_n. So if the right side is positive, then we have a contradiction. When is the right side positive?\n\nRight side >a_n - (n-1)a_{n-1} \n\nWe need a_n - (n-1)a_{n-1} >0 =>a_n >(n-1)a_{n-1}\n\nBut the problem only states a_n >a_{n-1}, not a_n >(n-1)a_{n-1}. So this would only hold if a_n is sufficiently large compared to a_{n-1}.\n\nFor example, if n=2, then right side >a_2 -a_1. Since a_2 >a_1, it's positive. So for n=2, the right side is >a_2 -a_1, which is positive. So for n=2:\n\nLeft side ≤a_0 <a_1 <a_2\n\nRight side >a_2 -a_1\n\nThus, combining:\n\na_0 ≥a_2 -a_1 ?\n\nBut since a_0 <a_1 <a_2, then a_2 -a_1 <a_2 -a_0. But not sure.\n\nWait, for n=2, assume R(w)=a_0 w² +a_1 w +a_2=0. Suppose |w|≤1. Then,\n\n|a_0 w² +a_1 w| =|a_2|\n\nBut |a_0 w² +a_1 w| ≤a_0 |w|² +a_1 |w| ≤a_0 +a_1 <a_1 +a_1=2a_1 (since a_0 <a_1). But a_2 >a_1, so 2a_1 could be less or greater than a_2. For example, if a_2=3, a_1=2, a_0=1, then 2a_1=4 >a_2=3. So in this case, |LHS| ≤1+2=3 <3= |RHS|, which would be impossible. Wait, but this example R(w)=w² +2w +3=0. Roots are (-2 ±sqrt(4-12))/2=(-2 ±i√8)/2= -1 ±i√2. The modulus is sqrt(1 +2)=√3≈1.732 >1. So roots are outside |w|=1. \n\nBut according to the previous inequality, |LHS| ≤3, |RHS|=3. The equality is possible. So when |w|=1, can we have |a_0 w² +a_1 w|=a_2?\n\nIn this example, a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=3. Suppose |w|=1. Then |w² +2w|=|w(w +2)|=|w +2|. Since |w|=1, |w +2| ≥|2| - |w|=1. The maximum is 3 when w=1. So |w +2| ranges from 1 to3. So |w² +2w|=|w +2| can reach 3 when w=1. At w=1, R(w)=1 +2 +3=6 ≠0. So equality is not achieved. Therefore, in this case, R(w) ≠0 on |w|≤1. Hence, roots are outside.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nThe key idea is that for |w|≤1, the magnitude of the lower terms (a_0 w^n + ... +a_{n-1} w) is strictly less than a_n, hence R(w) cannot be zero.\n\nBut earlier calculations showed that for general n, |a_0 w^n + ... +a_{n-1} w| ≤a_0 + ... +a_{n-1} <n a_{n-1} <n a_n. But to have this sum <a_n, we need n a_{n-1} <a_n, which isn't given. However, in the specific case of n=2, even though n a_{n-1}=2a_1 may be greater than a_2, the actual maximum of |LHS| on |w|=1 is less than a_2. For example, in the example above, sum a_0 +a_1=3 <a_2=3 (equality), but the actual maximum of |LHS| is 3 when w=1, but R(w)=6≠0. So the maximum is not achieved at the same point where R(w)=0.\n\nThis suggests that even if the sum of coefficients is equal to a_n, the maximum of |LHS| on |w|=1 is achieved at a different point where R(w)≠0.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there's a different way to bound |a_0 w^n + ... +a_{n-1} w|.\n\nLet’s consider for |w|≤1:\n\n|a_0 w^n +a_1 w^{n-1} +... +a_{n-1} w| ≤a_0 |w|^n +a_1 |w|^{n-1} +... +a_{n-1} |w|\n\nSince |w|≤1, each term |w|^k ≤|w| for k≥1. Therefore,\n\nSum ≤a_0 |w| +a_1 |w| +... +a_{n-1} |w| =|w| (a_0 +a_1 +... +a_{n-1})\n\nBut since coefficients are increasing, a_0 +a_1 +... +a_{n-1} <n a_{n-1}\n\nThus,\n\nSum <|w| n a_{n-1} ≤n a_{n-1} (since |w| ≤1)\n\nBut R(w)=0 implies a_n = -(a_0 w^n +... +a_{n-1} w)/w^0. Wait, no, R(w)=a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_0 w^n=0 => a_n = -(a_{n-1}w +... +a_0 w^n)\n\nSo |a_n|=|a_{n-1}w +... +a_0 w^n| ≤a_{n-1}|w| +... +a_0 |w|^n. As before, since |w| ≤1, this sum ≤a_{n-1} +... +a_0 <n a_{n-1}\n\nBut a_n >a_{n-1}, so |a_n| ≥a_n >a_{n-1}\n\nThus, we have a_{n-1} <a_n ≤n a_{n-1}\n\nThis is only possible if n ≥2 and a_n ≤n a_{n-1}\n\nBut this doesn't lead to a contradiction unless a_n >n a_{n-1}, which is not given.\n\nHowever, in the example with n=2, a_2=3, a_1=2, we have a_2=3 <2 a_1=4. So the inequality a_n ≤n a_{n-1} holds. But in reality, the roots are still outside. So this approach isn't yielding a contradiction, but empirically, the roots are outside.\n\nThis suggests that a different method is needed. Perhaps using the argument principle or a different theorem.\n\nWait, here's a different idea: Consider the polynomial R(w)=a_n +a_{n-1}w +... +a_0 w^n. Let’s evaluate R(w) at w=1: R(1)=a_n +a_{n-1} +... +a_0. Since coefficients are positive, R(1)>0. Similarly, R(w) evaluated at w= real numbers between 0 and1 is positive. But this doesn't help for complex roots.\n\nAlternatively, consider the case when w is real and 0 <w ≤1. Then R(w)=a_n +a_{n-1}w +... +a_0 w^n >a_n +a_{n-1}w +... +a_0 w^n >a_n >0. Similarly, for real w ≥1, R(w) is increasing since coefficients are positive. Thus, R(w) has no real roots in 0 <w ≤1. But this doesn’t address complex roots.\n\nAnother approach: Use the fact that all coefficients of R(w) are positive and decreasing. There's a theorem that states that such polynomials have all roots in the left half-plane (negative real parts). But this doesn't directly relate to modulus.\n\nWait, perhaps use the following result: If all coefficients of a polynomial are positive and decreasing, then all roots have negative real parts. This is similar to the result for polynomials with positive coefficients. But does this help? If all roots have negative real parts, does that imply they are outside the unit disc? Not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the Cauchy bound for R(w). The Cauchy bound says that all roots w satisfy |w| ≤1 + max_{k <n} |a_k /a_0|^{1/(n -k)}. But since a_k <a_n for k <n, this might give a bound greater than1.\n\nAlternatively, use the bound that for a polynomial with positive coefficients, all roots lie in the annulus r ≤|w| ≤R where r=min a_k /a_{k+1}, R=max a_k /a_{k+1}. But for R(w), which has coefficients a_n, a_{n-1},...,a_0, which are decreasing. So applying Eneström–Kakeya theorem to R(w): since coefficients are decreasing, the roots lie in |w| ≤ max_{k} a_{k}/a_{k+1} (since coefficients are a_n, a_{n-1},...,a_0). Wait, but Eneström–Kakeya for decreasing coefficients would give that all roots lie in |w| ≤1. But in our example, R(w)=3 +2w +w² has roots with |w|=√3>1. So this can't be. Therefore, the theorem must have different conditions.\n\nAfter checking, the Eneström–Kakeya theorem actually states that for a polynomial with positive coefficients a_0 ≥a_1 ≥...≥a_n >0, all roots lie in the annulus min(a_k/a_{k+1}) ≤|z| ≤max(a_k/a_{k+1}). So for R(w) with coefficients a_n ≥a_{n-1} ≥...≥a_0 >0, the roots lie in the annulus min(a_k/a_{k+1}) ≤|z| ≤max(a_k/a_{k+1}). Since coefficients are decreasing, a_k/a_{k+1} ≥1 for all k. Therefore, the lower bound is ≥1 and upper bound is also ≥1. Therefore, all roots lie in |z| ≥1. Exactly! \n\nYes, the Eneström–Kakeya theorem for polynomials with positive decreasing coefficients states that all roots lie in |z| ≥1. Therefore, applying this theorem to R(w)=a_n +a_{n-1}w +...+a_0 w^n, which has decreasing coefficients, gives that all roots satisfy |w| ≥1. Moreover, since coefficients are strictly decreasing, the roots cannot lie on |w|=1, so they must be strictly outside. Hence, all roots of R(w) are in |w|>1, implying all roots of P(z) are in |z|<1.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by applying the Eneström–Kakeya theorem to the reciprocal polynomial R(w). Hence, the answer is to cite this theorem.\n\nBut since the user might not know this theorem, the solution would involve explaining this approach. However, in the formatted problem, we only need to list the assumptions and the problem. The original question is about showing roots live in the unit disc given coefficients 0 <a_0 <a_1 <...<a_n. The assumptions are the conditions given: the polynomial has coefficients strictly increasing from a_0 to a_n, all positive.",
