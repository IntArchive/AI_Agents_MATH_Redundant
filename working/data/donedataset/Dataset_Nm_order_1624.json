    "Content": "Assume: $p$ is a prime that satisfies $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ Show: $x^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ has no solutions $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. I know this problem has something to do with Fermat's Little Theorem, that $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1\\pmod p$. I tried to do a proof by contradiction, assuming the conclusion and showing some contradiction but just ran into a wall. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $x^2\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$ . Then $x^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$ . Since $p = 4k+3$ , we have $$x^{p-1} = x^{4k+2} = x^2x^{4k} \\equiv -1(x^4)^k\\equiv -1\\pmod{p},$$ which contradicts Fermat's Little Theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and filter out any unrelated information.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Prove that $x^{2} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ has no solutions if prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\" The question body restates the assumption that $p$ is a prime satisfying $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ and asks to show that the congruence has no solutions for any integer $x$. The user mentions trying a proof by contradiction and Fermat's Little Theorem but getting stuck.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption on a separate line, ensuring each addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should then be clearly stated.\n\nFirst, the assumptions here are: \n1. $p$ is a prime number. \n2. $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. \n\nThese are two separate conditions on the prime $p$. Each should be listed as individual assumptions. Then, the problem is to prove that the congruence equation has no solutions in integers.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions $x$ being an integer, but since the congruence is modulo $p$, $x$ is considered in the set of integers modulo $p$. However, the problem statement already specifies $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so the main assumptions are about $p$.\n\nI should also ensure that the problem statement is concise, capturing the essence without extra details. The original problem statement in the question is clear: showing that the equation has no solutions when $p$ is a prime congruent to 3 mod 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the assumptions are each on their own line, and the problem is restated clearly.",
