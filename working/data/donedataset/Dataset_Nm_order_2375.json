    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is to show that the integral of sin^3(x)/x^3 from 0 to infinity equals 3π/8 using different methods. \n\nFirst, I should list all the assumptions. The problem statement mentions the integral from 0 to infinity, so the function is integrated over that interval. The integrand is sin^3(x)/x^3. The user wants to prove the result equals 3π/8. However, I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions. \n\nThe function sin^3(x)/x^3 is defined for all x > 0, but at x=0, the integrand seems problematic because both numerator and denominator approach zero. So maybe the integral is an improper type. Also, the convergence at infinity: since sin^3(x) is bounded and 1/x^3 decays like 1/x^3, which is integrable at infinity. So the integral converges. But the problem might assume that the integral is convergent. However, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the integral's existence might be part of the problem, so maybe it's not an assumption. The user just states to show the integral equals that value. So perhaps the only explicit assumption is the integral is from 0 to infinity of sin^3(x)/x^3 dx. But the example structured the problem by listing each assumption line by line. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, actually, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, that's conflicting. Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user might have made a mistake. Wait, maybe in the example, there was a typo or an error. But perhaps the user intended to show that when structuring the problem, you need to break down the original problem's conditions. But in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different version? The original example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if n is an integer divisible by 7, then the problem is to show A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction. \n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to show that the integral equals 3π/8. The assumptions here might be the integral is from 0 to infinity, the integrand is sin^3(x)/x^3, and that the integral converges. But maybe the user doesn't need to state convergence as an assumption because the problem is to compute it. So perhaps the only assumption is the integral is over [0, ∞) of sin^3(x)/x^3 dx. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval from 0 to infinity,\nThe integrand is sin³(x)/x³,\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the integral's interval is one assumption, the integrand is another, and maybe the convergence is another. But since the problem is to compute the integral, maybe convergence is part of the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is stated as given, so the only assumption is that the integral is as defined. But perhaps the example was different. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is not correctly formatted. But perhaps the user wants to split all the conditions.\n\nSo in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to ∞, the integrand is sin³(x)/x³, and the integral is convergent. However, the problem is to compute its value. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is (sin³x)/x³,\nThe integral is convergent.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the original problem's assumption was for every integer n, but in the formatted version, they added n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. So maybe the example is wrong. But the user might have intended that in some cases, you need to list all necessary conditions. However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't specify any conditions; it's just to compute the integral. So maybe the only assumption is the integral as defined. But according to the example, each assumption is one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is (sin³x)/x³.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this integral equals 3π/8. Since there's no other conditions given, perhaps those two are the only assumptions. The convergence is part of the problem, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the problem includes that the integral exists. But given the example, the user split the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions. So for the integral problem, the two main components are the interval and the integrand. So I'll list those as assumptions. Then the problem is to show it equals 3π/8.",
