    "AcceptedAnswer": "For any field $k$, the abelianization of $GL_n(k)$ is $k^{\\ast}$ except for $n=2$ and $k=\\mathbb{F}_2$ or $\\mathbb{F}_3$. I think this is in Lang's Algebra , Chapter XIII sections 8 and 9. (I say I think because I am relying on google books here, and some key pages are missing.) EDIT: I just looked back at this old answer, and the abelianization of $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ is $\\mathbb{F}_3^{\\times}$ as well, so $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_2)$ is the only counterexample. I think that what I was thinking when I wrote this is that the abelianization of $SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_3)$ in nontrivial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original question thoroughly.\n\nThe title is \"Abelianization of GL_n\". The question asks: Suppose k is a field. How to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k)? Similarly for GL_n(k). Can we say the same thing if we replace k with Z?\n\nAlright, the main task here is to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let me break down the components.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem mentions that k is a field. So that's one assumption. Then, they're asking about GL_2(k) and GL_n(k), so maybe we need to note that we're dealing with general linear groups of degree 2 and n over the field k. Also, the question extends to replacing k with Z (the integers), so another assumption would be considering Z instead of a field.\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on k beyond being a field, and then asks about replacing k with Z. So perhaps the assumptions should list the objects (GL_n(k) where k is a field, and GL_n(Z)), and perhaps the properties related to their abelianization.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's request had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the objects are k, GL_n(k), and Z. Let me think:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. k is a field.\n2. The abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup.\n3. GL_n(k) is the general linear group of degree n over k.\n4. GL_1(k) is the multiplicative group of the field k.\n5. Z is the ring of integers.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Then, whether replacing k with Z still holds. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a field.\n- For GL_n(k), consider its abelianization.\n- For the case when replacing k with Z, consider GL_n(Z).\n\nBut the example had each assumption as a separate line, each addressing one property. So let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup,\nGL_n(k) denotes the general linear group of degree n over k,\nGL_1(k) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the field k,\nThe question considers replacing the field k with the ring Z of integers.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in the original problem, the user might have had an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem statement didn't specify that. Wait, no, the original example was a problem where the user structured it as:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the user in their example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be correct. Hmm, perhaps the example was a mistake. But the user wants me to follow their format.\n\nWait, perhaps in their example, they misunderstood the problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems wrong. But maybe the example is just illustrative of the format, not necessarily accurate. So regardless, the task is to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented, but in the example, they included assumptions beyond the problem's original statement. Wait, maybe the example is a different problem where the user had to include additional assumptions. For instance, maybe the original problem required n to be divisible by 7 but wasn't explicit. Hmm. Maybe the example was part of a different problem where the divisibility by 7 was an implicit assumption.\n\nAnyway, moving back to the current problem. The question is about abelianization of GL_n(k) where k is a field, and whether replacing k with Z changes the result.\n\nSo the assumptions should list the given conditions. The problem states that k is a field. Then, the problem is to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Then, it asks if the same holds when replacing k with Z.\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- k is a field.\n- GL_n(k) is the general linear group of degree n over k.\n- The abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup.\n\nBut are these assumptions part of the problem's given conditions, or are they definitions the user is expected to know? The problem says \"How to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k)\", so it's assuming the reader knows what abelianization means. However, to list the assumptions as per the format, perhaps we need to include the definitions used.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be that n is an integer. But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow the format regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The problem states:\n\n\"Suppose k is a field. How to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k)? Ditto for GL_n(k). Can we say the same thing, were we to replace k with Z?\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- k is a field.\n- We are considering the abelianization of GL_2(k) and GL_n(k).\n- Considering replacing k with Z (the ring of integers).\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of GL_2(k) is considered,\nThe abelianization of GL_n(k) is considered,\nThe ring Z replaces the field k in the second part.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the abelianization is GL_1(k), so maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Determine if the same holds when k is replaced by Z.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup,\nGL_n(k) denotes the general linear group of degree n over k,\nGL_1(k) is the multiplicative group of k,\nZ denotes the ring of integers.\n\nBut some of these are definitions, not assumptions. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which were part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a field.\n- The problem considers the abelianization of GL_2(k) and GL_n(k).\n- The problem also considers replacing k with the ring Z.\n\nBut the user might not need to list definitions unless they're part of the problem's given conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the given conditions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of GL_2(k) is to be determined,\nThe abelianization of GL_n(k) is to be determined,\nThe ring Z is considered in place of k in a separate case.\n\nBut I think the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. k is a field.\n2. The groups in question are GL_2(k) and GL_n(k).\n3. The abelianization is computed for these groups.\n4. The case when k is replaced by the ring Z is considered.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of GL_2(k) is to be computed,\nThe abelianization of GL_n(k) is to be computed,\nThe ring Z replaces k in a separate scenario.\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Determine whether replacing k with Z yields the same result.\n\nBut to fit the format as in the example, which had the problem line restating the problem concisely. The example had:\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo for this case, the problem line should be:\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Determine if the same holds when k is replaced by Z.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be phrased more concisely. Let me check the original question:\n\nOriginal question: \"How to prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k)? Ditto for GL_n(k). Can we say the same thing, were we to replace k with Z?\"\n\nSo the problem is two parts: prove the abelianization is GL_1(k) for GL_2(k) and GL_n(k), and check if replacing k with Z holds.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup,\nGL_n(k) is the general linear group of degree n over k,\nGL_1(k) is the multiplicative group of the field k,\nZ is the ring of integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Determine whether replacing k with Z yields the same result.\n\nBut some of these assumptions might be considered part of the problem's background knowledge rather than explicit assumptions. However, following the example, which included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", it's possible that the user expects to list even implicit assumptions.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to extract the explicit conditions from the problem. The problem says \"Suppose k is a field\", so that's an assumption. Then it asks about GL_2(k) and GL_n(k), so those are the groups considered. Then it asks about replacing k with Z, so that's another assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a field.\n- The groups GL_2(k) and GL_n(k) are considered.\n- The ring Z is considered in place of k.\n\nBut maybe the abelianization is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the problem is to prove that the abelianization (which is a defined term) of these groups is GL_1(k), and check when k is replaced by Z.\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nThe abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup,\nZ is the ring of integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and likewise for GL_n(k). Investigate whether this remains true when k is replaced by Z.\n\nBut the example included assumptions about the objects in the problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nGL_n(k) denotes the general linear group of degree n over k,\nThe abelianization of a group is its quotient by the commutator subgroup,\nZ denotes the ring of integers.\n\nProblem: Prove that the abelianization of GL_2(k) is GL_1(k), and similarly for GL_n(k). Determine if replacing k with Z results in the same abelianization.\n\nI think this covers the necessary points. Each assumption is a single line addressing one property or object.",
