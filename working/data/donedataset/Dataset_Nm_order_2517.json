    "Content": "The problem is to prove that for $a,b,c>0$ we have $$\\frac{a^2}{b^2}+\\frac{b^2}{c^2}+\\frac{c^2}{a^2}+\\frac{9abc}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}\\geq \\frac{15}{4}.$$ I have tried to use Bergstrom/Engel inequality to write, for example, $\\frac{a^2}{b^2}+\\frac{b^2}{c^2}+\\frac{c^2}{a^2}\\geq \\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{a^2+b^2+c^2}$ , and then to use Muirhead's inequalities to prove the remaining inequality - but unsuccessfully, so far...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The cyclically symmetric inequality is equivalent to: $$\\color{red}{\\left(\\frac{a^2}{b^2}+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-2 \\right)} + \\color{blue}{\\left(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}+\\frac{c^2}{a^2}-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1 \\right)}+ \\color{green}{\\left(\\frac{9abc}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}-\\frac34\\right)} \\geqslant 0$$ $$\\iff \\color{red}{\\frac{(a^2-b^2)^2}{a^2b^2}} + \\color{blue}{\\frac{(a^2-c^2)(b^2-c^2)}{a^2c^2}}+\\color{green}{\\frac{9abc-3(a^3+b^3+c^3)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}}\\geqslant 0$$ As $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc=(a+b+c)((a-b)^2+(a-c)(b-c))$ , we have above $\\iff$ $$(a-b)^2\\left(\\color{red}{\\frac{(a+b)^2}{a^2b^2}}-\\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}} \\right)+(a-c)(b-c)\\left(\\color{blue}{\\frac{(a+c)(b+c)}{a^2c^2}} - \\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}}\\right)\\geqslant 0$$ Now due to symmetry, we may assume $c=\\min (a, b, c)$ , hence it remains to show that under this condition, both $$\\color{red}{\\frac{(a+b)^2}{a^2b^2}}-\\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}} \\geqslant 0, \\qquad \\color{blue}{\\frac{(a+c)(b+c)}{a^2c^2}} - \\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}} \\geqslant 0$$ However $(a^3+b^3)(a+b)\\geqslant (a^2+b^2)^2\\geqslant 4a^2b^2 \\implies$ $$\\color{red}{\\frac{(a+b)^2}{a^2b^2}}\\geqslant 4\\frac{a+b}{a^3+b^3}> 4\\frac{a+b}{a^3+b^3+c^3}\\geqslant \\frac83\\frac{a+b+c}{a^3+b^3+c^3}> \\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}}$$ And $3(a^3+b^3+c^3)\\geqslant (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2) \\implies$ $$4(a^3+b^3+c^3)(a+c)(b+c)\\geqslant \\frac43(a+b+c)(a+c)(b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2) \\geqslant \\frac43(a+b+c)(2c)(2c)(a^2)\\geqslant 3(a+b+c)a^2c^2$$ $$\\implies \\color{blue}{\\frac{(a+c)(b+c)}{a^2c^2}}\\geqslant \\color{green}{\\frac{3(a+b+c)}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}}$$ Hence the inequality holds true, with equality when $a=b=c$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Hard inequality for positive numbers\" and asks to prove an inequality involving positive real numbers a, b, c. The inequality given is:\n\n$$\\frac{a^2}{b^2}+\\frac{b^2}{c^2}+\\frac{c^2}{a^2}+\\frac{9abc}{4(a^3+b^3+c^3)}\\geq \\frac{15}{4}.$$\n\nThe user mentions they tried using Bergstrom/Engel and Muirhead inequalities without success. But my task isn't to solve it, just to structure it.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the Assumptions section lists each condition applied to one object. The original problem states that a, b, c are positive numbers. So each variable being positive should be a separate assumption.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on a separate line. So here, each variable (a, b, c) being positive should be individual assumptions. However, in the problem statement, it's given as a, b, c > 0. So maybe list each variable's positivity as separate assumptions.\n\nBut wait, the example had two conditions on n: being an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the only condition is that a, b, c are positive. So perhaps each variable is listed as positive, but the problem states \"for a,b,c >0\", which is three separate conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\na is positive,\n\nb is positive,\n\nc is positive.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people group variables, but according to the example, each condition is applied to one object. Since a, b, c are three different objects, each needs their own line.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given inequality.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have three assumptions (a, b, c each positive) and the problem statement as given.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, looking back: the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption is: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption should be \"n is an integer\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That might be an error. Perhaps the user intended to show a different problem where n has to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't mention that. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's instructions regardless.\n\nBut for the current problem, the user's example might have been a mistake, but the instruction is to structure the problem as per the format, with each assumption being one condition on one object.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the original states \"for a,b,c >0\". So each variable is positive. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\na is positive,\n\nb is positive,\n\nc is positive.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given inequality.\n\nThe user's attempt mentions using Bergstrom/Engel and Muirhead, but those are part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. So we don't include those in the formatted problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions (a, b, c each positive) and the problem statement as given.",
