    "Content": "Let $P_1=1$ and let $P_2=n+1$ define $$P_{i+1}=\\frac{P_i^2-1}{P_{i-1}}$$ Prove that if $a \\mid b$ then $ P_a \\mid P_b $ I am working on this problem for a while but I could use some help\nhere are the first 5 polynomials generated by this definition $$ P_3=n^2+2n$$ $$ P_4=n^3+3n^2+n-1$$ $$ P_5=n^4+4n^3+3n^2-2n-1$$ $$ P_6=n^5+5n^4+6n^3-2n^2-4n$$ $$ P_7=n^6+6n^5+10n^4-9n^2-2n+1$$ Note that for instance $P_2 \\mid P_6$ $$ \\frac{P_6}{P_2}=n^4+4n^3+2n^2−4n $$ also $P_3 \\mid P_6$ $$ \\frac{P_6}{P_3}=n^3+3n^2−2 $$ Finally $(P_2\\times P_3) \\mid P_6$ $$ \\frac{P_6}{P_2 \\times P_3}=n^2+2n−2 $$ So it seems to work but who can help me prove it (I think the induction method is the most appropriate) any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just an idea for a start. From given equation we can easily get this equation:$${P_{i+2}+P_{i}\\over P_{i+1}} = {P_{i+1}+P_{i-1}\\over P_{i}}$$ Since this is valid for all $i$ we have $$  {P_{i+1}+P_{i-1}\\over P_{i}}= {P_{3}+P_{1}\\over P_{2}} = n+1$$\nand thus we have a linear equation:\n$$ P_{i+1} = (n+1)P_{i}-P_{i-1}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that if a divides b, then P_a divides P_b, where the polynomials are defined recursively. The initial conditions are P₁ = 1 and P₂ = n + 1. The recursion formula is P_{i+1} = (P_i² - 1)/P_{i-1}. They also provided the first few polynomials, which seem to get more complex as the index increases.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The main goal is to show that for any integers a and b, if a divides b, then the polynomial P_a divides P_b. That is, when you divide P_b by P_a, there's no remainder. The example given shows that P₂ divides P₆ and P₃ divides P₆, and even the product P₂*P₃ divides P₆. This suggests that divisibility here might be related to the factors corresponding to the divisors of b.\n\nNow, let's structure the problem according to the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n1. The user defines P₁ = 1. So that's an initial condition.\n2. P₂ is defined as n + 1. Another initial condition.\n3. The recursive relation is given: For each i ≥ 2, P_{i+1} = (P_i² - 1)/P_{i-1}. That's a key part of the problem's setup.\n4. The problem statement is to prove that if a divides b, then P_a divides P_b. So the divisibility of indices implies divisibility of the polynomials.\n5. The examples provided (like P₂ | P₆ and P₃ | P₆) are specific instances but aren't assumptions, so they don't need to be listed in the assumptions section. They are just illustrative.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't mention any restrictions on a and b, other than a divides b. So the assumptions would include the definitions of P₁, P₂, the recursion formula, and the condition that a and b are positive integers with a | b. However, in the original problem statement, the user says \"if a | b then P_a | P_b\". The problem doesn't specify any constraints on a and b beyond that. So, possible assumptions:\n\n- P₁ is defined as 1.\n- P₂ is defined as n + 1.\n- For each integer i ≥ 2, P_{i+1} is defined as (P_i² - 1)/P_{i-1}.\n- a and b are positive integers such that a divides b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"if a | b\", so a and b must be positive integers where a divides b. But since the polynomials are indexed by positive integers (since P₁, P₂, etc.), we can assume that a and b are positive integers. So each assumption line should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- P₁ is defined as 1.\n- P₂ is defined as n + 1.\n- For each integer i ≥ 2, P_{i+1} is defined as (P_i² - 1)/P_{i-1}.\n- a and b are positive integers.\n- a divides b.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The first three define the sequence of polynomials, and the last two are the conditions given in the problem statement. The problem is to prove that under these conditions, P_a divides P_b.\n\nNow, checking the example provided by the user in the original problem. In their example, they listed the assumptions as the variable being an integer and a divisibility condition. Here, the variables a and b are positive integers with a | b. So each of these should be separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as above, and the problem statement is to prove that P_a divides P_b under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure that all the necessary information from the original question is included, filtered out of any extraneous details. The user mentions that they think induction is the way to go, but that's part of their thought process, not part of the problem statement. The examples with specific polynomials are also part of their exploration but not assumptions. So those should be excluded from the formatted problem.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- P₁ is defined as 1.\n- P₂ is defined as n + 1.\n- For each integer i ≥ 2, P_{i+1} is defined as (P_i² - 1)/P_{i-1}.\n- a and b are positive integers.\n- a divides b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that if a divides b, then P_a divides P_b.",
