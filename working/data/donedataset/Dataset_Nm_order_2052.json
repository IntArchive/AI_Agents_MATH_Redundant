Assume to the contrary that $$\\Bbb{Q}=\\Bbb{Z}\\dfrac{a_1}{b_1}+...+\\Bbb{Z}\\dfrac{a_n}{b_n}$$ where $a_i,b_i\\in\\Bbb{Z}$. Let lcm$(b_1,...,b_n)=c$ and $d_i=\\dfrac{c}{b_i}$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is in fact that easy. You can make it even simpler by noting you can conclude $\\mathbb Q \\subseteq \\langle \\frac{1}{c} \\rangle$ from your assumption. Since $\\frac{1}{2c}\\in\\mathbb Q$ we have $\\frac{1}{2c}=\\frac{k}{c}$ for some $k\\in\\mathbb Z$, but there is no $k\\in\\mathbb Z$ such that $2k=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is trying to show that ℚ is not a finitely generated ℤ-module. They presented a proof and are questioning why it seems too easy, suspecting they might have missed something. Let me parse their argument step by step.\n\nFirst, they assume the contrary: that ℚ is finitely generated as a ℤ-module. So, there exist fractions a₁/b₁, ..., aₙ/bₙ such that ℚ is the sum of ℤ*(a₁/b₁) + ... + ℤ*(aₙ/bₙ). Then, they take the least common multiple c of the denominators b₁,...,bₙ and rewrite each generator as (d_i a_i)/c where d_i = c/b_i. This makes all the generators have the same denominator c.\n\nNext, they consider a prime p that doesn't divide c. They argue that 1/p must be expressible as a ℤ-linear combination of these generators, leading to an equation p*(linear combination) = c. This implies p divides c, contradicting the choice of p. Hence, the initial assumption is wrong, so ℚ isn't finitely generated.\n\nBut the user feels this is too easy. Maybe they missed an assumption or step? Let's check for gaps. \n\nFirst, in a finitely generated ℤ-module, every element can be written as a ℤ-linear combination of the generators. The user correctly sets up that 1/p must be in the module, hence there's an equation (d₁a₁x₁ + ... + dₙaₙxₙ)/c = 1/p. Multiplying both sides by c gives the linear combination equals c/p. Wait, actually, let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait, the user writes 1/p = [d₁a₁x₁ + ... + dₙaₙxₙ]/c. Then multiplying both sides by c gives [d₁a₁x₁ + ... + dₙaₙxₙ] = c/p. But the left side is an integer because d_i, a_i, x_i are integers, so c/p must be an integer. Therefore, p divides c. Contradiction. So this seems correct. \n\nBut why does the user think it's suspicious? Maybe because in some similar proofs, you need more conditions. Let's see. For example, maybe the generators are supposed to be in ℤ, but here they are fractions. However, in a ℤ-module, coefficients are from ℤ, so linear combinations with integer coefficients are allowed. So even if the generators are fractions, the coefficients are integers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confusing modules with ideals or vector spaces. But in this case, the structure seems okay. Another point: when they take the LCM c of the denominators, that's valid because each denominator is an integer. Then d_i = c/b_i is an integer, so the rewritten generators (d_i a_i)/c are fractions with denominator c. So all elements of the module would have denominators dividing c, but 1/p has denominator p, which doesn't divide c. Therefore, unless p divides c, which it doesn't, you can't get 1/p in the module. Hence, contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the user's confusion comes from whether all denominators in the module must divide c. For example, if you have a module generated by elements with denominator c, then any element would be a sum of terms like k*(a/c), where k is integer, leading to a denominator dividing c. Therefore, 1/p can't be in the module unless p divides c. So the argument holds. \n\nSo perhaps the user's approach is correct, and their doubt is unfounded. Maybe they were expecting a more complicated proof, but this is actually a valid one. However, sometimes in textbooks, this is proven using that ℤ-modules (which are just abelian groups) that are finitely generated and torsion-free are free, but ℚ is divisible and not free, but that's a different approach. Alternatively, another approach uses that in a finitely generated ℤ-module, the denominators of elements are bounded, which is exactly what the user did. \n\nSo maybe the user's proof is correct. Then why the doubt? Maybe they think they need to check more cases or that the step where they rewrite the generators is not justified? Let me verify each step again. \n\nOriginal assumption: ℚ is generated by a finite set {a₁/b₁, ..., aₙ/bₙ}. Then, take c = lcm(b₁, ..., bₙ). Then each a_i/b_i = (a_i * (c/b_i)) / c = (d_i a_i)/c. So the module ℤ*(a_i/b_i) is equal to ℤ*(d_i a_i / c). Therefore, the entire module is the sum of these, which is (1/c) times the ℤ-module generated by d₁a₁, ..., dₙaₙ. But since d_i a_i are integers, the sum is just all integer multiples of (1/c) times integers, which is the same as (1/c)ℤ[d₁a₁, ..., dₙaₙ]. However, ℤ[d₁a₁, ..., dₙaₙ] is a submodule of ℤ, which is just equal to kℤ for some integer k (since ℤ is a PID). Therefore, the entire module would be (k/c)ℤ, which is a cyclic submodule of ℚ. But ℚ is not cyclic, so this would be a contradiction. Wait, but the user's approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, the user's rewritten form is that ℚ is equal to (1/c)(ℤ*d₁a₁ + ... + ℤ*dₙaₙ). But since the sum of the ℤ*d_i a_i is a finitely generated ℤ-submodule of ℤ, hence it's equal to mℤ for some integer m. Therefore, the entire module would be (m/c)ℤ, which is cyclic. But ℚ is not cyclic, so contradiction. This is another way to see it. But the user's approach uses primes not dividing c. \n\nIn the user's proof, they take a prime p not dividing c, then 1/p must be in the module, which would require c/p to be an integer, hence p divides c. Contradiction. Therefore, the user's proof is valid. \n\nSo maybe the user was just overthinking and their proof is correct. But why does the problem sometimes appear in more advanced contexts? Maybe because in some expositions, they approach it through properties of finitely generated modules over PIDs, but this direct proof using denominators is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in assuming that c is the lcm of the denominators. Let's check. If you have generators a_i/b_i, then the denominators are b_i. Taking c = lcm(b₁,...,bₙ) is correct. Then d_i = c/b_i, which is integer. So each generator is (a_i d_i)/c. Therefore, the module is generated by these fractions with denominator c. Therefore, every element in the module can be written as a sum of integers times these generators, leading to a denominator dividing c. Therefore, 1/p cannot be in the module if p doesn't divide c. Hence, the contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the user's proof is correct. They might have thought it was too easy because sometimes similar proofs require more steps, but in this case, the argument is straightforward. So the answer is that their proof is correct, and they didn't miss anything. But maybe the question is why they felt suspicious? Perhaps they expected a more complex argument, but the simplicity here is sufficient.",
