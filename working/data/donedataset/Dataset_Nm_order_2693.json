    "Content": "Double palindrome : ...is a number nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases $b,b\\pm1$ Let $d_1,d_2$ be numbers of digits in the two bases: nontrivially means $d_1,d_2\\gt 1$ . Let $d=\\max\\{d_1,d_2\\}$ be called the degree of a double palindrome. Example: $10$ is palindromic in bases $(b,b-1)=(4,3)$ with $(d_1,d_2)=(2,3)$ digits: $$10=(1,0)_{10} =(2,2)_4=(1,0,1)_3$$ Theorem 1. If $d$ is even, there are no examples. Even length (amount of digits) palindromes in base $b$ are divisible by $b+1$ . Thus, such palindrome will end in $0$ in the other base, and can't be a double palindrome. From now on, assume we have an odd degree $d=2l+1,l\\in \\mathbb N$ . Theorem 2. If $d_1=d_2$ , there are infinitely many double palindromes for every fixed $d$ . Example: $(b^{2l}-1)/(b+1)$ is palindromic in $(b,b+1)$ for all $b\\gt \\binom{2l}{l}$ , with $d=2l-1$ . the above result was discussed and proven in my other question . Conjecture. If $d_1\\ne d_2$ , there are finitely many double palindromes, for every fixed $d$ . Question. Is there any hope in proving this conjecture? Results on small cases of $d$ via brute force search: If $d=3$ , it can be shown the only solution is $10$ in bases $3,4$ , as: $$(1,0)_{10}=(1,0,1)_3=(2,2)_4$$ For $d=5$ , the following should be all of the solutions: $$\n130=(1, 1, 2, 1, 1)_{3}=(2, 0, 0, 2)_{4}\\\\\n651=(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)_{5}=(3, 0, 0, 3)_{6}\\\\\n2997=(1, 1, 5, 1, 1)_{7}=(5, 6, 6, 5)_{8}\\\\\n6886=(1, 0, 4, 0, 1)_{9}=(6, 8, 8, 6)_{10}\n$$ For $d=7$ , the following should be all of the solutions: $$\n9222=(2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2)_{4}=(2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2)_{5}\\\\\n26691=(1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1)_{5}=(3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3)_{6}\\\\\n27741=(1, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 1)_{5}=(3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3)_{6}\\\\\n626626=(1, 1, 5, 4, 5, 1, 1)_{9}=(6, 2, 6, 6, 2, 6)_{10}\\\\\n1798303=(1, 0, 1, 9, 1, 0, 1)_{11}=(7, 2, 8, 8, 2, 7)_{12}\\\\\n1817179=(1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1)_{11}=(7, 3, 7, 7, 3, 7)_{12}\n$$ And so on. For every $d$ , solutions seem to only exits in relatively small bases. For a general fixed $d=2l+1,l\\in\\mathbb N$ , is it possible to set upper bounds on base $b$ , after which solutions can't exits? - to prove the conjecture? That is, how to show that double palindromes can't exist in (arbitrarily large) number bases $(b,b\\pm1)$ , when $b\\gt b_0$ , for some value $b_0:=b_0(d)$ , if degree $d$ is fixed, and $d_1\\ne d_2$ ?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The almost-counterexample I gave in the comments has factor 2 in the denominators, and this is not without a reason. In fact, this factor prevents existence of an infinite series of solutions of a fixed length. Here is a proof. First notice that in an infinite series of solutions, values of $b$ cannot be bounded. This immediately proves the case $|d_1 - d_2|>1$ as one palindrome in this case is asymptotically at least factor $b$ times larger than the other. Hence, it remains to consider the case $|d_1-d_2|=1$ . Let $d=2l+1$ be the length of one palindrome and $d-1=2l$ be the length of the other. If $b$ is the base of the first palindrome, then the second must be in base $b+1$ (not $b-1$ as this palindrome divisible by the base plus 1). Then we need to solve $$\\sum_{i=0}^{l-1} a_i (b^i + b^{2l-i}) + a_l b^l = \\sum_{i=0}^{l-1} c_i ((b+1)^i + (b+1)^{2l-1-i})$$ in integers $a_0\\in[1,b-1]$ , $c_0\\in[1,b]$ , $a_i\\in [0,b-1]$ and $c_i\\in[0,b]$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,l\\}$ . Linearizing this equation as explained in my MO answer to a related question and expressing $a_0$ , $a_1$ , and $c_0$ , we get $$\\begin{cases}\na_0 = -k_d,\\\\\na_1 = -\\frac{d}2 k_0 b + k_1 b - k_0 - \\frac{d}2 k_d,\\\\\nc_0 = a_1 - k_d b + k_{d-1},\n\\end{cases}\n$$ where we have $k_0,k_1,k_{d-1},k_d$ are some integers whose lower and upper bounds depend on $d$ but not on $b$ . (Argument below is simplified.) To keep $a_1\\in[0,b-1]$ and $c_0\\in[1,b]$ for large $b$ , the coefficients of $b$ in $a_1$ and $c_0$ must be between $0$ and $1$ . Together with $a_0\\geq 1$ (i.e. $k_d\\leq -1$ ) this implies that $k_d=-1$ and the coefficient of $b$ in $a_1$ and $c_0$ equal $1$ and $0$ , respectively. Then, however, $a_1$ is a half-integer, which is impossible. Thus, an infinite series of solutions does not exist. QED",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe title is about finitely many palindromes in two consecutive number bases with fixed and distinct numbers of digits. The user defines a \"double palindrome\" as a number that's nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases, say b and b±1. The nontrivial part means that the number of digits in each base, d1 and d2, must both be greater than 1. The degree d is the maximum of d1 and d2. \n\nThe user mentions some theorems: Theorem 1 says that if d is even, there are no examples because even-length palindromes in base b are divisible by b+1, leading to a trailing zero in the other base, which disqualifies it. Theorem 2 states that if d1 = d2, there are infinitely many double palindromes for each fixed d. The conjecture is that if d1 ≠ d2, then there are finitely many such double palindromes for each fixed d. The question is whether there's hope in proving this conjecture, especially by setting upper bounds on the base b after which solutions can't exist.\n\nThe user provides examples for various degrees (d=3,5,7, etc.) and data showing that solutions seem to exist only in small bases. They ask how to show that for a fixed odd degree d=2l+1, there's a b0 such that for b > b0, no double palindromes exist when d1 ≠ d2.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove the conjecture that there are finitely many double palindromes when d1 ≠ d2 for each fixed d.\n\nFirst, the assumptions:\n\n1. A double palindrome is a number nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases b and b±1.\n   - This defines the main object, the double palindrome, with the condition of being palindromic in consecutive bases.\n\n2. The number of digits in the two bases, d1 and d2, satisfy d1, d2 > 1 (nontrivial).\n   - Each digit count must be greater than 1, so separate assumptions for d1 and d2? But the format says each line addresses one property or condition for one object. Maybe split into two assumptions: d1 > 1 and d2 > 1.\n\n3. The degree d is defined as max{d1, d2}.\n   - Assumption about the definition of d.\n\n4. The conjecture addresses the case when d1 ≠ d2.\n   - Specific condition on the relationship between d1 and d2.\n\n5. The degree d is fixed and odd (since Theorem 1 handles even d, and from the examples, d=3,5,7 are odd).\n   - Wait, the original problem mentions assuming d is odd in Theorem 2, but the conjecture is for fixed d where d1 ≠ d2. The user does say \"for fixed and distinct numbers of digits\", so maybe d is fixed as max{d1,d2}, which could be either odd or even. However, Theorem 1 says if d is even, there are no examples. So in the context of the conjecture, we're considering odd d since for even d, there are none. But the conjecture is about when d1 ≠ d2, regardless of d being odd. Wait, no. The problem states that Theorem 1 handles even d (no solutions), and the rest is about odd d. So maybe the assumption should be that d is odd. The user says \"From now on, assume we have an odd degree d=2l+1, l ∈ ℕ.\" So that's an important assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include:\n\n- d is an odd integer (d=2l+1 for some l ∈ ℕ).\n- d1 and d2 are the number of digits in bases b and b±1, respectively.\n- d1 ≠ d2.\n- d1 > 1 and d2 > 1 (nontrivial palindromes).\n- The number is a palindrome in both bases b and b±1.\n\nPutting this together, each as separate lines addressing one property or condition.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are finitely many double palindromes for each fixed odd degree d when d1 ≠ d2.\n\nWait, the exact conjecture is: \"If d1 ≠ d2, there are finitely many double palindromes, for every fixed d.\" But according to the theorems, when d is even, there are none. So the conjecture is about fixed d (which would be odd, since even d is already ruled out). So the problem is to prove that for each fixed odd d, if d1 ≠ d2, then there are finitely many such numbers.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, the assumptions would list the conditions given in the problem. Let me make sure each assumption is one line, one condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- A number is nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases $b$ and $b \\pm 1$.\n- The number of digits $d_1$ in base $b$ satisfies $d_1 > 1$.\n- The number of digits $d_2$ in base $b \\pm 1$ satisfies $d_2 > 1$.\n- The degree $d = \\max\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ is fixed.\n- The number of digits $d_1 \\neq d_2$.\n- The degree $d$ is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are finitely many such numbers for each fixed odd $d$.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement as per the user's question is: \"Is there any hope in proving this conjecture?\" and \"how to show that double palindromes can't exist in (arbitrarily large) number bases (b, b±1), when b > b0, for some value b0 := b0(d), if degree d is fixed, and d1 ≠ d2?\"\n\nBut the format requires the problem to be stated concisely. So perhaps the problem is to prove the conjecture that for each fixed odd degree d with d1 ≠ d2, there are finitely many double palindromes.\n\nSo the final structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA number is nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases $b$ and $b \\pm 1$,\n$d_1$ is the number of digits in base $b$,\n$d_2$ is the number of digits in base $b \\pm 1$,\n$d_1 > 1$,\n$d_2 > 1$,\n$d = \\max\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ is fixed,\n$d$ is odd,\n$d_1 \\neq d_2$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are finitely many such numbers for each fixed odd $d$.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single property on one object. Let me list them line by line:\n\n1. A number is nontrivially palindromic in two consecutive bases $b$ and $b \\pm 1$.\n   - This combines two conditions: being palindromic in two consecutive bases and nontrivially so. But \"nontrivially\" means d1, d2 >1, which are separate assumptions. Maybe split this into two lines: \n\nWait, the original problem defines \"nontrivially\" as d1, d2 >1. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is palindromic in two consecutive bases $b$ and $b \\pm 1$,\n$d_1$ is the number of digits in base $b$,\n$d_2$ is the number of digits in base $b \\pm 1$,\n$d_1 > 1$,\n$d_2 > 1$,\n$d = \\max\\{d_1, d_2\\}$,\n$d$ is fixed,\n$d$ is odd,\n$d_1 \\neq d_2$.\n\nYes, each line now addresses a single property. The first line is the main condition of being a double palindrome in consecutive bases. Then the definitions of d1 and d2, followed by their nontriviality, then the degree definition, fixed d, d is odd, and d1 ≠ d2.\n\nProblem: Prove that there are finitely many such numbers for each fixed odd $d$.\n\nThis seems to fit the format. Let me compare with the example given. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the assumptions are more numerous but each is a single condition.",
