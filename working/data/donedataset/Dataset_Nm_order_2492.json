    "Content": "If $n$ is a positive integer greater than 1 such that $3n+1$ is perfect square, then show that $n+1$ is the sum of three perfect squares. My work: $3n+1=x^2$ $3n+3=x^2+2$ $3(n+1)=x^2+2$ $(n+1)=\\dfrac{x^2+2}{3}$ I have no clue what to do next. Please help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We are given that $3n+1 = a^2 $ . We want to show that $n+1$ is the sum of 3 perfect squares. Note that $a$ is not a multiple of 3. If $ a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ , then observe that $9n+9 = 3a^2 + 6 = (a-1)^2 + (a-1)^2 + (a+2)^2$ , and hence $$ n+1 = \\left( \\frac{a-1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{a-1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{a+2}{3} \\right)^2. $$ If $ a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ , then observe that $9n+9 = 3a^2 + 6 = (a+1)^2 + (a+1)^2 + (a-2)^2$ , and hence $$ n+1 = \\left( \\frac{a+1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{a+1}{3} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{a-2}{3} \\right)^2 $$ Thus the result is true. The motivation behind the solution is: We want to show that $n+1$ is the sum of 3 squares, and the only thing that we have to work with is $a^2$ , and possibly things around it. Since $3a^2$ (the naive sum of 3 squares) is so close to $9n+9$ , this suggests that we have some sort of wriggle room. Remembering that we have to account for the factor of 3 then greatly restricts our options. As an extension, show that $n+3$ can also be written as the sum of 3 perfect squares, using a similar approach.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to show that if n is a positive integer greater than 1 and 3n + 1 is a perfect square, then n + 1 is the sum of three perfect squares. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that n is a positive integer greater than 1. That's one assumption. Then, it mentions that 3n + 1 is a perfect square. So those are two separate conditions on n. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But here, the conditions are n is a positive integer greater than 1, and 3n + 1 is a perfect square. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. Let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem doesn't mention anything else, so the two assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. n is greater than 1.\n3. 3n + 1 is a perfect square.\n\nWait, wait. Wait the original problem says \"n is a positive integer greater than 1\", so that's two separate conditions: positive integer and greater than 1. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n is a positive integer\" is one condition, and \"n is greater than 1\" is another. Then \"3n + 1 is a perfect square\" is a third condition. So three assumptions in total.\n\nThen the problem is to show that n + 1 is the sum of three perfect squares. So putting that together.\n\nLet me cross-verify with the example. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but in the example, the user added that? Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But perhaps the user intended that example, even if it's not matching. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user didn't add any extra assumptions, just the ones from the original question. So for this problem, the assumptions should be as stated: n is a positive integer, n >1, and 3n+1 is a perfect square. So three assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn is greater than 1,\n3n + 1 is a perfect square.\n\nProblem:\nShow that n + 1 is the sum of three perfect squares.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check again. The user's work starts with 3n +1 = x², then manipulates to 3(n+1) = x² + 2, so (n+1) = (x² + 2)/3. Then they're stuck. The problem is to show that n+1 can be expressed as the sum of three squares. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are correct as above. The example given by the user had an original problem where the assumptions were split into two (integer and divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't specify divisibility by 7. But maybe that example was a mistake. However, in the current problem, we have to follow the original problem's conditions. So the answer should list those three assumptions as separate lines.",
