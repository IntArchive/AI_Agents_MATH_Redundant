    "Content": "I need to prove the following: There's no continuous function $f:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ that takes each of its values $f(x)$, $x\\in [a,b]$  exactly twice. First of all, I didn't understand the question. For example $x^2$ takes $1$ twice, in the interval $[-1,1]$. Is it saying that it does not occur for all $x$ in the interval? But what about $f(x) = c$? Is it saying that it does not occur only exactly $2$ times, then? I have no idea about how to prove it. I know that for $f(x)$ such that $f(a)<f(x)<f(b)$, if $f$ is continuous then there is a $c\\in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = f(x)$. Now, there's the following proof in my book and I really wanted to understand it, instead of just getting a new proof Since the interval $[a,b]$ has only $2$ extreme points, then the maximum or minimum of $f$ must be in a point $c\\in int([a,b])$ and and in another point $d\\in [a,b]$. Then, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that in the intervals $[c-\\delta, c), (c,c+\\delta)$ (and if $d$ is not extreme of $[a,b]$, $[d-\\delta, d]$) the function takes values that are less than $f(c) = f(d)$. Let $A$ be the greatest of the numbers $f(c-\\delta), f(c+\\delta), f(d-\\delta)$. By the intermediate value theorem, there are $x\\in [c-\\delta, c), y\\in (c, c+\\delta]$ and $z\\in [d-\\delta, d)$ such that $f(x)=f(y)=f(z)=A$. Contradiction. Well, why the last part? Why is it that I can apply the intermediate value theorem to these values? For example, $<f(c-\\delta)<p<f(c)$, then by the theorem I know that there exists $m\\in [c-\\delta, c)$ such that $f(m) = p$. Same for the other intervals. But what guarantees thhat the greatest of the values between  $x\\in [c-\\delta, c), y\\in (c, c+\\delta]$ will be inside the intervals $[c-\\delta), c), (c,c+\\delta), [d-\\delta, d)$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Earlier I had linked my question with this one of yours and it was closed as a duplicate. But you are not so much interested in knowing a proof of the result, but rather you are interested in understanding the proof given in your textbook. The following answer is thus an explanation for the proof given in your textbook. The solution given in your textbook is very concise and does not give all the details. Since $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ its range is also a closed interval $[m, M]$. The solution assumes that $m < M$ otherwise $f$ is a constant and does not meet hypotheses of the question. Next it says that the value $M$ is taken at two distinct points $c, d$ and says that one of them say $c \\in (a, b)$ and $d \\in [a, b]$. It is however possible that both $c, d$ are endpoints of $[a, b]$. This is not mentioned or considered in the solution. Anyway proceeding with the textbook solution let $c \\in (a, b), d \\in [a, b]$ and $f(c) = f(d) = M$. Moreover $f(x) < M$ for all $x \\in [a, b], x \\neq c, x\\neq d$. Next the solution proposes the existence of $\\delta > 0$ such that $f(x) < M$ for all $x \\in [c - \\delta, c) \\cup (c, c + \\delta)$. Further if $d \\neq a$ then we also have $f(x) < M$ for all $x \\in [d - \\delta, d)$ ( there is a typo in the solution where it writes $[d - \\delta, d]$ instead of $[d - \\delta, d)$) . All these statements are true by the last sentence of previous paragraph. And note that the solution does not handle the case $d = a$ . Now it considers $$A = \\max(f(c - \\delta), f(c + \\delta), f(d - \\delta))$$ BTW out of these values $f(c - \\delta), f(c + \\delta), f(d - \\delta)$ at max two can be equal. If $B$ is the minimum of these values then $B < A < M$ and thus by intermediate value theorem $A$ is attained once in each of the three intervals $[c - \\delta, c], [c, c + \\delta]$ and $[d - \\delta, d]$ and thus $f$ takes the value $A$ at three distinct points $x, y, z$. That these three points are distinct follows from the fact that $\\delta$ can be chosen so that $(c - \\delta), (c, c + \\delta)$ and $(d - \\delta, d)$ are pairwise disjoint. This is contrary to the hypotheses in the question. This completes the proof. The solution needs to address the two cases which are left out: The case when $c, d$ are both the end points of $[a, b]$. The case when $d = a$ and $c \\in (a, b)$. Here we consider $[d, d + \\delta]$ and argue like your textbook solution. For the first case when $c, d$ are endpoints so that for example $c = a, d = b$, we necessarily need to consider the points $p, q \\in (a, b), p < q$ where $f$ takes minimum value $m$. Thus we have $f(p) = f(q) = m < M = f(a) = f(b)$. Note further that all the values of $f$ in $(p, q)$ are greater than $m$ and hence if $M'$ is maximum value of $f$ in $[p, q]$ then $m < M' < M$. And suppose $M'$ is attained at $r \\in (p, q)$. Let $K$ be any number such that $m < K < M' < M$. Then by intermediate value theorem $f$ takes the value $K$ once in each of the intervals $(a, p), (p, r), (r, q), (q, b)$ and this contradicts the hypotheses.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down the problem and the example provided. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format, similar to the example given. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about showing that there's no continuous function on a closed interval [a, b] that takes each of its values exactly twice. The user had some confusion about the problem statement, thinking about examples like x² which takes some values twice, but the key here is \"each of its values exactly twice.\" So, the function can't take any value more or less than two times. \n\nIn the example provided, the user structured the problem by listing assumptions line by line. For the given problem here, the assumptions would need to include the conditions given in the problem. Let me parse the question again:\n\nThe problem states: There's no continuous function f: [a,b] → ℝ such that every value f(x) is taken exactly twice. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. f is a continuous function.\n2. The domain of f is the closed interval [a, b].\n3. For every x in [a, b], the value f(x) is taken exactly twice by f.\n\nWait, the problem is saying that each value in the range is taken exactly twice. So, for every y in the range of f, there are exactly two distinct points x₁ and x₂ in [a, b] such that f(x₁) = f(x₂) = y. \n\nBut the user's initial confusion was interpreting this. For example, the function x² on [-1, 1] takes the value 1 exactly twice (at x=1 and x=-1), but other values like 0 are only taken once (at x=0). So, this function doesn't satisfy the condition because some values are taken once or twice. The problem is asserting that no continuous function can have every value taken exactly twice. \n\nThe assumptions should capture the necessary conditions given in the problem statement. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is a continuous function.\n- The domain of f is the interval [a, b].\n- For every x in [a, b], the value f(x) is attained exactly two times in [a, b].\n\nWait, but the problem says \"takes each of its values f(x) exactly twice.\" So, it's for every y in the image of f, there are exactly two distinct points x₁, x₂ in [a, b] with f(x₁)=f(x₂)=y. So maybe the third assumption should be phrased as \"Each value in the image of f is attained exactly two times in [a, b].\"\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Here, the objects are f, the domain [a,b], and the values of f.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a continuous function,\nThe domain of f is the interval [a, b],\nEach value in the image of f is attained exactly two times in [a, b].\n\nProblem: Show that there's no continuous function f: [a,b] → ℝ that takes each of its values exactly twice.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Show that there's no continuous function that takes each of its values $f(x)$ exactly twice.\" So perhaps the problem statement is exactly that.\n\nThe user's question also mentions the user's confusion and the book's proof, but for the purpose of formatting the problem, we need to filter out the unrelated information and structure it as per the example. So the problem is to show that there's no such continuous function. The assumptions are the continuity, the domain being [a,b], and each value being taken exactly twice.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is a continuous function,\nThe domain of f is the interval [a, b],\nEach value in the image of f is attained exactly two times in [a, b].\nProblem: \nShow that there's no continuous function $f:[a,b]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ that takes each of its values $f(x)$, $x\\in [a,b]$ exactly twice.\n###",
