    "Content": "Let $(X,d)$ a metric space and $A\\subset X$ . Prove that $$\\overline{(A^c)}=\\overset{\\circ}{(A)}^c$$ i.e. the closure of complement, is  the complement of the interior. Proof. If $x\\in \\overline{(A^c)}$ then $x\\in A^c$ or $x\\in (A^c)'$ . Since $\\overset{\\circ}{A} \\subset A \\Rightarrow A^c \\subset \\overset{\\circ}{(A)}^c$ so, if $x\\in A^c$ then $x\\in \\overset{\\circ}{(A)}^c$ . Now if $x \\not\\in A^c$ but $x\\in (A^c)'$ then $\\forall r>0, B(x;r)-\\{x\\}\\cap A^c \\not= \\emptyset.$ And now I've to deduce that $x\\not\\in \\overset{\\circ}{A}$ so $x\\in \\overset{\\circ}{(A)}^c$ , but I can't figure out how.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think this is easier to do if you consider the closure $\\overline{A}$ as the set of elements of $X$ such that any open ball around them intersects $A$, that is, $$\\overline{A} = \\{ x \\in X \\mid \\forall \\epsilon > 0, B(x,\\epsilon) \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset \\}.$$  Similarly, one definition of interior is the set of elements of $X$ such that you can find an $\\epsilon$-ball around them contained in $A$, that is,$$A^{\\circ} = \\{ x \\in X \\mid \\exists \\epsilon > 0 \\text{ s.t. } B(x,\\epsilon) \\subseteq A \\}.$$ Now, to prove the claim, first we will show $\\overline{A^{c}} \\subseteq (A^{\\circ})^{c}:$ Let $x \\in \\overline{A^{c}}$.  Then for every $\\epsilon > 0$, $B(x, \\epsilon) \\cap A^{c} \\neq \\emptyset$.  But this means any ball around $x$ will intersect with $A^{c}$, which means you can never find a ball around $x$ that is contained in $A$.  That means $x \\not \\in A^{\\circ}$.  Thus, $x \\not \\in A^{\\circ} \\implies x \\in (A^{\\circ})^{c}$. Now to show $(A^{\\circ})^{c} \\subseteq \\overline{A^{c}}:$ Let $x \\in (A^{\\circ})^{c}$.  Then $x \\not \\in A^{\\circ}$.  But this means there does not exist $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $B(x,\\epsilon) \\subseteq A$.  But this means for every $\\epsilon > 0$, $B(x,\\epsilon) \\cap A^{c} \\neq \\emptyset$, and this is precisely what we need for $x \\in \\overline{A^{c}}$.  So we are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. Let me first understand the example provided to ensure I follow the correct approach.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version lists assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems like the user's example might have an error, but perhaps the example was a misrepresentation. Wait, actually, looking back, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. Hmm, maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. Anyway, the key is that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line.\n\nNow, the current problem from Math Stack Exchange is about proving that the closure of the complement of a set A in a metric space X is equal to the complement of the interior of A. The user's attempt starts by assuming x is in the closure of A^c, which means x is either in A^c or is a limit point of A^c. Then they mention that the interior of A is a subset of A, so A^c is a subset of the complement of the interior of A. Then they try to handle the cases where x is in A^c or a limit point of A^c. The user is stuck on showing that if x is a limit point of A^c but not in A^c, then x is not in the interior of A.\n\nThe task is to structure this problem according to the given format. The assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem, each on a separate line, addressing one property per line. Let's parse the original problem:\n\nOriginal problem statement: Let (X,d) be a metric space and A be a subset of X. Prove that the closure of the complement of A is the complement of the interior of A, i.e., closure(A^c) = (interior(A))^c.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. (X, d) is a metric space.\n2. A is a subset of X.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the equality of the closure of the complement and the complement of the interior.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the problem statement, and then added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original. But in the current problem, there's no hidden assumption; the problem is stated as given. So perhaps the example had some error, but the correct approach here is to list the given assumptions from the problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n(X, d) is a metric space,\nA is a subset of X.\n\nProblem: Prove that the closure of the complement of A is equal to the complement of the interior of A, i.e., $$\\overline{A^c} = (\\overset{\\circ}{A})^c.$$\n\nWait, the user's example included assumptions that weren't explicitly in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7.\" That seems incorrect. However, perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information, so maybe in the example, the original problem had more context, but in the provided example, the user added an assumption. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but \"for every integer n\" already includes all integers, so adding \"n is divisible by 7\" would restrict it. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their own structuring. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions, even those that are part of the problem's universal quantifier. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem was for n divisible by 7, but the user's example formatting added that as an assumption. Hmm. Well, perhaps the key is that in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions given in the problem, each on a separate line.\n\nThe original problem here is: Let (X,d) be a metric space and A be a subset of X. Prove that closure(A^c) = (interior(A))^c.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- (X, d) is a metric space.\n- A is a subset of X.\n\nEach as separate points. The problem is to prove the equality of those two sets.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$(X, d)$ is a metric space,\n$A$ is a subset of $X$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\overline{A^c} = \\left( \\overset{\\circ}{A} \\right)^c.$$\n\nI think that's correct. The user's attempt in the question is part of their solution attempt, which we don't need to include in the formatted problem. The task is just to structure the problem as per the given example, which in this case involves extracting the assumptions and the problem statement.",
