    "Content": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be Banach spaces. A bounded operator $T\\colon X\\to Y$ is called Fredholm iff The dimension of $\\ker(T)$ is finite, The codimension of the image $\\mathrm{im}(T)$ is finite, The image $\\mathrm{im}(T)$ is closed in $Y$.

I've checked some books on functional-analysis without finding a proof of this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that $T$ is injective, because if it is not we know that $\\textrm{ker}(T)$ is closed so we can replace $T$ by the induced map from $X/\\textrm{ker}(T)$ (which is a Banach space). Now define $T' := X \\oplus C \\to Y$ by $T'(x, c) = T(x) + c$ where $C$ is a closed complement for the range of $T$. This $T'$ is clearly bounded, linear and an isomorphism. So by the open mapping theorem $T'$ is open. Note that $\\textrm{im}(T) = T'(X \\oplus \\{0\\})$ which is closed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's guidelines. Let me start by carefully reading the original problem.\n\nThe title is asking whether the closedness of the image of a Fredholm operator is implied by the finiteness of the codimension of its image. The question body provides more context: the operator T is between Banach spaces X and Y, and the definition of Fredholm includes three conditions—finite-dimensional kernel, finite codimension of the image, and the image being closed. The user is questioning if the third condition (closed image) is redundant because some lecture notes claim it follows from the second condition (finite codimension) and the open mapping theorem. They also mention checking functional analysis books without finding a proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and structure the problem correctly. The user wants each assumption to be on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the problem.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. X and Y are Banach spaces. (This is stated in the problem.)\n2. T: X → Y is a bounded operator. (Fredholm operators are bounded by definition, so this is an assumption.)\n3. T is a Fredholm operator, which traditionally means:\n   a. dim(ker T) is finite.\n   b. codim(im T) is finite.\n   c. im T is closed in Y.\n   However, the question is whether condition c is redundant. The user's problem is whether c follows from b and the open mapping theorem. So, in their setup, they are considering if given a and b, does c hold automatically?\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased in the question: \"Is the third condition redundant? Some lecture notes claim that the third condition follows from the second one together with the open mapping theorem.\" So the key here is to list the assumptions under which the third condition is being questioned. The original problem's context is: given that T is a bounded operator between Banach spaces, with finite-dimensional kernel and finite codimensional image, does the image being closed follow? Therefore, the assumptions here are:\n\n- X and Y are Banach spaces.\n- T: X → Y is a bounded operator.\n- dim(ker T) is finite.\n- codim(im T) is finite.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that im T is closed, making the third condition redundant.\n\nWait, but the user's example for the previous problem included assumptions as separate lines, each addressing one property. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. X is a Banach space.\n2. Y is a Banach space.\n3. T: X → Y is a bounded operator.\n4. The dimension of ker(T) is finite.\n5. The codimension of im(T) is finite.\n\nProblem: Is im(T) closed in Y?\n\nBut in the original question, the user is asking if the third condition (im(T) closed) is redundant when the other two are given. So the problem is to prove or confirm that under the given assumptions (X,Y Banach; T bounded; dim ker T finite; codim im T finite), then im T must be closed. Therefore, the problem statement is: Prove that im(T) is closed in Y.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems wrong. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the example is not correctly formatted? Wait, the user says \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So perhaps the user made an error in their example. But in this case, I should follow the instructions, not the example's potential mistake.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure it into Assumption and Problem. The example might have been an error, but the user wants to process the current problem correctly.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The original problem is asking if, given that T is a bounded operator between Banach spaces, with finite-dimensional kernel and finite codimension of the image, does the image being closed follow? So the assumptions are the four listed above, and the problem is whether im(T) is closed.\n\nBut the user's format example includes assumptions each on one line, addressing one property. So each assumption line should be a single condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a Banach space.\n- Y is a Banach space.\n- T: X → Y is a bounded operator.\n- The dimension of ker(T) is finite.\n- The codimension of im(T) is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that im(T) is closed in Y.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking whether the third condition in the definition of Fredholm operator (closed image) is redundant, given the other two conditions (finite kernel and finite codimension). Therefore, the problem is indeed to prove that if T is a bounded operator between Banach spaces with finite-dimensional kernel and finite codimensional image, then the image is closed. Hence, the problem statement is to prove im(T) is closed.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly extracted. The problem mentions \"the third condition follows from the second one together with the open mapping theorem\". Wait, the second condition in the definition is finite codimension of the image, and the open mapping theorem applies to bounded surjective operators between Banach spaces. However, in this problem, the image might not be surjective, but having finite codimension. So the key is that if im(T) has finite codimension, then it must be closed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reasoning is that finite codimension implies that im(T) is complemented, and complemented subspaces in Banach spaces are closed. But I'm not sure. Anyway, the problem is structured as per the user's request.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title says \"Is the closedness of the image of a Fredholm operator implied by the finiteness of the codimension of its image?\" So the main question is whether finite codimension (second condition) implies closed image (third condition), given that the operator is between Banach spaces and has finite-dimensional kernel (first condition). Wait, no—the original definition includes three conditions. The question is, if we have conditions 1 (finite kernel) and 2 (finite codimension of image), does condition 3 (closed image) automatically hold?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X and Y are Banach spaces.\n- T is a bounded operator from X to Y.\n- dim(ker T) is finite.\n- codim(im T) is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that im T is closed in Y.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these four assumptions and then the problem is to prove the image is closed.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"the third condition follows from the second one together with the open mapping theorem\". So perhaps the finite kernel isn't needed? Or is it?\n\nWait, maybe the finite kernel is required as part of the Fredholm operator definition. But the user's question is, in the definition of a Fredholm operator (which includes three conditions), is the third condition (closed image) redundant if you have the first two (finite kernel and finite codim image)?\n\nTherefore, the problem is: Given T: X → Y (Banach spaces) is a bounded operator with finite-dimensional kernel and finite codimensional image, must the image be closed?\n\nThus, the assumptions are as above.\n\nBut let me verify. The original problem is whether in the definition of Fredholm operator, the closed image condition is redundant if we have finite codim image. So the problem is to show that if T is a bounded operator between Banach spaces, with dim ker T finite and codim im T finite, then im T is closed.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- X is a Banach space.\n- Y is a Banach space.\n- T: X → Y is a bounded operator.\n- The dimension of ker(T) is finite.\n- The codimension of im(T) is finite.\n\nProblem: Prove that im(T) is closed in Y.\n\nThat's the correct structure. Each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. Then the problem is to prove the image is closed.",
