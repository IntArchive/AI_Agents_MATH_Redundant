    "Content": "Suppose $M$ is a Riemannian manifold. Consider flow $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}g_{ij}=-2(R_{ij}+\\nabla_i \\nabla_j f)$, where $f$ is a time-dependent function. I would like to prove that flows of this form are equivalent, up to diffeomorphism, to the Ricci flow $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}g_{ij}=-2R_{ij}$, that is: By defining a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphism $\\Psi(t):M\\to M$ by $$\\frac{d}{dt}\\Psi(t)=\\nabla_{g(t)}f(t),$$\n$$\\Psi(0)=id_M$$ I want to show that $\\bar{g}(t):=\\Psi(t)^*g(t)$ satisfy\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\bar{g}_{ij}=-2 \\bar{R}_{ij}.$$ My problem is that I don't know how to calculate $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(t)^*g(t)$. I know that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(t)^* \\alpha=\\mathcal{L}_{\\nabla f} \\alpha$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is Lie derivative and $\\alpha$ is a time-independent object, but I faced problem when $\\alpha$ is a time-dependent object. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance for your time.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You can get the correct answer by applying the formal Leibniz/product rule to the expression: \\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\Psi\\left(t\\right)^{*}g\\left(t\\right))\\right) & = & \\frac{\\partial\\Psi\\left(t\\right)^{*}}{\\partial t}g\\left(t\\right)+\\Psi\\left(t\\right)^{*}\\frac{\\partial g\\left(t\\right)}{\\partial t}\\\\\n & = & \\Psi^{*}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\nabla f}g\\right)-2\\Psi^{*}\\left(\\textrm{Rc}+\\nabla\\nabla f\\right)\\\\\n & = & \\Psi^{*}\\left(-2\\textrm{Rc}\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray*} This calculation is written out in slightly more detail in Chapter 9.4 of http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/book.pdf . For a more rigorous proof, start by defining $f(u,v) = \\Psi(u)^* g(v),$ so that we are trying to compute $\\frac{d}{dt}f(t,t).$ Since everything here is smooth, we can apply the multivariable chain rule to rewrite this as $$\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{d}{dt}f(t,t) & = & \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v}\\right)_{u=t,\\;v=t} \\\\\n& = & \\left(\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}\\left(\\Psi(u)^{*}g(v)\\right)\n+ \n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v}\\left(\\Psi(u)^{*}g(v)\\right)\n\\right)_{u=t,\\;v=t}\n\\end{eqnarray*}.\n$$ The first term here is $\\Psi(u)^*\\left(\\mathcal L_{\\nabla f}g(v)\\right)$ by the definition of the Lie derivative, and the second term is $\\Psi(u)^* \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}g(v)$ because $\\Psi(u)^*$ is pointwise linear. Then just make the substitutions $u = t, v = t$ to obtain the result I claimed earlier.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can filter out unrelated information and present the problem in a specific format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title mentions that the Ricci flow and another flow involving the function f are equivalent up to diffeomorphism. The user is trying to prove that by defining a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms generated by the gradient of f, the pulled-back metric satisfies the Ricci flow equation.\n\nThe problem they're having is calculating the time derivative of the pulled-back metric, especially since the metric itself is time-dependent. They mention knowing how Lie derivatives work for time-independent objects but struggle when things are time-dependent.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. M is a Riemannian manifold. That's given in the problem statement.\n2. The flow ∂g_ij/∂t = -2(R_ij + ∇_i ∇_j f). This is the modified Ricci flow with the function f.\n3. The 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms Ψ(t) is defined by dΨ(t)/dt = ∇_{g(t)} f(t), with Ψ(0) = id_M. So this is the diffeomorphism generated by the gradient of f with respect to the metric g(t).\n4. The pulled-back metric is defined as \\bar{g}(t) = Ψ(t)*g(t). The user wants to show this satisfies the standard Ricci flow equation.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, the pulled-back metric's time derivative is -2 times its Ricci curvature.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed separately. So, breaking it down:\n\n- M is a Riemannian manifold.\n- The flow ∂g_ij/∂t = -2(R_ij + ∇_i ∇_j f) holds.\n- Ψ(t) is a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms defined by dΨ(t)/dt = ∇_{g(t)} f(t).\n- Ψ(0) is the identity map on M.\n- \\bar{g}(t) is defined as the pullback of g(t) by Ψ(t).\n\nThe problem statement is to show that the time derivative of \\bar{g}(t) is -2\\bar{R}_{ij}.\n\nWait, in the original problem, they specify \"up to diffeomorphism\", so the key is showing the equivalence via this diffeomorphism. The user's specific problem is computing the time derivative of the pulled-back metric, considering both the time dependence of g(t) and the diffeomorphism Ψ(t).\n\nSo the assumptions are all the given conditions in the problem setup. Let me list them one by one:\n\nAssumption:\n- $M$ is a Riemannian manifold.\n- The metric $g(t)$ evolves according to $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}g_{ij} = -2(R_{ij} + \\nabla_i \\nabla_j f)$.\n- $\\Psi(t): M \\to M$ is a 1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms defined by $\\frac{d}{dt}\\Psi(t) = \\nabla_{g(t)} f(t)$.\n- $\\Psi(0)$ is the identity map on $M$.\n- $\\bar{g}(t) = \\Psi(t)^* g(t)$.\n\nProblem: Show that $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\bar{g}_{ij} = -2 \\bar{R}_{ij}$.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object or condition. The problem is exactly what the user wants to prove. I think that's all. The user's specific confusion about time-dependent objects is part of the problem context but not an assumption, so it goes into the problem statement.",
