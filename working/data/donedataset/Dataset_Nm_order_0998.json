    "Content": "No matter where I would look it would seem that L'Hospital's Rule has a strange proof-given that they teach it in high school, it seems troublesome that I can't find a solid proof at that level of knowledge. Does anyone have a proof that is fairly basic? Or does proving it simply require higher math?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A related question is how would you discover L'Hopital's rule.  Assuming that $f(x) = g(x) = 0$, one might notice that \n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{f(x + h)}{g(x+h)} &= \\frac{\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}}{\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}} \\\\\n&\\approx \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n\\end{align}\nwhich suggests L'Hopital's rule.  This could be turned into a rigorous proof, but we'd need to make some unnecessarily restrictive assumptions. Here is a version of L'Hopital's rule with a simple proof:\nAssume $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x$ and $g'(x) \\neq 0$, and that $f(x) = g(x) = 0$.  Then \n\\begin{equation}\n\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)}{g(x+h)} = \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.\n\\end{equation} Proving a less restrictive version of L'Hopital's rule requires a less obvious argument.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this user's query. They want me to act as a bilingual math professor, structure a Math Stack Exchange question into a specific format, and provide an answer. The example given shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem from the user. The question is about proving L'Hospital's Rule, and the user is asking for a basic proof or if higher math is required. The title is \"Proof of L'Hospitals Rule\" and the question body expresses frustration about not finding a solid proof at a high school level.\n\nNow, applying the format: the assumptions should list each condition one by one. For L'Hospital's Rule, the typical assumptions are that the functions f and g are differentiable near a point a (except possibly at a), their limit as x approaches a is 0/0 or ±∞/±∞, the derivative of g isn't zero near a, and the limit of f'/g' exists.\n\nSo each of these should be separate assumptions. The problem statement is to prove L'Hospital's Rule under these conditions. I need to ensure that each assumption is a single line addressing one property. Then, the problem part is straightforward—proving the rule.\n\nI should check for any missing assumptions. For example, sometimes continuity at a might be implied, but in the standard L'Hospital's statement, differentiability around a and the limit form are key. The user's example had two assumptions, but here there are more. That's okay because the example was simpler. The key is to list all necessary conditions for the rule to apply.\n\nAlso, the original question mentions high school level knowledge. However, the proof of L'Hospital's Rule typically uses Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem, which might be beyond high school. But the task is to structure the problem, not to judge the difficulty. So just list the assumptions and the problem as is.\n\nNeed to make sure the problem is phrased correctly. The user might have a typo in \"L'Hospitals\" but it's standard as \"L'Hospital's Rule\". Also, ensure mathematical notation is correct if any, but the original problem doesn't have formulas, just the rule's name.\n\nSo putting it all together: list each assumption line by line, then the problem statement. That should meet the user's format requirements.",
