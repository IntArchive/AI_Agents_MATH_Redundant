    "Content": "For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections(C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear. I have a proof for the theorem, but I have not found any specific name for it. I searched \"inscribed squares in a triangle,\" and I still could not find the same shape. Can anyone provide a specific name for this, or a way that I can find the theorem online? For the similar question concerning the cubes inscribed in a tetrahedron, please visit Extend squares inscribed in a triangle to the cubes inscribed in a tetrahedron . Proof: $\\tan(\\angle ACB) = \\frac{IK}{KC}$ $\\because LG = IK$ $\\therefore \\frac{LG}{KC} = \\frac{IK}{KC} = \\tan(\\angle ACB)$ Similarly, $\\frac{LH}{JC} = \\tan(\\angle ACB)$ $\\because \\angle LHO = \\angle LGO = \\angle OLC = \\angle OKC = 90^{\\circ}$ $\\therefore \\angle JCK = \\angle GLH = 360^{\\circ} - \\angle LHO - \\angle LGO - \\angle GOH = 360^{\\circ} - \\angle OJC - \\angle OKC - \\angle JOK $ $\\because \\frac{LH}{JC} = \\frac{LG}{KC} = \\tan(\\angle ACB), \\angle JCK = \\angle GLH$ $\\therefore \\Delta LHG \\simeq \\Delta CJK $ (SAS) $\\therefore \\angle LGH = \\angle JKC$ $\\because \\angle LGO = \\angle OKC = 90^{\\circ}$ $\\therefore \\angle HGO = \\angle OKJ = \\angle LGO - \\angle LGH = \\angle OKC -\\angle JKC$ Similarly, $\\angle GHO = \\angle OJK$ $\\therefore \\Delta GOH \\simeq \\Delta KOJ$ (AA) $\\therefore \\frac{GH}{JK} = \\frac{LG}{KC}$ $\\therefore \\frac{GO}{OK} = \\frac{LG}{KC} = \\frac{GH}{JK}$ $\\because \\angle LGO = \\angle OKC$ $\\therefore \\Delta LGO \\simeq \\Delta CKO$ (SAS) $\\therefore \\angle GOL = \\angle KOC$ Similarly, $\\angle HOL = \\angle JOC$ $\\because \\angle IOJ = \\angle POK$ $\\therefore \\angle LOG + \\angle IOJ + \\angle JOC = \\angle COK + \\angle POK + \\angle HOL = \\frac{1}{2}(360^{\\circ}) = 180^{\\circ}$ $\\therefore$ Points C, O, L are collinear $Q.E.D$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In light of the Bailey and Detemple (B&T) article mentioned in @Larry's answer , I'm updating my response. See the Edit History for a previous version of this answer. As B&T describe, the key notion here is a general property of squares inscribed in angles ; having a square's vertex lie on the third side of a triangle is an unnecessary restriction. (That restriction would have some relevance if the three resulting lines of intersection for a triangle were concurrent; alas, they are not.)  But in fact, the property generalizes beyond squares to similar parallelograms . Visually, the result is clear: Articulating it in words is a little tricky. Bear with me. Definitions. Given an angle with side-lines $a$ and $b$ , we call a parallelogram \"inscribed with base-line $a$ \" if two adjacent vertices (the \"base vertices\") lie on $a$ and a third vertex lies on $b$ . We'll call the side-lines not parallel to $a$ the \"lateral lines\" of the parallelogram. Let an angle have vertex $O$ and side-lines $a$ and $b$ . Inscribe a parallelogram with base vertices $A$ and $A^\\prime$ on $a$ , and with $A^{\\prime\\prime}$ (adjacent to $A$ ) on $b$ ; let $A^\\star$ be the fourth vertex. Likewise, inscribe parallelogram $\\square B^\\prime B B^{\\prime\\prime} B^\\star$ with base-line $b$ . Theorem. If the parallelograms are similar and \"compatibly slanted\" (that is, if $\\square A^\\prime A A^{\\prime\\prime}A^\\star \\sim \\square B^\\prime B B^{\\prime\\prime} B^{\\star}$ , and $\\angle OAA^{\\prime\\prime}\\cong\\angle OBB^{\\prime\\prime}$ ), then $O$ is collinear with the points where the lateral lines through $A$ and $A^\\prime$ meet the respective lateral lines through $B$ and $B^\\prime$ . For proof, let the lateral lines through $A$ and $B$ meet at $P$ . Let $\\overleftrightarrow{OP}$ meet the lateral line through $A^\\prime$ at $P^\\prime$ . Via the similarity $\\triangle OAP \\sim OA^\\prime P^\\prime$ , we deduce $$\\frac{|PP^\\prime|}{|OP|} = \\frac{|AA^\\prime|}{|OA|} = \\frac{|AA^\\prime|}{|AA^{\\prime\\prime}|}\\frac{|AA^{\\prime\\prime}|}{|OA|} \\tag{1}$$ The parallelogram similarity allows us to re-write the first factor in $(1)$ , while $\\triangle OAA^{\\prime\\prime}\\sim\\triangle OBB^{\\prime\\prime}$ allows us to re-write the second: $$\\frac{|PP^\\prime|}{|OP|} = \\frac{|BB^\\prime|}{|BB^{\\prime\\prime}|}\\frac{|BB^{\\prime\\prime}|}{|OB|} \\tag{2}$$ We may conclude, then, that $P^\\prime$ lies on the lateral line through $B^\\prime$ , giving the Theorem. $\\square$ Note that the Theorem holds for arbitrary pairs of parallelograms inscribed in an angle; moreover, it holds whether $\\overrightarrow{PP^\\prime}$ points in the same or opposite direction as $\\overrightarrow{OP}$ . @Larry and B&T restrict the parallelograms to squares , and @Larry constrains the \"fourth vertices\" $A^\\star$ and $B^\\star$ to a third line (B&T consider that as a special case). They all also implicitly assume the \"same direction\" configuration, but here we see that the \"opposite direction\" case is equally valid: Here's a related (new?) result, for which I currently have only an ugly coordinate proof. A triangle admits three more \"inscribed\" squares; these have opposite vertices on a particular side-line, and one vertex on each other side-line. Given $\\triangle ABC$ , draw the new squares associated with sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CA}$ . The side-lines of the squares meet in four point-pairs , each of which are collinear with vertex $A$ . (The lines also meet in another eight points that seem to have no remarkable collinearity property.) In the figure, the four green lines show collinearity of top triangle vertex with four pairs of points-of-intersection of two squares' side-lines. When two lines meet at one of these points, the lines parallel to those lines meet at the other point of the pair. This result, too, generalizes to parallelograms that need not have \"fourth vertices\" constrained to a third line. Here's an image:",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question to extract the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe title is about a theorem related to inscribed squares in a triangle where certain points are collinear with a vertex. The user mentions that for any acute and right triangle, two intersections of the inscribed squares and the vertex are collinear. They also mention having a proof but not finding a specific name for the theorem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So, I need to identify all the conditions given in the problem. The key points here are:\n\n1. The triangle is acute or right.\n2. There are two inscribed squares.\n3. The intersections (points C and B) of these squares and vertex A are collinear.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So, the triangle is acute or right, and the collinear points are C, B, and A. But I need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question states: \"For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- There are two inscribed squares in the triangle.\n- The intersections of the two inscribed squares are points C and B.\n- Points C, B, and vertex A are collinear. Wait, no, the problem is stating that this collinearity is what needs to be proven, right? Wait, the user says they have a proof for the theorem, so the problem is to name the theorem, but the way the example is structured, the \"Problem\" part is the actual mathematical statement to prove or question to answer.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91). But in the current case, the user is not asking to prove the theorem but to find its name or reference. However, the example format seems to require structuring the problem as \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" parts, regardless of whether it's a proof or a naming question.\n\nWait, the original example was a proof problem. The current question is a reference request. However, the user still wants to format it into the same structure. So perhaps the \"Assumption\" part lists the conditions given in the theorem, and the \"Problem\" part is the actual question (i.e., asking for the name of the theorem given these conditions).\n\nLooking at the original problem statement: \"For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So the theorem's conditions are:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- Two inscribed squares are constructed in the triangle.\n- The intersections of these squares are points C and B.\n- Vertex A is part of the triangle.\n\nBut the problem is that the user wants to know the name of this theorem. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which the theorem holds, and the problem is to provide the name or find a reference.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include n being divisible by 7 unless there's a typo. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, that's their example, and we need to follow the structure they provided.\n\nIn the current case, the user's question is about a theorem that under certain conditions (acute or right triangle, two inscribed squares), certain points are collinear. The problem is to find the name of this theorem or a reference.\n\nBut according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be the actual problem. In the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". Here, the problem is \"What is the name of the theorem that states...\" but the user hasn't explicitly asked that. Wait, the original question is asking for the name of the theorem or a way to find it online. But according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be the problem statement, not the question about its name.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the original question.\n\nOriginal question: \"Is there a specific name for the following theorem? (Sides of inscribed squares of a triangle meet at points collinear with a vertex of the triangle). For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear. I have a proof for the theorem, but I have not found any specific name for it. [...] Can anyone provide a specific name for this, or a way that I can find the theorem online?\"\n\nSo the user is presenting a theorem and asking for its name. The theorem's statement is: For any acute and right triangle, two intersections of the inscribed squares and the vertex are collinear.\n\nTherefore, in the \"Assumption\" part, we need to list the conditions of the theorem. The theorem applies to acute and right triangles. The theorem involves two inscribed squares. The intersections of these squares (points C and B) and the vertex A are collinear. Wait, but in the theorem statement, the collinearity is the conclusion, not an assumption. Wait, no—the user is stating the theorem as \"For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections [...] and the vertex A [...] are collinear.\" So the theorem's hypotheses are that the triangle is acute or right, and the conclusion is that points C, B, A are collinear. Therefore, in the problem part, the user is asking for the name of this theorem. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- Two squares are inscribed in the triangle.\n- Points C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares.\n\nBut the collinearity is the conclusion, not an assumption. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility, and the assumptions were the conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Wait, but in that example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example was misformatted. Anyway, given that, for the current problem, the assumptions should be the conditions under which the theorem holds, which are:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- There are two inscribed squares in the triangle.\n\nBut the theorem's conclusion is that points C, B, and A are collinear. However, the problem here is not to prove the theorem but to find its name. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions (conditions) and the problem is to provide the name. But according to the user's example, the problem part is the mathematical statement to be proven. Wait, in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", which is the mathematical statement. Here, the problem is \"What is the name of the theorem that states...\", but the user hasn't phrased it that way. The user's question is asking for the name, but the theorem itself is the statement about collinearity. Therefore, perhaps the problem part should be the theorem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions. Then, the user's actual question (asking for the name) is beyond the formatted problem. But according to the instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes Assumption and Problem. The user's example had the problem as the mathematical statement to prove. Here, the problem is the theorem statement, and the user's actual question is to find its name, but the formatted problem part should just be the theorem statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the hypotheses of the theorem, and the problem is the conclusion. But the example's assumptions included both the general conditions (n is integer) and a specific condition (n divisible by 7), even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example is illustrative, and we need to follow the user's format even if it's inconsistent.\n\nIn the current case, the theorem is: For any acute and right triangle, two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A are collinear.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- There are two inscribed squares in the triangle.\n- The sides of the inscribed squares intersect at points C and B.\n\nWait, but points C and B are part of the triangle's vertices? Or are they intersections of the squares? The user wrote \"two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So vertex A is part of the triangle, and points C and B are intersections of the squares. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- Two squares are inscribed in the triangle.\n- The sides of the inscribed squares intersect at points C and B.\n- Vertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nBut the collinearity of C, B, and A is the conclusion. However, in the example, the problem part was the statement to prove. So here, the problem would be the conclusion: that C, B, and A are collinear. But the user's actual question is asking for the name of the theorem, which is not directly captured in the format. However, the instructions say to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and stating the problem. The example included the problem as the mathematical statement to prove. So here, the problem would be the collinearity statement, and the user's actual question (asking for the name) is outside of this format. But the user's instruction says to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem into the format. The original question includes both the theorem statement and the request for its name. So perhaps the formatted problem should encapsulate the theorem statement as the problem, and the assumptions are the conditions. Then, the user's request for the name is separate, but according to the example, the formatted problem only includes the mathematical problem, not the reference request.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the assumptions are the conditions of the theorem, and the problem is the mathematical statement to be proven (even if the user is asking for the name). So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is acute or right,\nTwo squares are inscribed in the triangle,\nPoints C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares,\nVertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nProblem: Prove that points C, B, and A are collinear.\n\nBut wait, the user's original problem states that \"two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So the problem is already stated as a theorem. Therefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions as the conditions (triangle type, inscribed squares) and the problem as the collinearity conclusion.\n\nBut I need to ensure that each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let me parse:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The triangle is acute.\n2. The triangle is right.\n3. Two squares are inscribed in the triangle.\n4. Points C and B are intersections of the two inscribed squares.\n5. Vertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nWait, but the triangle can be acute OR right, so maybe two separate assumptions: \"The triangle is acute or right\". But in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. However, in the original example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been a mistake. But perhaps in this case, \"The triangle is acute or right\" is one assumption.\n\nAlternatively, split into two:\n\n- The triangle is acute.\n- The triangle is right.\n\nBut the theorem applies to any triangle that is either acute or right. So combining them as one assumption: \"The triangle is acute or right\".\n\nAnother assumption: \"Two squares are inscribed in the triangle\". Then, \"Points C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares\". But the theorem states that these intersections and vertex A are collinear. So vertex A is part of the triangle, which is given. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The triangle is acute or right.\n- Two squares are inscribed in the triangle.\n- Points C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares.\n- Vertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nProblem: Points C, B, and A are collinear.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\". Here, the user has already proven it and is asking for the name, but the formatted problem should present the mathematical statement. So the problem would be \"Prove that points C, B, and A are collinear\" or \"Show that points C, B, and A are collinear\".\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking for the name, maybe the problem is \"What is the name of the theorem stating that points C, B, and A are collinear?\" But according to the example, the problem was the mathematical statement, not the question about the name. The example had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" as the problem. Therefore, here, the problem should be the mathematical conclusion: \"Prove that points C, B, and A are collinear\".\n\nBut the user's original question is not asking for the proof but the name. However, following the format provided, we need to structure the problem as assumptions and the mathematical problem, regardless of the user's actual request. Because the example took the original problem (prove divisibility) and structured it into assumptions and problem, even if the original problem had a different condition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is acute or right,\nTwo squares are inscribed in the triangle,\nPoints C and B are intersections of the inscribed squares,\nVertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nProblem: Prove that points C, B, and A are collinear.\n\nBut the user's original problem statement says \"two of the intersections (C and B) of the two inscribed squares and the vertex A of the triangle are collinear.\" So the problem is to show that these three points are collinear, given the triangle is acute or right with two inscribed squares.\n\nHowever, in the original question, the user included a proof, but that's part of the question's details, not the problem statement. So we need to filter out the proof and other unrelated information (like the reference to cubes in a tetrahedron) and focus on the core problem.\n\nSo final formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is acute or right,\nTwo squares are inscribed in the triangle,\nPoints C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares,\nVertex A is a vertex of the triangle.\n\nProblem: Prove that points C, B, and A are collinear.\n\nBut let me check if each assumption is one property applied to one object:\n\n1. The triangle is acute or right. (This is one condition on the triangle.)\n2. Two squares are inscribed in the triangle. (Condition on the triangle regarding the squares.)\n3. Points C and B are intersections of the sides of the inscribed squares. (Defines points C and B.)\n4. Vertex A is a vertex of the triangle. (Identifies vertex A.)\n\nEach is a single property applied to one object. So this should be correct.",
