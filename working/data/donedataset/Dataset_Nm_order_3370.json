    "Content": "I'm reading R. Courant & H. Robbins' \"What is Mathematics: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods\" for fun. I'm on page $60$ and $61$ of the second edition. There are three exercises on proving numbers irrational spanning these pages, the last is as follows. Exercise $3$ : Prove that $\\phi=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{5}$ is irrational. Try to make up similar and more general examples. My Attempt: Lemma: The number $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. (This is part of Exercise 2.) Proof: Suppose $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}=r$ is rational. Then $$\\begin{align}\n2&=(r-\\sqrt{3})^2 \\\\\n&=r^2-2r\\sqrt{3}+3\n\\end{align}$$ is rational, so that $$\\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r^2+1}{2r}$$ is rational, a contradiction. $\\square$ Let $\\psi=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ . Then, considering $\\phi$ , $$\\begin{align}\n5&=(\\phi-\\psi)^2 \\\\\n&=\\phi^2-2\\psi\\phi+5+2\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align}$$ I don't know what else to do from here.\nMy plan is/was to use the Lemma above as the focus for a contradiction, showing $\\psi$ is rational somehow. Please help :) Thoughts: The \"try to make up similar and more general examples\" bit is a little vague. The question is not answered here as far as I can tell.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Assume by contradiction that $\\psi=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{5}$ is rational. Then \n$$(\\psi-\\sqrt{5})^2=(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^2 \\\\\n\\psi^2-2\\sqrt{5}\\psi+5=5+2\\sqrt{6} \\\\\n\\psi^2=2\\sqrt{6} +2\\sqrt{5}\\psi\\\\\n$$ Square it one more time, and you reach the contradiction. For the general case, here is a nice trivial solution from Kvant: prove the following lemma: Lemma If $a_1,a_2,..,a_k$ are distinct integers $\\geq 2$, none of which is divisible by a square, and $b_1,..,b_n$ are integers such that \n$$b_1\\sqrt{a_1}+...+b_n\\sqrt{a_n} \\in \\mathbb Q$$\nthen $b_1=...=b_n=0$. Proof: Do induction by the number $m$ of primes which divide $a_1...a_n$. The inductive step $P(m)\\Rightarrow P(m+1)$ is done by contradiction: move all terms for which $a_k$ is divisible by the $p_{m+1}$ on one side, everything else on the other side and square, to end in the case $P_m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's instructions. The original problem is about proving that √2 + √3 + √5 is irrational and generalizing it. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The main object here is φ = √2 + √3 + √5. The problem wants to prove that φ is irrational. The user also mentioned generalizing this, but the main problem is about φ.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user tried using a lemma that √2 + √3 is irrational. Then they considered φ and squared it, getting an equation involving ψ (which is √2 + √3) and ended up with an expression that includes √6. But the key assumptions here are the definitions and properties of the numbers involved. \n\nSo, the assumptions should list each square root term and their sum. But wait, the problem statement itself is to prove that the sum is irrational. The only explicit assumptions are that each of the numbers √2, √3, √5 are irrational, but the problem is about their sum. However, in the example provided, the assumption included conditions on the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about a specific number made from sums of square roots. \n\nWait, maybe there are no explicit assumptions given other than the definition of φ. The problem is to prove that φ is irrational. The user's attempt uses the lemma that √2 + √3 is irrational, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem itself doesn't state any conditions on φ other than its definition. So perhaps the assumption here is simply the definition of φ as the sum of those three square roots. But the example given included assumptions about the variable n. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the user had to note that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are about the terms in φ. But the problem is to prove irrationality. Maybe the only assumption is that φ is defined as the sum of those three square roots. But perhaps more precisely, the problem assumes that √2, √3, √5 are irrational, but that's known and might not need to be listed. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n. Here, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the definition of φ. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question states: Prove that φ = √2 + √3 + √5 is irrational. Generalize this. The user's attempt uses the lemma that √2 + √3 is irrational. But the problem itself doesn't state any conditions on φ except its definition. So perhaps the assumption is just that φ is equal to the sum of those three roots. So the assumption line would be: φ = √2 + √3 + √5. Then the problem is to prove φ is irrational.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, φ is defined as the sum. So maybe the assumption is just φ = √2 + √3 + √5. Then the problem is to prove that φ is irrational. However, in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, which are two separate assumptions. Here, perhaps there's only one assumption: φ is defined as the sum. But maybe the problem also assumes that √2, √3, √5 are irrational, but those are known properties. However, the problem may not state those as assumptions because they're given as known. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is presented as \"Prove that √2 + √3 + √5 is irrational.\" So the only explicit assumption is the definition of φ. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be φ = √2 + √3 + √5, and the problem is to prove that φ is irrational. But maybe the problem also assumes that each individual square root is irrational. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variable n (integer, divisible by 7). Here, the variables are the square roots, but their irrationality is part of known mathematics, not an assumption. So perhaps the only assumption is the definition of φ. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that √2, √3, √5 are irrational, but that's standard. However, the user's example didn't include the irrationality of the numbers in the assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7. So the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the problem is about a specific number, so maybe the only assumption is φ's definition. But maybe the problem requires no assumptions beyond that. Wait, but perhaps the problem's assumptions are the components of φ. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to prove that φ is irrational, given that it's the sum of those three irrationals. The user's lemma that √2 + √3 is irrational is part of their attempt. The problem itself doesn't state any conditions except the definition. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption should be φ = √2 + √3 + √5, and the problem is to prove φ is irrational. The generalizing part is mentioned in the original problem but the user's example included only the specific problem. Since the user's example included the problem as given, perhaps the formatted problem here should list the assumption as φ being the sum, and the problem as proving it's irrational. The \"generalise\" part might be considered part of the problem, but the user's example didn't include \"generalise\" in the problem statement. Wait, in the original example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The original problem here is \"Prove that sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+sqrt(5) is irrational. Generalise this.\" So in the formatted version, should the problem include the \"Generalise this\" part? The user's example only included the specific problem. The original example's formatted problem included the specific problem. Therefore, in this case, the problem would be \"Prove that √2 + √3 + √5 is irrational. Generalise this.\" But perhaps the user wants to filter out the \"Generalise\" part. Wait, looking at the user's example, they included the problem as given but removed some parts. The original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" but the formatted problem included the assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe in this case, the problem should include both parts: proving the specific sum is irrational and generalizing it. However, the user's example split the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The \"Generalise this\" might be part of the problem. Let me check the example again. The example's original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, and the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So in that case, the problem was made more specific by the assumptions. Here, the original problem is to prove that φ is irrational and to generalise. However, the user's attempt focuses on the specific case. The problem statement might need to be split into assumptions and the problem. But since the problem includes both the specific case and the generalisation, perhaps the formatted problem should include both. But in the example, the general problem was made specific via assumptions. Here, the problem has two parts: prove φ is irrational and generalise. However, the user's example might suggest that the main problem is the first part, and the generalisation is an additional part. But the user wants the problem structured as per their format. Since the user's example includes only the specific problem in the formatted part (even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but they added assumptions on n), maybe here we should take the specific problem and list assumptions. However, in this case, the only assumption is φ's definition. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: φ = √2 + √3 + √5\n\nProblem: Prove that φ is irrational. Generalise this.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So φ is defined as the sum. Then the problem is to prove it's irrational and generalise. However, the generalise part may be considered part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just \"Prove that φ is irrational\" and the \"Generalise this\" is additional, but in the original problem, it's part of the problem statement. The user's example included the problem as given, modifying assumptions. So perhaps the formatted problem should include both parts. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: φ = √2 + √3 + √5\n\nProblem: Prove that φ is irrational. Generalise this.\n\nBut the example's problem part was only the main statement. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, leading to the problem being to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the original problem is to prove φ is irrational and generalise. Since the generalise part is part of the problem, maybe it's included. Alternatively, perhaps the generalise part is considered a separate task and might be excluded. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the given format, which includes the problem part. Therefore, I should include both parts in the problem statement. Hence, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: φ = √2 + √3 + √5\n\nProblem: Prove that φ is irrational. Generalise this.\n\nBut maybe the problem should be split into two separate problems? However, the user's example didn't split the problem. They took the original problem, added assumptions (n is integer and divisible by 7), and restated the problem. Here, the original problem is \"Prove that sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+sqrt(5) is irrational. Generalise this.\" So the formatted version would list the assumption as the definition of φ and then the problem as the two parts. Alternatively, if the Generalise part is considered separate, maybe it's omitted. But the user wants the problem as per the original. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: φ = √2 + √3 + √5\n\nProblem: Prove that φ is irrational. Generalise this.\n\nYes, that seems right. The assumption defines φ, and the problem is to prove its irrationality and generalise. Even though \"Generalise this\" is vague, it's part of the original problem statement. So following the example, the problem part includes the entire original problem statement, filtered of unrelated information. The original problem's title and question mention the generalisation, so it's part of the problem.",
