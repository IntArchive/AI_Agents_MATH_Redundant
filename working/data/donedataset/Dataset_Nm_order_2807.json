    "Content": "Prove if $n$ has a primitive root, then it has exactly $\\phi(\\phi(n))$ of them. Let $a$ be the primitive root then I know other primitive roots will be among $\\{a,a^2,a^3 \\cdots\\cdots a^{\\phi(n)} \\}$ because any other number will be congruent modulo $n$ to one of these.\nThen I figured as the answer is $\\phi(\\phi(n))$ so for $a^k$ to be primitive root, $k$ must be coprime with $\\phi(n)$.But I don't know the reason.Am I missing any silly point?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: If $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$ generated by an element $g$, then the order of the element $g^m$ is $n/\\gcd(m,n)$ (you should have seen this result shortly after cyclic groups were introduced). In particular $g^m$ is of order $n$, if and only if $\\gcd(m,n)=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if n has a primitive root, then it has exactly φ(φ(n)) of them. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that n has a primitive root. So the first assumption is that n has at least one primitive root. Then, the user mentions that a is a primitive root, and other primitive roots are among the powers of a up to a^φ(n). The key point here is that for a^k to be a primitive root, k must be coprime with φ(n). The problem is to prove the number of primitive roots is φ(φ(n)). \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they had an assumption like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the original problem says \"if n has a primitive root\", so that's a conditional. So the assumption here would be that n has a primitive root. Also, the problem is to show that the number of primitive roots is φ(φ(n)). \n\nBut the user's question also mentions that they figured out that a^k must have k coprime with φ(n), but they don't understand why. So perhaps the assumptions should include that a is a primitive root modulo n, and that other primitive roots are in the set {a, a², ..., a^φ(n)}. Wait, but those might not be assumptions but part of the reasoning. \n\nWait, the task is to filter the original problem and structure it. The original question is: \"Prove if n has a primitive root, then it has exactly φ(φ(n)) of them.\" So the main assumption is that n has a primitive root. Then the problem is to show the count is φ(φ(n)). \n\nThe user also mentions that they considered that primitive roots are among the powers of a primitive root a, and that k must be coprime with φ(n). But that's part of the reasoning steps, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions are the given conditions. So in the problem statement, the only assumption is that n has a primitive root. The rest is part of the problem to prove. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no. The example original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original example problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, but the problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the example formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But that seems like an error, unless the original problem was misrepresented. Wait, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the example provided by the user might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to show that when n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But given that 91 is 7*13, maybe the original problem had n being an integer, but the conclusion is divisibility by 91, which requires both 7 and 13. However, maybe in the example, the user filtered out that n is divisible by 7, but that's part of the problem's solution. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, the task is to structure the problem with assumptions. For the current problem, the original question is: Prove if n has a primitive root, then it has exactly φ(φ(n)) of them. So the assumption here is that n has a primitive root. The problem is to prove the number is φ(φ(n)). \n\nBut in the example, they included additional assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that n has a primitive root, which implies that n must be 1, 2, 4, p^k, or 2p^k for an odd prime p and integer k ≥1. But maybe that's part of the theorem, not the assumption here. Wait, the problem is stated as \"if n has a primitive root, then...\", so the only assumption is that n has a primitive root. Therefore, the assumption should be \"n has a primitive root\". \n\nBut perhaps the user wants the necessary conditions for n to have primitive roots as assumptions. Wait, but the problem is not about when n has primitive roots, but given that n has at least one, to count them. So the main assumption is that n has a primitive root. The rest is part of the problem's proof. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: n has a primitive root.\n\nProblem: Prove that n has exactly φ(φ(n)) primitive roots.\n\nWait, but the user's example had two assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe the user's example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to list all implicit assumptions. But according to the original problem statement, the only explicit assumption is that n has a primitive root. \n\nThe user's example might have been structured with some misunderstanding. For instance, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would actually make the problem's conclusion trivial, since 91 is 7*13. But perhaps the user intended that n must satisfy certain conditions. However, in the given example, the original problem didn't state any such conditions, so maybe the example was incorrect. \n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the correct assumption is that n has a primitive root. The problem is to prove the count is φ(φ(n)). Therefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: n has a primitive root\nProblem: Prove that n has exactly $\\phi(\\phi(n))$ primitive roots",
