    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given integral problem into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The integral is from 0 to π/3 of arccos(2 sin²x - cos x) dx, and it's supposed to equal π²/5. The user mentions numerical evidence and some attempts like integration by parts, substitution, Maclaurin series, but it didn't work. Also, there's a note about the graph intersecting the axes at (π/3,0) and (0,π). Another integral with arccos squared is mentioned, but that's probably an extra and not part of the main problem.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove that the integral equals π²/5. Now, the assumptions. The original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions beyond the integral limits and the function inside arccos. But wait, arccos has a domain of [-1,1]. So I should check if 2 sin²x - cos x is within [-1,1] for x in [0, π/3]. Let me verify that.\n\nFor x in [0, π/3], sin²x ranges from 0 to sin²(π/3) ≈ (sqrt(3)/2)² = 3/4. So 2 sin²x ranges up to 3/2. Then 2 sin²x - cos x. The cos x term ranges from 1 (at x=0) to 0.5 (at x=π/3). So let's compute the expression at x=0: 2*0 - 1 = -1. At x=π/3: 2*(3/4) - 0.5 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1. So between x=0 and π/3, the expression inside arccos goes from -1 to 1. So it's valid. Hence, the function is defined on the interval. Therefore, the integrand is valid over the entire interval. So the assumptions here are about the domain of the integrand being valid. But since the problem is presented as given, perhaps the user assumes that the integral is well-defined. Maybe the problem itself doesn't require stating those assumptions, but in the format example, they listed assumptions like n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, maybe the only assumption is the limits of integration and the integrand's validity. Wait, but in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. That would actually change the problem. That's a problem. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong. But in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to π/3, and the function inside arccos is valid there. But the problem as stated doesn't have any other conditions. So maybe the assumptions here are just the interval [0, π/3] and the integrand's validity. Wait, but in the example, they broke down assumptions line by line. For this problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/3,\nThe argument of arccos, 2 sin²x - cos x, lies in [-1, 1] for all x in [0, π/3].\n\nBut maybe the original problem already ensures that, so perhaps the user doesn't need to list those. Alternatively, maybe the problem as stated has no additional assumptions beyond the integral setup. The example given might have been incorrectly formatted. Wait, perhaps the user intended to extract only the key assumptions from the problem. The original example had a mistake where the problem was to prove for all integers n, but the formatted problem added that n must be divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list the inherent assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem to make sense.\n\nIn this case, the integral is from 0 to π/3, and the integrand involves arccos(2 sin²x - cos x). The key assumption here is that the expression inside arccos is within its domain [-1,1] for all x in [0, π/3]. As we checked earlier, at x=0, it's -1, and at x=π/3, it's 1, and in between, perhaps it stays within that range. So that's an important assumption. Also, the function is integrable over that interval, but that's generally assumed unless there are discontinuities or singularities, which there aren't here. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/3].\n2. For all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ∈ [-1, 1].\n\nBut the original problem didn't state these explicitly; they are inherent to the problem's validity. However, in the example provided by the user, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem but was necessary for the conclusion. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", but that would change the problem to only when n is a multiple of 7, which is not what the original problem stated. That seems like an error. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, and we should not follow it strictly. Instead, the correct approach is to list any assumptions necessary for the problem to hold, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn this case, the integral's validity requires that the argument of arccos is in its domain. So that's an essential assumption. Therefore, we should list that. However, the user's example might have been incorrect, so perhaps the intended structure is to list explicit assumptions from the problem statement. Wait, the original problem says \"Show that the integral from 0 to π/3... equals π²/5\". There are no stated assumptions except the limits. But the function inside arccos must be valid. So perhaps the user's intended structure requires breaking down the problem's conditions, even if they are implicit. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is computed from 0 to π/3.\n- The expression inside the arccos, 2 sin²x - cos x, is within the domain [-1, 1] for all x in [0, π/3].\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as a single line addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/3],\nFor each x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x is in the domain of arccos.\n\nAlternatively, more precisely:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, π/3],\n2 sin²x - cos x is in [-1, 1] for all x in [0, π/3].\n\nBut the problem statement itself includes the integral from 0 to π/3, so the first assumption is redundant. Wait, but in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's statement. The original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. So in this case, the integral's limits are part of the problem statement, so maybe the assumption here is that x ranges from 0 to π/3, and the expression inside arccos is valid. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe expression 2 sin²x - cos x lies within the domain [-1, 1].\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement already specifies x from 0 to π/3, so the first assumption is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, the user's example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in this problem, the integral being from 0 to π/3 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that the argument of arccos is valid, which is required for the function to be defined. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ∈ [-1, 1].\n\nBut how to split into line by line, each addressing one property of one object. Since the validity of the expression inside arccos is a single condition, even though it's for all x in the interval. But maybe the user's format requires each line to be a separate assumption, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x is greater than or equal to -1,\nFor each x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x is less than or equal to 1.\n\nBut that's splitting the domain condition into two parts. However, in the example, the user listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Therefore, in this case, maybe the only assumption is that the expression inside arccos is in [-1,1], but since it's part of the problem's validity, maybe the problem doesn't have any additional assumptions beyond what's stated. Wait, but the problem statement doesn't mention anything about the domain of arccos; it's just given. So perhaps the problem as stated assumes that the integrand is valid, so the user doesn't need to list it as an assumption. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as presented in the question has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup, so the assumptions section would be empty. But the example shows that even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, following that, even if it's part of the problem statement, we should list it as an assumption. So in this case, the integral is from 0 to π/3, so the assumption is that x is in [0, π/3], and the expression inside arccos is valid. But the problem statement already states the integral from 0 to π/3, so perhaps the only assumption is the validity of the integrand. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ∈ [-1, 1].\n\nBut to split into separate lines as per the example, where each line is one property applied to one object. Since the expression's lower bound and upper bound are separate conditions, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≥ -1,\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≤ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So if there are multiple conditions, each should be a separate line. Therefore, here, the two inequalities would be separate assumptions. However, in reality, these are two parts of the same domain condition. But following the example's structure, perhaps each inequality is a separate assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require listing these assumptions because the original problem statement presents the integral as valid, and the user is to take it as given. The example might have included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which was incorrect, but perhaps the user intended to show that assumptions are to be listed even if they are part of the problem's premise. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the user's example structure. The original example had the problem statement: \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under Assumption lists: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts n. That seems like an error. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the conditions that are part of the problem statement as assumptions. So in the original problem here, the integral is from 0 to π/3, so the assumption is that x ranges from 0 to π/3. Additionally, the integrand is valid (arccos argument in [-1,1]), which is an implicit assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, π/3],\nThe expression 2 sin²x - cos x is within the domain of arccos function for all x in [0, π/3].\n\nBut again, split into two lines if needed. Alternatively, since the domain of arccos is [-1,1], perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], -1 ≤ 2 sin²x - cos x ≤ 1.\n\nBut to split into two lines:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≥ -1,\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≤ 1.\n\nBut I need to check if both inequalities hold. Earlier, we saw that at x=0, it's -1; at x=π/3, it's 1. Let's check x=π/6: sin²(π/6) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so 2*(1/4) = 1/2. cos(π/6) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1/2 - 0.866 ≈ -0.366, which is ≥ -1. Similarly, what's the maximum of 2 sin²x - cos x in [0, π/3]? Let's compute derivative to find maxima. Let f(x) = 2 sin²x - cos x. f’(x) = 4 sinx cosx + sinx. Setting to zero: sinx (4 cosx +1) =0. So sinx=0 or 4 cosx +1=0. sinx=0 in [0, π/3] only at x=0. 4 cosx +1=0 → cosx= -1/4, but x is in [0, π/3] where cosx ≥ 0.5, so no solution. Therefore, maximum occurs at endpoints. At x=0, f(x)= -1; at x=π/3, f(x)=1. So f(x) increases from -1 to 1. Therefore, 2 sin²x - cos x ranges from -1 to 1 in [0, π/3], hence always within [-1,1]. Therefore, the expression is valid. Hence, the assumptions are satisfied. So perhaps the problem doesn't require listing these since they are automatically satisfied, but according to the user's example, even inherent conditions are listed as assumptions. Therefore, I should include them.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is in the interval [0, π/3],\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≥ -1,\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^{\\pi/3}\\arccos\\left(2\\sin^{2}x -\\cos x\\right)\\mathrm dx = \\frac{\\pi^{2}}{5}.$$\n\nBut the user's example listed assumptions even if they were part of the problem's premise, like n is an integer. So perhaps the integral's interval is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Hence, the only assumptions are the validity of the arccos argument. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x is in [-1, 1].\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So split into two:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≥ -1,\nFor all x in [0, π/3], 2 sin²x - cos x ≤ 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer would be structured as such.",
