    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the user's specified format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"An interesting inequality ∑_{k=1}^n 1/(n+k) < sqrt(2)/2, n≥1\". The user is asking how to prove this inequality without using calculus, since the original proof uses calculus concepts like taking the limit as n approaches infinity, which involves knowing that the limit is ln(2). The example given in the problem uses a limit involving calculus, but the user wants a method that doesn't rely on that.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states the inequality holds for n ≥ 1. So one assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. The other part of the problem is the inequality itself: the sum from k=1 to n of 1/(n+k) is less than sqrt(2)/2. \n\nWait, the example provided by the user had assumptions listed as individual properties. In their example, the original problem mentioned n being an integer and also that n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the only explicit condition given is n ≥ 1. Are there any other implicit assumptions here? The sum is from k=1 to n, so n must be a positive integer. The problem states n ≥ 1, so n is an integer, but maybe we should specify that n is a positive integer. However, sometimes in inequalities, n can be a real number, but in this case, since the sum is from k=1 to n, n must indeed be a positive integer. So the assumptions are that n is a positive integer, specifically n ≥ 1.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"for n≥1\", so we can take that as the main assumption. The problem is to prove that the sum is less than sqrt(2)/2 without using calculus. So the formatted problem should list the assumption as \"n is an integer greater than or equal to 1\" and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had each assumption as separate lines. So in their example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate. In this current problem, the key assumption is \"n is an integer greater than or equal to 1\". But maybe it's better to split that into two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\". But according to the problem statement, the original question mentions \"n≥1\", so perhaps that's the main condition. Alternatively, sometimes inequalities might hold for real numbers, but in this case, since the sum is over k=1 to n, n has to be an integer. So maybe \"n is a positive integer\" is sufficient, but to match the problem's phrasing, perhaps \"n is an integer greater than or equal to 1\".\n\nBut in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, perhaps \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥ 1\" would be separate lines. Let me check the original problem again. The original problem's title says \"n≥1\", and the question mentions \"n≥1\". So the assumptions are that n is an integer (since the sum is from 1 to n, which requires n to be integer) and n ≥ 1. So the Assumption section should list these two points separately.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{n+k} < \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$$.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title includes \"n≥1\", and the problem statement in the question says \"How would you prove it without calculus?\" referring to the inequality. The key here is that the user wants to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions would include all conditions given. The example given had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7, even though in the original problem statement, it was written as \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted problem included the divisibility by 7. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake there. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the correct assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, it added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not part of the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a typo or a mistake by the user. But regardless, in the current problem, I need to follow the user's format as per their example, even if the example might have an error. However, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps in the example, the original problem might have mentioned something else, but the user restructured it with the correct assumptions. But given that in the current problem, the only conditions are that n is an integer ≥1, so the assumptions should list that n is an integer and n ≥1. Alternatively, maybe n is a positive integer, which combines both. But according to the user's example, each assumption is one line, addressing one property applied to one object. So perhaps splitting into \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥1\" would be better. However, in the original problem's title, it's written as \"n≥1\", which is a single condition. Hmm. But in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps here, \"n is an integer\" and \"n ≥1\" should be separate assumptions. So that's two assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \"for n ≥1\", where n is an integer. So the user's example included the divisibility by 7, which might have been part of the problem. Wait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a miscommunication. But perhaps the example is an illustration, and we should follow the instruction regardless. Therefore, for the current problem, since the original problem states n ≥1 and the sum is from k=1 to n, which implies n is an integer. So the assumptions are: n is an integer, and n ≥1. Then the problem is to prove the inequality. So that's the structure. Let me check the problem again. The title is \"An interesting inequality ∑_{k=1}^n 1/(n+k) < sqrt(2)/2, n≥1\", and the question mentions \"n≥1\". So the user wants to structure it as: Assumption: n is an integer, n ≥1. Problem: Prove that the sum is less than sqrt(2)/2. That's it. So the answer should follow this structure.",
