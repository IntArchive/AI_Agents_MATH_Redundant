    "Content": "In The Many Lives of Lattice Theory Gian-Carlo Rota says the following. Necessary and sufficient conditions on a commutative\nring are known that insure the validity\nof the Chinese remainder theorem. There is, however,\none necessary and sufficient condition that\nplaces the theorem in proper perspective. It states\nthat the Chinese remainder theorem holds in a\ncommutative ring if and only if the lattice of ideals\nof the ring is distributive. The essay can be found here , and the quotation comes from the third page in the file. I know the following version of the Chinese remainder theorem for rings (not necessarily commutative). Suppose $R$ is a ring and $A,A_1, \\ldots,A_k$ are ideals of $R.$ If $(1)$ $A_1 \\cap \\ldots \\cap A_k = A,$ and $(2)$ $A_i + A_j = R$ for all $1 \\leq i < j \\leq k,$ then $R/A \\cong R/A_1\\times\\ldots\\times R/A_k$ via an isomorphism which is both a ring isomorphism and an $R$ -module isomorphism. This version of the theorem comes from these lecture notes ( Wayback Machine ). Clearly, there are some lattice-theoretic conditions on the ideals here, but I don't understand what G.C. Rota means by \"the Chinese remainder theorem\". He cannot mean this version because it holds for any rings. Could you give me the exact wording of the theorem he mentions? Also, can I find its proof anywhere? And if it's possible, could you explain to me why (or if) commutativity is important in the theorem he mentions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I discussed this with Rota, so I can assure you that he refers to Prüfer domains. They are non-Noetherian generalizations of Dedekind domains. Their ubiquity stems from a remarkable confluence of interesting characterizations. For example, they are those domains satisfying either the Chinese Remainder Theorem for ideals, or Gauss's Lemma for polynomial content ideals, or for ideals: $\\rm\\ A\\cap (B + C) = A\\cap B + A\\cap C\\:,\\  $ or $\\rm\\ (A + B)\\ (A \\cap B) = A\\ B\\:,\\ $ or $\\rm\\ A\\supset B\\ \\Rightarrow\\ A\\:|\\:B\\ $ for fin. gen. $\\rm\\:A\\:$ etc. It's been estimated that there are close to 100 such characterizations known, e.g. see my  2008/11/19 sci.math post for 30 odd characterizations.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and distributive lattices, referencing a statement by Gian-Carlo Rota. The user wants this structured into Assumptions and Problem sections, similar to the example provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question to extract the key elements. The user mentions that Rota states CRT holds in a commutative ring if and only if the lattice of ideals is distributive. The question then asks for clarification on the exact theorem Rota refers to, its proof, and the role of commutativity.\n\nIn the example given, assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. Here, the main conditions are that the ring is commutative and that the lattice of ideals is distributive. The problem is to understand the necessary and sufficient condition for CRT to hold, which Rota claims is the distributivity of the ideal lattice.\n\nI need to list each assumption on a separate line. The first assumption is that the ring is commutative. The second is that the lattice of ideals is distributive. The problem part should ask for the proof or the statement of the theorem that CRT holds if and only if the lattice is distributive.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on 'n' (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions would be about the ring: commutative and the lattice of ideals being distributive. But actually, Rota's statement is that CRT holds iff the lattice is distributive, given the ring is commutative. Wait, no—the original quote says \"commutative ring\" but doesn't specify if the ring is already assumed commutative. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user quotes Rota: \"the Chinese remainder theorem holds in a commutative ring if and only if the lattice of ideals of the ring is distributive.\" So the theorem is for commutative rings. Therefore, the commutativity is part of the ring's assumption, and the condition is distributivity of the ideal lattice. So the problem is to prove that in a commutative ring, CRT holds iff the lattice of ideals is distributive.\n\nBut the original question is asking for the exact wording of the theorem, the proof, and why commutativity is important. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture the essence of what needs to be proved, based on Rota's statement.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- The lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nBut actually, the theorem is an equivalence. So maybe the problem is to show that in a commutative ring, CRT holds if and only if the lattice of ideals is distributive. Therefore, the assumptions would include that R is commutative, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to apply to one object. So R is a commutative ring is one assumption. Then, the problem is to prove that CRT holds (in R) if and only if the lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were about 'n' being an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n\nBecause Rota's statement is about commutative rings. Then the problem is to prove that CRT holds in R if and only if the lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions the user's version of CRT for not necessarily commutative rings, which doesn't require distributivity. Hence, the question is why commutativity is important in Rota's version.\n\nSo putting this all together, the formatted problem should have the assumption that R is commutative, and the problem is to prove the equivalence between CRT holding and the lattice being distributive. But perhaps the problem is to state and prove the theorem Rota mentions, given that R is commutative.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking for the exact wording and proof, the problem part could be to state the theorem and explain why commutativity is required.\n\nBut following the example format, the user wants the problem to be structured into assumptions and problem. The example had two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem to prove A(n) divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the assumption is that R is a commutative ring. The problem is to prove that CRT holds in R if and only if the lattice of ideals is distributive.\n\nWait, but Rota's statement is in the context of commutative rings, so the assumption is that R is commutative. Then the problem is to establish the equivalence between CRT and distributivity.\n\nBut the original problem also mentions that the user knows a version of CRT for non-commutative rings, so they're confused why Rota's statement requires commutativity. Therefore, the problem is likely to understand under what conditions CRT holds in commutative rings, which requires distributivity.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds in R if and only if the lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nBut the original quote says \"necessary and sufficient condition that places the theorem in proper perspective... if and only if the lattice of ideals is distributive.\" So the problem is to prove that equivalence. The assumption is R is commutative, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nSo the final formatted answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds in R if and only if the lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nBut wait, does Rota's statement require the ring to be commutative, and then the distributivity is the condition? Or is the distributivity the condition regardless of commutativity?\n\nThe original quote says \"commutative ring\" so the assumption is that the ring is commutative. Then the problem is to show that CRT holds iff the lattice is distributive. Therefore, the assumptions should include that R is commutative, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds in R if and only if the lattice of ideals of R is distributive.\n\nI think that's it. The user's example had two assumptions, but in this case, the main assumption is the ring being commutative. The problem is the equivalence to distributivity of the ideal lattice.",
