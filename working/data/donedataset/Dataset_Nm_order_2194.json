    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about proving an inequality for a function f that's continuously differentiable on [0, π], with the integral of f over [0, π] being zero. The goal is to show that the absolute value of f at any point x in [0, π] is bounded by the square root of (π/3) times the integral of the square of its derivative. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The user provided an example where they structured the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem statement. So I need to extract the assumptions from the original question. Let me look at the original problem again:\n\n\"Let $f\\in C^1([0,\\pi],\\mathbb R)$ such that $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt=0$. Prove that $\\forall x\\in [0,\\pi],\\displaystyle|f(x)|\\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\int_0^\\pi f'^2(t)dt}$\"\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is in C^1([0, π], R), meaning it's continuously differentiable on the interval [0, π].\n2. The integral of f from 0 to π is zero.\n3. The problem is to prove the inequality for all x in [0, π].\n\nWait, the user's example for the previous problem listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the original problem mentioned that n is an integer and then added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, in the original problem, the example was given where the user restructured the problem and included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But in the problem here, the user's example for the previous problem actually had a different structure. Wait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user's example seems to have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like maybe an error? Or perhaps the example was for a different problem where that assumption was present. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the instruction is to follow their format.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is:\n\nLet $f\\in C^1([0,\\pi],\\mathbb R)$ such that $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt=0$. Prove that $\\forall x\\in [0,\\pi],\\displaystyle|f(x)|\\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\int_0^\\pi f'^2(t)dt}$.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is in C^1([0, π], R). So f is a continuously differentiable function on [0, π].\n2. The integral of f over [0, π] is zero.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for all x in [0, π], |f(x)| is bounded by that expression involving the integral of the square of the derivative.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they split the assumptions into separate lines, each for one property. So in the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a continuously differentiable function on the interval $[0, \\pi]$,\n$f$ is real-valued,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"$f\\in C^1([0,\\pi],\\mathbb R)$\", which already includes that f is real-valued and continuously differentiable. So perhaps each of these should be separate assumptions. However, in the example given, they separated \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the problem here, the user's example might be a bit inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is wrong, but the instruction is to follow it regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was correct in the sense that the original problem had an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated but was part of the problem's context. Wait, the original example's formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but the original problem was to prove for every integer n that A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the example was to correct it by adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But perhaps that's not relevant here.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, we need to extract all the assumptions from the original question. The original problem says:\n\n\"Let $f\\in C^1([0,\\pi],\\mathbb R)$ such that $\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt=0$.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f belongs to C^1([0, π], R), which means it's a continuously differentiable function from [0, π] to R.\n2. The integral of f over [0, π] is zero.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality for all x in [0, π].\n\nTherefore, in the Assumption section, each of these should be listed line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is a continuously differentiable function on $[0, \\pi]$,\n$f$ is real-valued,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nWait, but the C^1([0, π], R) already implies that f is real-valued and continuously differentiable. So maybe we can combine that into one line: $f \\in C^1([0, \\pi], \\mathbb{R})$. But in the example provided by the user, they broke down the assumptions into separate lines, even if they were part of the same statement. For example, in their example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, that seems like the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been an error in their example. But since the user provided that example, I need to follow their format, even if it's not accurate. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that in the example, the original problem had a mistake and they corrected it by adding the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's speculative. Given that, for the current problem, I should extract the assumptions as per the original problem, which are:\n\n1. f is in C^1([0, π], R).\n2. The integral of f over [0, π] is zero.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each of these is a separate line. However, the first assumption (f in C^1) includes two things: the function is continuously differentiable and real-valued. But according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps we need to break down the first assumption into two:\n\n1. $f$ is continuously differentiable on $[0, \\pi]$,\n2. $f$ is real-valued,\n3. $\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nBut technically, stating that f is in C^1([0, π], R) combines both the differentiability and the codomain being real numbers. However, following the user's example where they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\", perhaps in their example they erroneously split it, but following that, here we should split the conditions. Alternatively, maybe not. It's a bit unclear. \n\nBut let me check: in the user's example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", which would translate to the assumption \"n is an integer\". However, in their formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps that was an error. But the user might have intended to show that in some cases, assumptions need to be listed even if they are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example was for a different problem where that assumption was present. Given that, perhaps I should follow the structure as per the user's instruction, even if their example seems inconsistent.\n\nBut for the current problem, the original problem says \"Let f in C^1([0,π], R) such that integral of f is zero\". Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is in C^1([0, π], R) (which includes being continuously differentiable and real-valued),\n2. The integral of f over [0, π] is zero.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they might split these into separate lines. However, the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are two separate conditions, not parts of a single statement. Therefore, in this case, since the original problem states that f is in C^1([0, π], R) and has integral zero, those are two separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is an element of $C^1([0, \\pi], \\mathbb{R})$,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nAlternatively, to break down the first assumption into being continuously differentiable and real-valued:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is continuously differentiable on the interval $[0, \\pi]$,\n$f$ is real-valued,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nBut technically, $C^1([0, π], \\mathbb{R})$ already implies both that f is continuously differentiable and that it's real-valued. However, the user's example seems to separate properties even if they are part of the same mathematical object. For example, in their example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So perhaps here, even though being in C^1([0, π], R) is a single statement, we should split it into two assumptions: one about differentiability and one about being real-valued. But that might be over-splitting. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that each assumption is a separate clause in the problem statement. So if the problem says \"Let f in C^1([0, π], R) such that integral f =0\", then the two assumptions are:\n\n1. f ∈ C^1([0, π], R)\n2. ∫₀^π f(t) dt = 0\n\nTherefore, in the Assumption section, these two points.\n\nSo I think the correct way is to list the two assumptions as separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is an element of $C^1([0, \\pi], \\mathbb{R})$,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for all $x \\in [0, \\pi]$, $$|f(x)| \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\int_0^\\pi f'^2(t) dt}.$$\n\nThat seems to align with the example, where each assumption is a separate condition given in the problem statement. The user's example included two assumptions, even though one might have been part of the problem's original statement. So here, similarly, the two assumptions are given as separate lines.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is an element of $C^1([0, \\pi], \\mathbb{R})$,\n$\\int_0^\\pi f(t) dt = 0$.\nProblem:\nProve that for all $x \\in [0, \\pi]$, $$|f(x)| \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\int_0^\\pi f'^2(t) dt}.$$",
