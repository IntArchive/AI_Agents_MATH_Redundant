    "Content": "Fix arbitrary real numbers $x_1,\\ldots ,x_n$ which are pairwise distinct, i.e. so that $x_i \\neq x_j$ for any pair $i \\neq j$ . Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be the following $n \\times n$ matrix: Its diagonal entries are given by the equation, $$a_{ii}=\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\frac{x_i}{x_i-x_j},$$ while its off-diagonal entries given by the equation, $$a_{ij}=\\frac{x_i}{x_i-x_j}$$ , for $i\\neq j$ . For instance when n=2, the matrix looks like: $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{x_1}{x_1-x_2} & \\frac{x_1}{x_1-x_2}\\\\ \n\\frac{x_2}{x_2-x_1} & \\frac{x_2}{x_2-x_1}\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ Prove that the set of eigenvalues for the matrix A is of the form $\\left \\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\right \\}$ . I'm completely lost as to how to continue. I've tried to work on the determinant of $A-\\lambda I$ for $2 \\times 2$ and $3 \\times 3$ matrices $A$ but I haven't managed to find anything helpful towards the proof. Update 1 I'm not entirely sure how to write this formula nicely as a mathematical expression, but as code in python I have that the $k$ th element of $v_0$ is p = product([L[i-1] - L[j-1] for i in [1..n] for j in [i+1..n] if i != k and j != k])\n        v[k-1] = p if k % 2 == 1 else -p where L refers to the list [x_1,...,x_n] , and I want for $1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$ and for $i \\neq j \\neq k$ I also have that $v_i$ is equal to $diag(x_1,...,x_n)^{i}v_0$ Update 2 the eigenvectors for the case where $n=4$ are, $$ v_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2 - x_1x_3 - (x_1 - x_3)x_4}{x_2^2 - x_2x_3 - (x_2 - x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n\\frac{x_1^2 - x_1x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)x_4}{x_2x_3 - x_3^2 - (x_2 - x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2 - x_1x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)x_3}{x_2x_3 - (x_2 + x_3)x_4 + x_4^2}\n\\end{pmatrix},$$ $$v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2x_2 - x_1x_2x_3 - (x_1x_2 - x_2x_3)*x_4}{x_1x_2^2 - x_1x_2x_3 - (x_1x_2 - x_1x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{(x_1 - x_2)x_3x_4 - (x_1^2 - x_1x_2)x_3}{x_1x_2x_3 - x_1x_3^2 - (x_1x_2 - x_1x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)x_3)x_4}{x_1x_2x_3 + x_1x_4^2 - (x_1x_2 + x_1x_3)x_4}\n\\end{pmatrix},$$ $$v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2x_2^2 - x_1x_2^2x_3 - (x_1x_2^2 - x_2^2x_3)x_4}{x_1^2x_2^2 - x_1^2x_2x_3 - (x_1^2x_2 - x_1^2x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{(x_1 - x_2)x_3^2x_4 - (x_1^2 - x_1x_2)x_3^2}{x_1^2x_2x_3 - x_1^2x_3^2 - (x_1^2x_2 - x_1^2x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2 - x_1x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)x_3)x_4^2}{x_1^2x_2x_3 + x_1^2x_4^2 - (x_1^2x_2 + x_1^2x_3)x_4}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$ $$v_3 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2x_2^3 - x_1x_2^3x_3 - (x_1x_2^3 - x_2^3x_3)x_4}{x_1^3x_2^2 - x_1^3x_2x_3 - (x_1^3x_2 - x_1^3x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{(x_1 - x_2)x_3^3x_4 - (x_1^2 - x_1x_2)x_3^3}{x_1^3x_2x_3 - x_1^3x_3^2 - (x_1^3x_2 - x_1^3x_3)x_4}\\\\ \n-\\frac{x_1^2 - x_1x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)x_3)x_4^3}{x_1^3x_2x_3 + x_1^3x_4^2 - (x_1^3x_2 + x_1^3x_3)x_4}\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ Update 3 I managed to work out a formula for the $j$ th element of the eigenvector with $eigenvalue=\\lambda$ and $size=n$ , $$(-1)^{j+1}\\frac{x_j^\\lambda}{x_1^\\lambda} \\prod_{k\\neq 1,k\\neq j}^n \\frac{x_1-x_k}{x_j-x_k}\n$$ I'm just not sure now as to how to use the formula for one entry of an eigenvector to prove the set of eigenvalues",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For $ k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$ , consider the (horizontal) vector $v_k$ with $i$ th coordinate $$ \\sum \\prod_{j=1, a_j \\neq i}^{k} {x_{a_j}}.$$ For example, with $n = 3$ , we have $v_0 = (1, 1, 1)$ , $v_1 = (x_2 + x_3, x_3 + x_1, x_1 + x_2)$ , $v_2 = ( x_2x_3, x_3x_1, x_1x_2)$ .

For example, with $v_{k-1}$ , the numerators are all $\\prod x_i$ , and by looking at the denomninators, they cancel out to 0, so $v_{k-1} A = 0 $ . Do you see how we get $v_k A = (n-1-k)v_k$ ?

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that a certain matrix has eigenvalues 0, 1, ..., n−1. The matrix is defined with diagonal entries as the sum over j≠i of x_i/(x_i−x_j) and off-diagonal entries as x_i/(x_i−x_j) for i≠j. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The variables x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers.\n2. These x_i are pairwise distinct, meaning x_i ≠ x_j whenever i ≠ j.\n3. The matrix A is an n×n matrix with specific diagonal and off-diagonal entries as defined.\n\nWait, the problem statement mentions that x_i are pairwise distinct. That's definitely an assumption. Then, the structure of the matrix A is given with diagonal entries being the sum of x_i/(x_i - x_j) over j≠i, and off-diagonal entries are x_i/(x_i - x_j) for each i≠j. So those are the conditions on the matrix entries. The problem is to show the eigenvalues are 0 through n−1.\n\nIn the example provided earlier, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers.\n- For each pair i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j (pairwise distinct).\n- The matrix A is n×n.\n- For each diagonal entry a_ii, a_ii = sum_{j≠i} [x_i / (x_i - x_j)].\n- For each off-diagonal entry a_ij where i ≠ j, a_ij = x_i / (x_i - x_j).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the eigenvalues of A are {0, 1, ..., n−1}.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one condition. Let me check again:\n\nThe first assumption is that x_1,...,x_n are real numbers. The second is that they are pairwise distinct. Then the matrix is n×n. Wait, maybe the matrix being n×n is inherent in the problem, but maybe the user should list it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't need to state the matrix is n×n because it's given as a definition.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Fix arbitrary real numbers x_1,…,x_n which are pairwise distinct... Let A be the following n×n matrix\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers.\n2. For all i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j.\n3. A is an n×n matrix where each diagonal entry a_ii = sum_{j≠i} (x_i / (x_i - x_j)).\n4. Each off-diagonal entry a_ij (i ≠ j) is x_i / (x_i - x_j).\n\nThen the problem is to prove the eigenvalues are 0,1,...,n-1.\n\nI think that's accurate. Let me check the example given in the user's initial message. In the example, the assumption listed was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was then to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So each assumption is a separate line, each one addressing one condition. So applying that here, the assumptions should list the conditions on x_i, their distinctness, and the structure of the matrix. Each entry's definition is a separate assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\n- x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers.\n- For each pair of indices i and j with i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j.\n- The matrix A is an n×n matrix.\n- For each diagonal entry a_{ii}, a_{ii} = Σ_{j ≠ i} (x_i / (x_i - x_j)).\n- For each off-diagonal entry a_{ij} with i ≠ j, a_{ij} = x_i / (x_i - x_j).\n\nBut wait, the problem defines A as an n×n matrix with those entries, so maybe \"A is an n×n matrix\" is redundant as it's part of the problem statement. However, in the example given, they listed \"n is an integer\" even though in the original problem, n is an integer. So perhaps including \"A is an n×n matrix\" is necessary as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two points are sufficient. Wait, the problem statement says \"Fix arbitrary real numbers x_1,…,x_n which are pairwise distinct... Let A = (a_{ij}) be the following n×n matrix:...\" So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. x_1, ..., x_n are real and pairwise distinct.\n2. A is defined with diagonal entries as sum_{j≠i} x_i/(x_i - x_j).\n3. Off-diagonal entries are x_i/(x_i - x_j).\n\nThus, each of these is a separate assumption. However, the problem says \"Fix arbitrary real numbers... pairwise distinct\". So maybe the first assumption is \"x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers\", the second is \"for all i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j\", and the third and fourth are about the matrix entries.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each bullet point in the assumptions is a single condition. Let me verify with the example. In the example, the problem had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each distinct condition is a separate line.\n\nThus, the formatted assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers,\nFor all i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j,\nThe matrix A is n×n,\nEach diagonal entry a_{ii} is equal to the sum over j ≠ i of x_i/(x_i - x_j),\nEach off-diagonal entry a_{ij} (i ≠ j) is equal to x_i/(x_i - x_j).\n\nBut maybe the matrix being n×n is implicit when defining its entries. However, to be thorough, perhaps it's better to include it. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example didn't include the size of the matrix as a separate assumption. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem was about A(n) defined as 5^n(...) - 6^n(...), and the formatted assumptions were n is integer and n divisible by 7. So perhaps the matrix's size being n×n is part of the problem's setup but not an assumption. Hmm, but the problem does state \"Fix arbitrary real numbers x_1,…,x_n\" so n is part of the problem's setup. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumption was n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, maybe in that example, the user mistakenly added \"n divisible by 7\" when the original problem didn't state that? Wait no, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n. But the user's example shows that they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, perhaps mistakenly. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, we need to be careful to only list the assumptions given in the problem, not add extra ones.\n\nWait the original problem here says: Fix arbitrary real numbers x_1,…,x_n which are pairwise distinct. Then defines matrix A. So the assumptions are:\n\n- x_1,...,x_n are real numbers.\n\n- For all i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j.\n\n- The matrix A is constructed with diagonal entries as given and off-diagonal as given.\n\nSo in this case, the matrix being n×n is a consequence of the number of variables being n. So perhaps we don't need to list \"A is n×n\" as an assumption. The problem already defines A as an n×n matrix. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are real numbers.\n\n2. For each i ≠ j, x_i ≠ x_j.\n\n3. For each diagonal entry a_{ii}, a_{ii} = sum_{j ≠ i} (x_i / (x_i - x_j)).\n\n4. For each off-diagonal entry a_{ij} (i ≠ j), a_{ij} = x_i / (x_i - x_j).\n\nThus, each of these four points is an assumption.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the eigenvalues are 0,1,...,n-1.\n\nTherefore, putting this together.",
