    "AcceptedAnswer": "From comments: it would appear that part III is not relevant for the original question. Plus, if we drop part III, the remaining induction hypotheses take effect with smaller $n.$ On the other hand, finding III is what allowed me to solve the problem; together, parts III and IV give a quite precise rate of convergence. I put in some lines of symbols to divide the parts. Take $$ a_n = 1 + \\delta_n $$ I get\n$$ 1 + \\delta_{n+1} = \\frac{n+1+ n \\delta_n}{n+1+ \\delta_{n-1}}  $$ The induction hypotheses become extensive, and are true for $n \\geq 8:$ $$ \\mbox{I:} \\hspace{20mm}  \\delta_n > 0, $$\n$$ \\mbox{II:} \\hspace{20mm}  n \\delta_n < 1, $$\n$$ \\mbox{III:} \\hspace{20mm}  n \\delta_n > (n-3) \\delta_{n-1} > \\delta_{n-1}, $$\n$$ \\mbox{IV:} \\hspace{20mm}  n \\delta_n < (n-2) \\delta_{n-1}. $$ We begin with part III using only the $n \\delta_n > \\delta_{n-1}$,\n$$ 1 = \\frac{n+1}{n+1} < \\frac{n \\delta_n}{\\delta_{n-1}}, $$ by the ``mediant'' inequality $$ 1 = \\frac{n+1}{n+1} <  \\frac{n+1+ n \\delta_n}{n+1+ \\delta_{n-1}}   <\\frac{n \\delta_n}{\\delta_{n-1}}, $$\n$$ 1 = \\frac{n+1}{n+1} <  1 + \\delta_{n+1} < \\frac{n \\delta_n}{\\delta_{n-1}}, $$\nand $$  0 < \\delta_{n+1}.  $$ This was the  induction step part I. Context: in the setting of (simple) continued fractions, with two consecutive convergents (let's say it is for a positive irrational), when the \"partial quotient\" $a_n$ is equal to $1,$ the next convergent $\\frac{h_n}{k_n}$ is the mediant of the previous two.\n$$\\frac{h_n}{k_n} = \\frac{a_n h_{n-1}+ h_{n-2}}{a_n k_{n-1}+ k_{n-2}}  $$\nWhatever $a_n$ might be, the new convergent is between the  two given. $$  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   $$ From part II we get\n$$ 1 + \\delta_{n+1} = \\frac{n+1+ n \\delta_n}{n+1+ \\delta_{n-1}} < \\frac{n+2}{n+1+ \\delta_{n-1}} <  \\frac{n+2}{n+1} = 1 +   \\frac{1}{n+1}, $$\n$$ \\delta_{n+1} <   \\frac{1}{n+1}. $$\nThis was induction part II.\n$$  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  $$ Back to III, we have\n$$ \\delta_{n-1} < \\left( \\frac{n}{n-3} \\right) \\delta_n. $$ So\n$$  1 + \\delta_{n+1} > \\frac{n+1+ n \\delta_n}{n+1+  \\left( \\frac{n}{n-3} \\right) \\delta_n}. $$\n$$       n+1 + (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-3} \\right)  \\delta_n (1 + \\delta_{n+1}) > n+1 + n \\delta_n.               $$\n$$        (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-3} \\right)  \\delta_n (1 + \\delta_{n+1}) >  n \\delta_n.               $$\n$$ 1 + \\delta_{n+1} < \\frac{n+2}{n+1}  $$\n$$        (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-3} \\right)  \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+1} \\right)  \\delta_n  >  n \\delta_n.               $$\nFor $n \\geq 7,$\n$$ \\frac{n^2 + 2n}{n^2 -2n-3} < 2. $$\nFor $n \\geq 7,$\n$$    (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} > (n-2) \\delta_n  $$\nThis was induction part III.\n$$  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  $$ In the other direction, part IV gives\n$$ \\delta_{n-1} > \\left( \\frac{n}{n-2} \\right) \\delta_n. $$ \n$$  1 + \\delta_{n+1} < \\frac{n+1+ n \\delta_n}{n+1+  \\left( \\frac{n}{n-2} \\right) \\delta_n}. $$\n$$       n+1 + (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-2} \\right)  \\delta_n (1 + \\delta_{n+1}) < n+1 + n \\delta_n.               $$\n$$       (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-2} \\right)  \\delta_n (1 + \\delta_{n+1}) <   n \\delta_n.               $$\n$$       (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} +    \\left( \\frac{n}{n-2} \\right)  \\delta_n <   n \\delta_n.               $$\n$$  \\frac{n}{n-2} > 1  $$\n$$       (n+1) \\delta_{n+1} <   (n -1) \\delta_n.               $$\nThis was induction part IV.\n$$  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the specified format. The original question is about proving that a sequence is decreasing from n ≥ 3 onwards. The sequence is defined by a₁ = 1/2, a₂ = 1, and for n ≥ 2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n + 1)/(a_{n-1} + n). They also mentioned computing the first 200 terms and observing that it's decreasing from n ≥ 3, but can't prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem defines a sequence with specific initial terms and a recursive formula. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let me parse the given information:\n\n1. The first term is a₁ = 1/2. That's an assumption about a₁.\n2. The second term is a₂ = 1. That's an assumption about a₂.\n3. For all n ≥ 2, the next term a_{n+1} is defined as (n a_n + 1)/(a_{n-1} + n). This is the recursive formula, which applies to n ≥ 2 and involves a_n and a_{n-1}.\n4. The problem statement says to prove that the sequence {a_n} for n ≥ 3 is decreasing. So the conclusion to be shown is that a_{n+1} < a_n for all n ≥ 3 (or starting from n=3 onwards). However, the assumptions are the given conditions, not the conclusion. So the problem's goal is to prove the sequence is decreasing from n ≥ 3, given the initial terms and the recurrence.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"Prove that {a_n}_{n≥3} is decreasing.\" So, the problem is to show that starting from the third term onwards, each term is less than the previous. So the assumptions are the initial conditions and the recurrence relation. The problem is to prove the decreasing nature from n ≥3.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\n- a₁ = 1/2\n- a₂ = 1\n- For all n ≥ 2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n + 1)/(a_{n-1} + n)\n- The problem is to prove that the sequence {a_n} starting from n ≥3 is decreasing, i.e., a_{n+1} < a_n for all n ≥3.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the format, the assumptions included conditions on the variables. Here, the sequence is defined with specific initial terms and a recurrence. So each initial term is an assumption. The recurrence relation for n ≥2 is another assumption. So each of these is a separate line in the assumptions.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the sequence is decreasing for n ≥3. So the user might have some hidden assumption here, like the terms are positive or something. But according to the original problem statement, do they have any other conditions? Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Prove that {a_n}_{n≥3} is decreasing.\" The user computed the first 200 terms and saw that it's decreasing. The problem statement doesn't mention any other conditions, just the initial terms and the recurrence. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a₁ = 1/2\n2. a₂ = 1\n3. For all n ≥2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n +1)/(a_{n-1} +n)\n\nThen the problem is to prove that {a_n} from n≥3 is decreasing.\n\nWait, but maybe in the problem statement, there's a typo? Let me check the recurrence again: \"a_{n+1} = (n a_n +1)/(a_{n-1} +n)\" for all n ≥2. So for n=2, a_3 = (2 a_2 +1)/(a_1 +2). Plugging in a₁=1/2 and a₂=1, this gives (2*1 +1)/(1/2 +2) = 3/(5/2) = 6/5 = 1.2. Then a_3=1.2. Then a_4 would be (3 a_3 +1)/(a_2 +3) = (3*1.2 +1)/(1 +3) = (3.6 +1)/4 = 4.6/4 = 1.15. So a₄=1.15, which is less than a₃=1.2. Then a₅ would be (4 a₄ +1)/(a_3 +4) = (4*1.15 +1)/(1.2 +4) = (4.6 +1)/5.2 ≈5.6/5.2≈1.077, which is less than a₄=1.15. So the sequence is decreasing from a₃ onwards. But how do we prove this for all n≥3?\n\nBut in terms of assumptions, the problem doesn't state any other conditions. So the assumptions are just the initial terms and the recurrence. The problem is to prove that from n≥3, the sequence is decreasing.\n\nSo in the format:\n\nAssumption:\na₁ = 1/2,\na₂ = 1,\nFor all n ≥ 2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n +1)/(a_{n-1} +n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that {a_n}_{n ≥3} is decreasing.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in the user's instruction, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem here, the user might have filtered that. Wait, the original example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user provided a different example. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps that example is not correct. But maybe the user wanted to highlight that sometimes assumptions are not explicitly stated but are part of the problem's context. But perhaps in their example, the problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe a mistake in the example. But I should focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user wants the assumptions to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So the initial terms a₁ and a₂ are separate assumptions. The recurrence for n ≥2 is another assumption. The problem is to prove the sequence is decreasing from n≥3.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na₁ = 1/2,\na₂ = 1,\nFor all n ≥2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n +1)/(a_{n-1} +n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {a_n}_{n ≥3} is decreasing.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, the terms a_n must be defined. The recurrence involves division by (a_{n-1} +n), so we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero. The problem states that the user calculated the first 200 terms, implying that the denominator is always positive. So maybe an implicit assumption is that a_{n-1} +n ≠0 for all n ≥2. However, since the problem is to prove the sequence is decreasing, maybe this is part of the required proof, or it's an assumption. If the problem doesn't mention it, perhaps it's considered part of the problem's context, but since the user didn't state it, maybe we shouldn't include it unless it's given.\n\nWait, the original problem states the sequence is defined by those terms and the recurrence. So the fact that the denominator is non-zero is necessary for the sequence to be defined. If the problem didn't mention it, perhaps it's an implicit assumption, but since the user is able to compute 200 terms, we can assume that the denominator is positive for all n ≥2. However, in the problem formatting, the user's example included assumptions that were stated in the problem. The original example's problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was different. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. This might be a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that sometimes the problem statement might have hidden conditions. But in this case, the example seems incorrect. However, regardless of that, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user wants me to structure the problem as per the format. The assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. The problem statement says the sequence is defined with a₁=1/2, a₂=1, and the recurrence. So those are the assumptions. The problem is to prove it's decreasing from n≥3.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na₁ = 1/2,\na₂ = 1,\nFor all n ≥2, a_{n+1} = (n a_n +1)/(a_{n-1} +n).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {a_n}_{n ≥3} is decreasing.\n\nThat's it. There's no need to include other assumptions unless stated. The user didn't mention any other conditions, so the assumptions are just the initial terms and the recurrence.",
