    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given integral problem into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object per line. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem statement, it says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a correction. Wait, no, actually, maybe the example had a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they have an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is a modified version. Maybe the user made a typo. But regardless, the task here is to process the given integral problem.\n\nThe problem to format is the integral from 0 to pi/2 of ln(ln^2 sin theta / (pi^2 + ln^2 sin theta)) multiplied by (ln cos theta)/tan theta d theta equals pi^2/4. \n\nSo, the assumptions here. The problem is to prove that this integral equals pi²/4. Now, the integral involves several functions: ln(sin theta), ln(cos theta), and tan theta. The limits of integration are from 0 to pi/2. \n\nPotential assumptions: The variables and functions involved. Theta is a real variable in the interval [0, pi/2]. The functions ln(sin theta) and ln(cos theta) are defined in this interval. But at theta=0, sin theta=0, so ln(sin theta) would be ln(0), which is negative infinity. Similarly, at theta=pi/2, cos theta=0, so ln(cos theta) is ln(0). However, the integral might still converge despite these singularities. So perhaps the integral is an improper integral. Therefore, the assumptions might include that the integral is convergent. But maybe the problem assumes that the integral exists. Alternatively, maybe the problem is given as is, and the user doesn't need to list assumptions about convergence unless specified. The original example didn't include assumptions about convergence, only specific conditions on n.\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that case, there was an error in the example. But perhaps the example was to show how to structure, even if there was a mistake. So for the current problem, I need to list all assumptions. But the problem statement here is to prove the integral equals pi²/4. Are there any explicit assumptions given in the problem? The integral is from 0 to pi/2, and the integrand involves natural logarithms and trigonometric functions. The problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions; it's just to evaluate the integral. Therefore, perhaps the only assumptions are the domains of the variables and the functions involved. Let's think.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n1. theta is a real variable in the interval [0, pi/2].\n2. The integral is an improper integral evaluated as theta approaches 0 and pi/2.\n3. The functions ln(sin theta) and ln(cos theta) are integrable over the interval [0, pi/2].\n4. The integrand is defined using the principal branch of the logarithm.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify these, so maybe the user wants us to list the implicit assumptions. However, according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nWait, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that perhaps in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. \n\nSo for the integral problem, the problem is as stated. Are there any assumptions to list here? The problem is to prove that the integral equals pi²/4. The integral is definite, with limits 0 to pi/2. The integrand is a combination of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Perhaps the assumptions are that theta is in [0, pi/2], and that the integral is convergent. But maybe the problem assumes that the integral is well-defined. Alternatively, if the problem is presented as is, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions besides the integral setup. The example given by the user had two assumptions, but in the original problem, there was only \"for every integer n\". The formatted problem added an extra assumption. Maybe the user in the example intended to modify the problem. However, in the current case, the problem is to evaluate the integral, and there are no stated conditions. So maybe the assumptions are minimal. \n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Unless there was a miscommunication. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. Alternatively, perhaps the example is not well-structured, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless. \n\nBut in the current problem, the integral is presented as is. The only thing I can think of is the limits of integration and the variables involved. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\ntheta is a real number in the interval (0, pi/2),\nthe integral is interpreted as an improper integral at theta = 0 and theta = pi/2,\nln(sin theta) is real-valued for theta in (0, pi/2),\nln(cos theta) is real-valued for theta in [0, pi/2),\ntan theta is defined for theta in [0, pi/2).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking these down:\n\n1. theta is a real number in the interval [0, pi/2].\n2. The integral is evaluated as an improper integral at theta = 0 and theta = pi/2.\n3. ln(sin theta) is defined for theta in (0, pi/2].\n4. ln(cos theta) is defined for theta in [0, pi/2).\n5. tan theta is defined for theta in [0, pi/2).\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant. For example, the integral being from 0 to pi/2 already implies theta is in that interval. However, since the problem is presented as is, perhaps the only necessary assumption is that the integral is an improper integral, given the singularities at the endpoints. So, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is an improper Riemann integral.\n\nBut the user's example listed two assumptions. Maybe in this case, the key assumptions are about the convergence of the integral. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the integral equals pi²/4, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions needed here, and the problem stands as is. But according to the user's instruction, the task is to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. The original problem didn't have any extraneous information, just stating the integral to evaluate. So perhaps the only assumption is the integral is convergent. But how to phrase that in the required format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond what is given. However, the example included an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was wrong, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless. So perhaps in this integral problem, even if there are no explicit assumptions, I need to list the necessary ones for the problem to make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the variables' domains. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\ntheta is in the interval [0, pi/2],\nsin(theta) > 0 for theta in (0, pi/2],\ncos(theta) > 0 for theta in [0, pi/2),\ntan(theta) is defined for theta in [0, pi/2).\n\nBut each of these could be separate assumptions. But theta being in [0, pi/2] is one assumption. Then, sin(theta) > 0 in (0, pi/2] is another. Similarly for cos(theta) > 0 in [0, pi/2). But maybe these are too detailed. Alternatively, since the problem is to evaluate the integral, and it's given from 0 to pi/2, perhaps the main assumption is that the integral is over that interval. But in the example, they split the assumptions into separate lines. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nIntegration variable theta ranges from 0 to pi/2,\nln(sin theta) is defined for theta in (0, pi/2],\nln(cos theta) is defined for theta in [0, pi/2),\ntan theta is defined for theta in [0, pi/2).\n\nBut each of these is a separate assumption. However, the problem statement already includes the limits of integration, so maybe the first assumption is redundant. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" even though the problem statement said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user wants to list all the conditions, even if they are part of the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which translates to the assumption \"n is an integer\". Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, in the example, the formatted problem also added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but we need to follow the structure regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to pi/2, and the integrand involves ln(sin theta), ln(cos theta), and tan theta. The problem is to prove that this integral equals pi²/4. The assumptions needed here are the conditions under which the integral is defined and convergent. So, the integrand has potential singularities at theta=0 and theta=pi/2. At theta=0, sin theta approaches 0, so ln(sin theta) approaches -infty. Also, cos theta approaches 1, so ln(cos theta) approaches 0, and tan theta approaches 0. So near theta=0, the integrand behaves like ln( (ln^2 theta)/(pi² + ln² theta) ) * (ln 1)/theta. Wait, but ln(cos theta) near theta=0 is approx -theta²/2, so ln(cos theta) ~ -theta²/2. Then (ln cos theta)/tan theta ~ (-theta²/2)/theta = -theta/2. So the integrand near theta=0 is ln(...) multiplied by -theta/2. The ln(...) part: ln(ln² theta / (pi² + ln² theta)) = ln(1 / (pi²/ln² theta + 1)) = -ln(pi²/ln² theta + 1). As theta approaches 0, ln theta approaches -infty, so pi²/ln² theta approaches 0, so the argument inside the ln approaches 1, so ln(...) approaches 0. Therefore, near theta=0, the integrand behaves like 0 * (-theta/2), which is 0. So maybe the integrand is well-behaved at theta=0? Wait, but we need to check the limit more carefully. Let me think again.\n\nAs theta approaches 0, sin theta ~ theta, so ln sin theta ~ ln theta. Then ln^2 sin theta ~ (ln theta)^2. So the argument of the first ln is (ln^2 theta)/(pi² + ln^2 theta) = [ (ln theta)^2 ] / [ pi² + (ln theta)^2 ] = 1 / [ (pi²)/(ln theta)^2 + 1 ]. As theta approaches 0, ln theta approaches -infty, so (ln theta)^2 approaches +infty. Thus, pi²/(ln theta)^2 approaches 0, so the denominator approaches 1. Therefore, the argument of the first ln approaches 1, so ln(1) = 0. Therefore, the first ln term approaches 0. The second part is (ln cos theta)/tan theta. As theta approaches 0, cos theta ~ 1 - theta²/2, so ln cos theta ~ -theta²/2. tan theta ~ theta. So (ln cos theta)/tan theta ~ (-theta²/2)/theta = -theta/2. Therefore, near theta=0, the integrand behaves like 0 * (-theta/2) = 0. So the integrand approaches 0 at theta=0. Similarly, near theta=pi/2, let's check. Let phi = pi/2 - theta, so phi approaches 0 as theta approaches pi/2. Then sin theta = sin(pi/2 - phi) = cos phi ~ 1 - phi²/2. So ln sin theta ~ -phi²/2. Similarly, ln^2 sin theta ~ (phi²/2)^2 = phi^4/4. Then the argument of the first ln becomes (phi^4/4)/(pi² + phi^4/4) = phi^4/(4pi² + phi^4). As phi approaches 0, this approaches 0. So ln(...) approaches ln(0), which is -infty. But the other part: (ln cos theta)/tan theta. cos theta = cos(pi/2 - phi) = sin phi ~ phi. So ln cos theta ~ ln phi. tan theta = tan(pi/2 - phi) = cot phi ~ 1/phi. So (ln cos theta)/tan theta ~ (ln phi)/(1/phi) = phi ln phi. As phi approaches 0, phi ln phi approaches 0. Therefore, near theta=pi/2, the integrand is ln(small) * small ~ (-infty)*0, which is an indeterminate form. We need to check the limit more carefully. \n\nThe integrand near theta=pi/2:\n\nLet’s write theta = pi/2 - phi, phi approaching 0.\n\nThen:\n\nln(sin theta) = ln(cos phi) ≈ -phi²/2 (for small phi)\n\nSo ln^2(sin theta) ≈ (phi²/2)^2 = phi^4/4\n\nThe denominator in the first logarithm is pi² + ln^2(sin theta) ≈ pi² + phi^4/4 ≈ pi²\n\nThus, the argument inside the first ln is ≈ (phi^4/4) / pi² = phi^4/(4pi²)\n\nTherefore, ln(phi^4/(4pi²)) = ln(phi^4) - ln(4pi²) = 4 ln phi - ln(4pi²)\n\nNow, multiply this by (ln cos theta)/tan theta:\n\nln cos theta = ln(sin phi) ≈ ln phi (since sin phi ≈ phi for small phi)\n\ntan theta = cot phi ≈ 1/phi\n\nThus, (ln cos theta)/tan theta ≈ (ln phi)/ (1/phi) = phi ln phi\n\nTherefore, the integrand near theta=pi/2 is approximately [4 ln phi - ln(4pi²)] * phi ln phi\n\nAs phi approaches 0, phi ln phi approaches 0 (since ln phi approaches -infty but phi approaches 0 faster). Therefore, the entire expression approaches 0. Hence, the integrand approaches 0 at both limits. Therefore, the integral is proper at both endpoints, and converges. Therefore, the integral is convergent. \n\nTherefore, the assumption would be that the integral converges. But does the problem need to state that? Or is it part of the problem to recognize that it converges? Since the problem asks to prove the integral equals pi²/4, perhaps the convergence is implicit. Therefore, the only assumption needed is that the integral is convergent. However, according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut perhaps more specific. Alternatively, given that the problem is to prove the value, the main assumption is that the integral exists (converges). So, I think the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is convergent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}{\\pi^2+\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}\\right)\\,\\frac{\\ln\\cos\\theta}{\\tan\\theta}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}.$$\n\nBut the example had multiple assumptions. If the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\", then perhaps here, since the integral is from 0 to pi/2, the assumption is that theta is in [0, pi/2]. But that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Maybe the example's assumption was redundant. \n\nAlternatively, the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem. If the problem is to prove the integral equals pi²/4, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral setup. However, the example added an assumption not present in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but regardless, we need to follow the format.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed to list the necessary assumptions for the integral to make sense. Since the integral involves ln(sin theta), we need sin theta > 0, which is true for theta in (0, pi/2]. Similarly, cos theta > 0 for theta in [0, pi/2). Also, tan theta is defined except at pi/2. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\ntheta ∈ (0, π/2),\nsin(theta) > 0,\ncos(theta) > 0,\ntan(theta) is defined,\nthe integral converges.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\ntheta is in the interval (0, π/2),\nsin(theta) is positive,\ncos(theta) is positive,\ntan(theta) is defined for all theta in (0, π/2),\nthe integral converges.\n\nHowever, theta being in (0, π/2) is already implied by the limits of integration, but including it as an assumption might be redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes standard calculus conventions, so the integral is taken over the open interval (0, π/2) as an improper integral. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is an improper Riemann integral at theta = 0 and theta = π/2,\nsin(theta) > 0 for all theta in (0, π/2),\ncos(theta) > 0 for all theta in [0, π/2),\ntan(theta) is defined for all theta in (0, π/2).\n\nBut again, some of these might be redundant. Given the example's structure, which listed two assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them, perhaps we need to list all necessary conditions for the problem to hold. However, given the integral's complexity, maybe the only non-trivial assumption is the convergence of the integral. Therefore, I'll list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}{\\pi^2+\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}\\right)\\,\\frac{\\ln\\cos\\theta}{\\tan\\theta}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}.$$\n\nBut according to the example, they included assumptions that were part of the problem statement (n is an integer). Here, the integral limits are part of the problem statement, so maybe theta being in [0, pi/2] is an assumption. But I think the user wants to separate the problem's explicit statement from the underlying assumptions. Therefore, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \ntheta is in the interval [0, π/2],\nthe integral converges.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}{\\pi^2+\\ln^2\\sin\\theta}\\right)\\,\\frac{\\ln\\cos\\theta}{\\tan\\theta}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi^2}{4}.$$",
