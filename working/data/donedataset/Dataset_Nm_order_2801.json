    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral of sin(sin x) from -π to π is zero without relying on the fact that sin(x) is an odd function. Hmm, normally we might just say that since sin(x) is odd, then sin(sin(-x)) = sin(-sin x) = -sin(sin x), making the integrand odd, and the integral over a symmetric interval around zero would be zero. But here, they want an alternative approach.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's another symmetry or property we can use. Let me think about substitution methods. Maybe a substitution like u = x + π or something else that shifts the interval? Wait, the limits are from -π to π. If I consider substituting t = -x, but that would lead us back to the odd function argument, which they want to avoid. So that's not helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: Fourier series or expansions. Maybe expanding sin(sin x) into a series and integrating term by term. But integrating sin(sin x) directly might be complicated. Alternatively, using properties of even and odd functions without explicitly stating that sin(x) is odd. Wait, but the integrand's parity is directly tied to sin(x)'s parity, so avoiding that might be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps using the integral's properties over a period. The function sin(sin x) has a period of 2π, right? So integrating over an interval of length 2π, but here we're integrating from -π to π, which is also 2π. However, that alone doesn't directly help. But maybe considering the function's symmetry over this interval.\n\nLet me try substitution. Let’s set t = x - π. Then when x = -π, t = -2π, and when x = π, t = 0. But that shifts the interval, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, splitting the integral into two parts: from -π to 0 and 0 to π. Then in the first part, substitute x = -t. But that again leads to the odd function argument. The user wants to avoid that, so that substitution might not be allowed here.\n\nAlternatively, could we use integration by parts? Let’s see. Let u = sin(sin x), dv = dx. Then du = cos(sin x) cos x dx, and v = x. But integrating x cos(sin x) cos x dx from -π to π doesn't look promising. Maybe another choice? Not sure.\n\nWhat about using complex analysis or residues? The user mentioned residues as a possible method. Let me recall that integrating functions involving sin or cos over a period can sometimes be approached using contour integrals. For example, substituting z = e^{ix}, which converts the integral into a contour integral around the unit circle. Then, perhaps express sin(sin x) in terms of complex exponentials and see if the integral can be evaluated via residues.\n\nExpressing sin(sin x) as the imaginary part of e^{i sin x}, so the integral becomes the imaginary part of the integral of e^{i sin x} dx from -π to π. Then, the integral of e^{i sin x} over -π to π is related to the Bessel functions. Specifically, the integral of e^{i a sin x} over 0 to 2π is 2π J_0(a), where J_0 is the Bessel function of the first kind. But here, integrating from -π to π is the same as integrating over 0 to 2π because of periodicity. So the integral of e^{i sin x} dx from -π to π would be 2π J_0(1). But since we're taking the imaginary part of this integral, and J_0(1) is a real number, the imaginary part would be zero. Hence, the integral of sin(sin x) dx from -π to π is zero. But does this approach count as not using the oddness of sin(x)? It might, since it's using complex analysis and properties of Bessel functions. However, the user might not consider this elementary enough. Also, the original problem mentions that Wolfram said it's uncomputable, but perhaps that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe they can use a substitution that reveals the integral's antisymmetry without explicitly stating the function is odd.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider the substitution x = π - t. Then when x = -π, t = 2π, and when x = π, t = 0. So the integral becomes from t=2π to t=0 of sin(sin(π - t)) (-dt) = integral from 0 to 2π of sin(sin(π - t)) dt. But sin(π - t) = sin t, so this becomes integral from 0 to 2π of sin(sin t) dt. But the original integral from -π to π is the same as integrating from 0 to 2π, but shifted. Wait, but the integral from -π to π is over an interval of 2π, which is the same as integrating over any interval of length 2π. So perhaps the integral is the same as from 0 to 2π. But then, if we use the substitution t = x - π/2, shifting by π/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that sin(sin x) is an odd function around x=0, but again that's the same as saying sin(x) is odd. So maybe the residue approach is the way to go here. But I need to verify if that method actually works. Let me recall that the integral of e^{a sin x} over 0 to 2π is 2π I_0(a), where I_0 is the modified Bessel function. Wait, no, that's for hyperbolic functions. For e^{i a sin x}, it's 2π J_0(a). So integrating e^{i sin x} from -π to π gives the same as from 0 to 2π, which is 2π J_0(1). Then, taking the imaginary part, which is zero, because J_0(1) is real. Hence, the integral of sin(sin x) dx over -π to π is zero. This method uses complex analysis and doesn't directly reference the oddness of sin(x). Therefore, this could be a valid approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding sin(sin x) into a Fourier series. The Fourier series of sin(sin x) can be expressed in terms of Bessel functions as well. Specifically, sin(sin x) can be written as 2 Σ_{k=0}^∞ J_{2k+1}(1) sin((2k+1)x). Then integrating term by term from -π to π would result in all terms integrating to zero, since the integral of sin((2k+1)x) over -π to π is zero. Hence, the entire integral is zero. This approach also avoids mentioning the parity of sin(x), but instead uses the orthogonality of sine functions over the interval. However, this might be considered a more advanced method, involving Fourier series expansions.\n\nAnother approach: substitution u = x + π. Let's see. Let u = x + π, so when x = -π, u = 0, and when x = π, u = 2π. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} sin(sin(u - π)) du. But sin(u - π) = -sin u, so sin(sin(u - π)) = sin(-sin u) = -sin(sin u). Hence, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} -sin(sin u) du. But the original integral is also equal to ∫_{0}^{2π} sin(sin u) du (since the function is 2π-periodic). Therefore, we have that I = -I, implying I = 0. Wait, but this substitution seems to use the fact that sin(x) is odd, because sin(u - π) = -sin u. Wait, but is this substitution acceptable without referencing the oddness of sin(x)? Let me check.\n\nThe identity sin(u - π) = -sin u comes from the angle addition formula: sin(u - π) = sin u cos π - cos u sin π = -sin u. This uses the periodicity and the addition formula, not directly the oddness. However, one could argue that deriving sin(-x) = -sin x is using the oddness, but here we're using a shift by π. So maybe this approach is valid without explicitly stating that sin(x) is odd. However, the problem states not to use the fact that sin(x) is odd. If this substitution relies on that property indirectly, then it might not be acceptable. But perhaps since it's a shift by π, which is a different argument transformation, it's allowed. In that case, this substitution shows that the integral from 0 to 2π of sin(sin(u - π)) du equals the negative integral from 0 to 2π of sin(sin u) du, but since the integral over a full period is the same regardless of shifting, this leads to I = -I, hence I = 0. This might be a valid method that doesn't directly use the oddness of sin(x), but rather a shift substitution and periodicity.\n\nSo, the key steps here are: use substitution u = x + π, leading to an expression where the integral equals its own negative, hence zero. This doesn't explicitly use that sin(x) is odd, but uses a period shift and the addition formula. Therefore, this seems like a viable method. Let me verify this substitution again.\n\nOriginal integral: ∫_{-π}^{π} sin(sin x) dx.\n\nSubstitute x = u - π. Then when x = -π, u = 0; when x = π, u = 2π. So dx = du, and the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} sin(sin(u - π)) du.\n\nNow, sin(u - π) = sin u cos π - cos u sin π = -sin u.\n\nSo sin(sin(u - π)) = sin(-sin u) = -sin(sin u), since sin is odd. Wait, here we used the fact that sin is odd. So this step requires knowing that sin(-y) = -sin y. Therefore, even though we did a substitution shifting by π, the critical step still uses the oddness of the sine function. Therefore, this approach might still be considered as using the oddness property indirectly. Hence, this method might not be acceptable per the problem's constraints.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. The substitution leads us to use the oddness of sine. So perhaps that method is invalid. Therefore, we need another approach.\n\nAnother idea: Expand sin(sin x) into a Taylor series. The Taylor series for sin(z) is z - z^3/3! + z^5/5! - ... So substituting z = sin x, we have sin(sin x) = sin x - (sin x)^3/6 + (sin x)^5/120 - ... Then integrate term by term from -π to π. For each term, integrate (sin x)^{2k+1} over -π to π. Since (sin x)^{2k+1} is an odd function when raised to an odd power, their integrals over a symmetric interval would be zero. Hence, each term in the series would integrate to zero, making the entire integral zero. But wait, this again relies on the fact that sin x is odd, and hence its odd powers are odd functions. Therefore, integrating an odd function over symmetric limits gives zero. But the problem specifies not to use the fact that sin(x) is odd. So this approach is also invalid.\n\nTherefore, methods like substitution leading to odd function properties or series expansions that use the oddness are not allowed. So perhaps the residue method is the way to go. Let me elaborate on that.\n\nExpressing sin(sin x) as the imaginary part of e^{i sin x}. Then, the integral becomes the imaginary part of ∫_{-π}^{π} e^{i sin x} dx. This integral is known to be related to the Bessel function. Specifically, the integral over a full period (0 to 2π) of e^{i a sin x} dx = 2π J_0(a). Here, a = 1, so the integral from -π to π is the same as from 0 to 2π because of periodicity. Therefore, ∫_{-π}^{π} e^{i sin x} dx = 2π J_0(1). Since J_0(1) is a real number, the imaginary part is zero. Hence, the integral of sin(sin x) over -π to π is zero. This method doesn't explicitly use the oddness of sin(x), but instead uses complex analysis and properties of Bessel functions. Therefore, this should be acceptable. However, the problem mentions that Wolfram says it's uncomputable, but maybe that's under certain methods. However, using residues or complex integration here might be a valid approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the integral's property as a Fourier coefficient. The integral of e^{i sin x} e^{-inx} dx over a period gives something related to Bessel functions. But in this case, we're integrating e^{i sin x} without the exponential factor, which corresponds to the n=0 term. But regardless, the key point is that the imaginary part of this integral is zero, leading to the conclusion. This seems like a solid method, though it might be advanced.\n\nAlternatively, can we use differentiation under the integral sign (DUIS) as the user suggested? Let's consider a parameter a in the integral, like ∫_{-π}^{π} sin(a sin x) dx, and differentiate with respect to a. But I'm not sure how helpful that would be. Let's see:\n\nLet I(a) = ∫_{-π}^{π} sin(a sin x) dx.\n\nThen I’(a) = ∫_{-π}^{π} cos(a sin x) sin x dx.\n\nBut integrating this seems complicated. However, if we can show that I(a) satisfies a differential equation leading to I(a)=0, but for our case a=1. But I don't see an immediate way to do that. Alternatively, perhaps noting that I(-a) = -I(a), so it's an odd function in a, but again this uses the oddness property, which we need to avoid.\n\nWait, but if we use the series expansion approach without referencing the oddness, but that's not possible. Because the series expansion would inherently use the oddness of sine.\n\nAlternatively, consider the average value of sin(sin x) over a symmetric interval. But without using the odd function property, how can we argue that the average is zero?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe using the substitution x = y + π/2. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{-3π/2}^{π/2} sin(sin(y + π/2)) dy. But sin(y + π/2) = cos y. So the integral becomes ∫_{-3π/2}^{π/2} sin(cos y) dy. However, the interval here is shifted, and sin(cos y) is an even function since cos(-y) = cos y. Hence, sin(cos(-y)) = sin(cos y). Therefore, the integral from -3π/2 to π/2 can be split into symmetric parts. But this seems messy and might not help. Also, shifting the interval complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, split the integral into two parts: from -π to 0 and 0 to π. In each part, make substitutions that might reveal some symmetry. For example, in the first part, let t = -x, leading to ∫_{0}^{π} sin(sin(-t)) dt = ∫_{0}^{π} sin(-sin t) dt = -∫_{0}^{π} sin(sin t) dt. Adding the two parts gives (-∫_{0}^{π} sin(sin t) dt) + ∫_{0}^{π} sin(sin t) dt = 0. But this again explicitly uses that sin(-t) = -sin t, which is the oddness property. Hence, this method is invalid per the problem's constraints.\n\nSo, the only viable method that doesn't reference the oddness of sin(x) is the complex analysis approach using residues or Bessel functions. Therefore, the answer would involve expressing the integral as the imaginary part of a complex exponential integral, which evaluates to a real number, hence the imaginary part is zero. This way, we avoid directly referencing the parity of sin(x).\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Express sin(sin x) as the imaginary part of e^{i sin x}.\n2. Note that the integral of e^{i sin x} over [-π, π] is equal to the integral over [0, 2π] due to periodicity.\n3. Recognize that this integral equals 2π J_0(1), a real number.\n4. Conclude that the imaginary part (which is our original integral) is zero.\n\nThis approach uses properties of Bessel functions and complex integrals, thus circumventing the need to mention the oddness of sin(x).\n\nAnother possible method: Using the fact that the function sin(sin x) is a periodic function with period 2π and integrating over any interval of length 2π gives the same result. However, this alone doesn't explain why the integral is zero unless we use symmetry. But without symmetry arguments, this is insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, contour integration: Let’s consider the integral of e^{i sin x} around the unit circle. Let z = e^{ix}, so dz = i e^{ix} dx = iz dx, hence dx = dz/(iz). Then sin x = (z - 1/z)/(2i). Therefore, e^{i sin x} = e^{(z - 1/z)/2}. The integral becomes ∮_{|z|=1} e^{(z - 1/z)/2} * dz/(iz). This can be related to the Laurent series expansion of e^{(z - 1/z)/2}, and the residue at z=0 would be the coefficient of 1/z, which is J_0(1). Hence, the integral is 2πi * residue, which gives 2πi * (J_0(1)/i) = 2π J_0(1). Again, the imaginary part is zero, so the integral of sin(sin x) is zero. This method uses contour integration and residues, satisfying the problem's condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the integral can be evaluated to zero using complex analysis methods involving residues or Bessel functions without invoking the oddness of sin(x).",
