    "Content": "(I'm new here, so I hope this question hasn't come up before) A bit of motivation for the problem: It is well-known that the equations $\\cos(x) = \\sin(x)$, $\\cos(\\cos(x)) = \\sin(\\sin(x))$, and $\\cos(\\cos(\\cos(x))) = \\sin(\\sin(\\sin(x)))$ all have infinitely many solutions in $\\mathbb{C}$ (the first and third have infinitely many solutions in $\\mathbb{R}$ as well).  The proofs in these cases are elementary, but break down when applying it to further (lacking a better word) iterations.  Using the fourth to illustrate: Consider the two functions $\\cos(\\cos(\\cos(\\cos(z))))$ and $\\sin(\\sin(\\sin(\\sin(z))))$, and for convenience, let $H(z) = \\cos(\\cos(\\cos(\\cos(z)))) - \\sin(\\sin(\\sin(\\sin(z))))$. Also, let $V = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\, | \\, H(z) = 0\\}$. The original question (while not phrased in this manner) was: Find $V$. It is not difficult to verify that $\\not\\exists z\\in V$ such that $\\Im(z) = 0$.  To prove this, locate local extrema of the function $H(x)$ (where in an abuse of notation, I use $H(x)$ to denote the restriction of $H$ to the real numbers), and one will find that all (relative) maximum and minimum values of the function $H(x)$ are strictly positive.  In fact, one can prove that $H(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{10} > 0$, $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.  There is a sharper estimate, but this is sufficient for our purposes, and proves that there are no real solutions to the equation $H(x) = 0$. Having proved that there exist no real solutions, the question now becomes: Is it possible to analytically (i.e. without numerical methods) prove that $V$ is non-empty? My first instinct was to try to use the Argument Principle, as applied either to a ball of radius $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ centered at $0$, or a rectangle of side-length $n$ centered at $0$, but I'm not sure if those integrals can be computed explicitly (even as contour integrals). Note:  It would be elementary to write an algorithm based on Newton's Method or some improvement thereof and attempt to find roots.  But stability is an issue if you are far from a root.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There was a proof that $\\cos^{(3)}\\sinh x=\\sin^{(3)}\\cosh x$ has infinitely many solutions in a previous version of this answer, but it turns out this is irrelevant to the question. We will try to solve $\\cos^{(n)}z=\\sin^{(n)}z$ using Rouche's theorem. We begin by inverting the equation to (almost) solve for $z$ on the left. Let $\\arccos z$ be the standard inverse cosine function with branch cuts for $z\\ge 1$ and $z\\le -1$, and let $\\arccos_2 z=\\arccos z$ if $\\Im[z]\\le 0$ and $\\arccos_2 z=-\\arccos z$ otherwise, which has a branch cut for $z\\le 1$. Now $\\arccos z$, $-\\arccos z$, and $\\arccos_2 z$ are all inverse cosines of $z$, so if we let $w=f(z):=(-\\arccos)^{(n-2)}(\\arccos_2 z)$ then $\\cos^{(n-1)} w=z$, and we are left to solve $\\cos z=\\sin^{(n)}f(z)$. Observe that $f$ has no branch cuts on the half-plane $\\Re[z]>\\pi$. The branch cut of $\\arccos_2 z$ is $z\\le 1$, and other branch cuts arise if $(-\\arccos)^{(i)}(\\arccos_2 z)$ is a branch cut point of $\\arccos$, for some $i<n$. That is, $(-\\arccos)^{(i)}(\\arccos_2 z)$ is real of magnitude at least 1. But if $\\Re[z]>\\pi$ then $\\arccos_2 z$ lies in the rectangle $|\\Re[z]|<\\pi/2$, $\\Im[z]>0$, and $-\\arccos z$ maps the region $|\\Re[z]|<\\pi$, $\\Im[z]>0$ to a subset of itself, namely $-\\pi<\\Re[z]<0$, $\\Im[z]>0$, so it can never be a real number. As $\\Re[z]$ becomes large, $f(z)$ behaves roughly as $\\log^nz$. So it does not ever stabilize completely, but it does grow slowly enough that it is effectively constant across each period of $\\cos z$. Here is a plot of $\\cos z-\\sin^{(n)} f(z)$: Near $0$ we have the crazy behavior of $\\sin^{(n)}$ visible, and the branch cut at negative reals is also visible, but on the right, we have very regular behavior, essentially the same as $\\cos z$ plus a slowly varying part. We now show that for some sufficiently large (but not too large - see below) real $x$, there are at least $2$ solutions of $\\cos z=\\sin^{(n)} f(z)$ with $|\\Re[z]-x|\\le 2\\pi$. It follows that $\\cos^{(n)}z=\\sin^{(n)}z$ has infinitely many solutions. Let $g(z)=\\sin^{(n)} f(z)$, and suppose we have chosen $x$ sufficiently large. We will approximate $g(z)$ by $g(x)$ in a nearby region, and use Rouche's theorem on the function $\\cos z-g(x)$, with $g(x)-g(z)$ as the perturbation. The region of interest is a rectangle bounded by $|\\Im[z]|\\le R$ and either $2\\pi n\\le\\Re[z]\\le 2\\pi n+2\\pi$, or $2\\pi n-\\pi\\le\\Re[z]\\le 2\\pi n+\\pi$, where $n$ is chosen so that the rectangle includes $x$. If $\\Re[g(x)]$ is negative, then $\\cos z-g(x)$ takes a minimum value at least $1$ on the vertical lines $\\Re[z]=2\\pi n$, so we use the region $2\\pi n\\le\\Re[z]\\le 2\\pi n+2\\pi$, and if it is positive then $\\cos z-g(x)$ takes a minimum value at least $1$ on vertical lines $\\Re[z]=2\\pi n+\\pi$, so we use the other region. It suffices to show $|g'(z)|\\le\\frac1{2\\pi}$ for all $z$ in the rectangle, because then $$|g(x)-g(z)|\\le \\frac1{2\\pi}|z-x|\\le \\frac1{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\Im[z]^2+(2\\pi)^2}\\le \\cosh \\Im[z]\\le \\left|\\cos z\\right|$$\nso Rouche's theorem applies. It turns out that it is surprisingly hard to show that $g(z)$ is slowly varying. The problem is that $\\sin^{(n)} z$ has the potential to blow up the value, but it doesn't in this case, and the reason is more subtle than a crude estimation will give you. Below is a plot of $\\sin^{(100)}z$. We can see the fractal nature of $\\sin^{(n)}z$ here; the red and blue basins are the regions where the sequence $(\\sin^{(n)}z)_n$ converges (slowly) to zero more or less along the real line near $\\sin 1$ (red) or $-\\sin 1$ (blue). The white regions are where $\\sin^{(n)}$ blows up (this process is extremely nonuniform, since the points are sent all over the plane and may hit a convergent region again). The orange point marked in both graphs is one of the fixed points of $-\\arccos z$, approximately $z^*\\approx -2.487 + 1.809 i$. As you can see this is within a basin of attraction of $\\sin^{(n)} z$, so eventually it will converge to zero as $n$ grows. The derivatives $\\frac{d}{dz}\\sin^{(n)} z\\large|_{z=z^*}$ bounce around for small $n$ but eventually converge to zero; in particular one can verify that $|\\frac{d}{dz}\\sin^{(n)} z\\large|\\le 120$, and $|\\sin^{(n)} z\\large|\\le 6$, for all $n$ and all $z$ within $0.002$ of $z^*$. Every point in $\\Re[z]>\\pi$ converges to $z^*$ under the sequence $z_n=(-\\arccos)^{(n)}(\\arccos_2z)$, and $|\\frac{d}{dz}(-\\arccos z)\\large|_{z=z^*}|\\approx 0.32$ so convergence is quite rapid; we have $|z_{n+1}-z^*|\\le \\frac12|z_n-z^*|$ for every $n$ and initial point $z$ with $ \\Re[z]>\\pi$. Now, suppose $\\Re[z]>\\pi$; then $$z_0\\in S'=\\{z\\mid -\\pi<\\Re[z]<\\pi\\wedge \\Im[z]\\ge 3/2\\},$$ and if we define $$S=\\{z\\mid -\\pi<\\Re[z]<0\\wedge\\Im[z]>0\\wedge |z|>3/2\\},$$ then $z\\in S'\\cup S\\to-\\arccos z\\in S$, so $z_n\\in S$ for all $n>0$. On the region $S$, the derivative of $-\\arccos$ has magnitude at most $2/\\sqrt 5\\approx 0.89$. Thus $|\\frac{dz_n}{dz_0}|\\le (2/\\sqrt 5)^n$ for all $n$ and all initial points $z_0\\in S'$. Returning to our Rouche's theorem application, we need $R$ to be large enough to enclose a root of $\\cos z-g(x)$, meaning that $\\Im[\\arccos g(x)]<R$; since $g$ will be bounded by $6$ in the region of interest it suffices to take $R=3$. In this case the entire rectangle lies within $\\sqrt{(x+2\\pi)^2+3^2}\\le x+7$ of the origin. If we take the smallest $x$ that produces a box which does not touch the branch point, namely $x=2\\pi$, then we find that $z_7$ is the first iterate which is guaranteed to lie within $0.002$ of the fixed point. Additionally, using that the derivative of $\\arccos_2 z$ is bounded by $1/\\sqrt{35}$, we find that $|g'(z)|\\le 120\\cdot \\frac1{\\sqrt{35}}\\cdot (2/\\sqrt 5)^{n-2}\\le \\frac 1{2\\pi}$ for $n\\ge 46$ (or $n\\ge 20$, with the better estimate $|\\frac{d}{dz}\\sin^{(n)} z\\large|\\le 6$ for $n\\ge 20$). Thus we have solved the equation for all $n\\ge 20$. Unfortunately this leaves quite a few cases to check, including the case $n=4$ in this question! We can still use the Rouche method for smaller $n$, but we must be more careful about the derivation that $g'(z)$ is small. There is a much simpler method for $n=4$ specifically, along the lines of the elementary solutions for $n=1,2,3$. Let $z=\\pi/2+i\\operatorname{arcsinh} x$, so that we must solve $g(x)=\\cos^{(2)}\\cosh x-\\sin^{(3)}\\sqrt{x^2+1}=0$. Here's a plot: By some easy bounds we can show that $g(0)=\\cos^{(2)}1-\\sin^{(3)}1>0$ and $g(5/3)<0$, so there is a root by the IVT.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the problem carefully and identify the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original question is about finding the solution set V of the equation cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) = sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))) in the complex numbers. The user mentions that there are no real solutions because H(x) ≥ 1/10 > 0 for all real x. Then they ask if it's possible to prove analytically that V is non-empty, i.e., that there are complex solutions without using numerical methods.\n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. The problem states several things:\n\n1. The functions involved are H(z) = cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))).\n2. V is the set of z in C where H(z) = 0.\n3. It's proven that no z in V has Im(z) = 0 (no real solutions).\n4. H(x) on the real line is always ≥ 1/10, so no real solutions.\n5. The question is whether V is non-empty, i.e., if there are complex solutions, and can this be shown analytically.\n\nBut the assumptions part should list the given conditions or properties of the problem, not the conclusions or what needs to be proven. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- z is a complex number (since V is defined for z in C).\n- H(z) is defined as cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) minus sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))).\n- The problem is to determine if V is non-empty, specifically asking for an analytical proof.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Solution set of cos(cos(cos(cos(x)))) = sin(sin(sin(sin(x))))\". The user rephrases the problem as finding V, the set of complex z where H(z)=0, and wants to know if V is non-empty.\n\nBut in the formatted example, the assumption includes properties like n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the functions and the domain. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H(z) = cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))),\n- z is a complex number,\n- V is the set {z ∈ ℂ | H(z) = 0},\n- It is proven that no real numbers are in V (i.e., for z with Im(z) = 0, H(z) ≠ 0).\n\nBut the last point might be a conclusion rather than an assumption. Wait, the user mentions that they proved there are no real solutions, so maybe that's part of the problem's given information. However, in the example provided, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's condition. So here, the user is stating that it's already proven that there are no real solutions, and the question is about whether V is non-empty (i.e., complex solutions exist). So perhaps the fact that there are no real solutions is an established result (an assumption for the current problem). Therefore, the assumptions would include that H(x) ≥ 1/10 on the real line, hence V contains no real numbers. But I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"It is not difficult to verify that there does not exist z in V with Im(z) = 0. To prove this, they checked H(x) on real numbers and found it's always positive. So the user has already proven that part, and now the question is whether V is non-empty. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- H(z) = cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))),\n- V is the set {z ∈ ℂ | H(z) = 0},\n- It is proven that for all real x, H(x) ≥ 1/10 > 0 (hence no real solutions).\n\nBut the problem is to show that V is non-empty (i.e., there exists at least one complex solution). So the problem statement would be \"Prove that V is non-empty\" or \"Is V non-empty? If yes, prove it analytically.\"\n\nWait, the user's exact question is: \"Is it possible to analytically (i.e., without numerical methods) prove that V is non-empty?\"\n\nSo the problem is to determine if V is non-empty and to prove it analytically. So putting this together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H(z) is defined as cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))),\n- V is the set of complex numbers z where H(z) = 0,\n- For all real numbers x, H(x) ≥ 1/10.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether V is non-empty using analytical methods (without numerical methods).\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line should just state the problem. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem is to prove that V is non-empty (i.e., that there exists at least one complex solution to the equation H(z)=0), and the user wants an analytical proof.\n\nSo structuring the answer:\n\nAssumption: \nH(z) = cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))),\nV is the set { z ∈ ℂ | H(z) = 0 },\nFor all real x, H(x) ≥ 1/10.\n\nProblem: \nProve that V is non-empty using analytical methods.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is one line per object. So each line should address one property. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example's assumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nEach line is one condition on n.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAssumption:\nH(z) is defined as cos(cos(cos(cos(z)))) - sin(sin(sin(sin(z)))),\nV is the set of complex numbers z satisfying H(z) = 0,\nFor all real numbers x, H(x) is at least 1/10.\n\nBut perhaps breaking down each part. For example, the first line defines H(z), the second defines V, the third gives the property of H on real numbers.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So the user has defined H(z), defined V, and established that real solutions don't exist (H(x) ≥ 1/10). The problem is then to show V is non-empty analytically.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$H(z) = \\cos(\\cos(\\cos(\\cos(z)))) - \\sin(\\sin(\\sin(\\sin(z))))$,\n$V = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid H(z) = 0 \\}$,\nFor all real numbers $x$, $H(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{10}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $V$ is non-empty using analytical methods.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nI think this captures the essential assumptions and the problem as stated. The user already knows there are no real solutions and wants to know if there are complex ones, with an analytical proof.",
