    "Content": "I need to prove that: If a nonzero linear functional $f$ on a Banach Space $X$ is discontinuous then the nullspace $N_f$ is dense in $X$. To prove that $N_f$ is dense, it suffices to show that $\\overline N_f = X$ which is equivalent to $(X \\setminus N_f)^o=\\emptyset$. (the interior of complement of $N_f$ is null set.)\nSince $f$ is a linear functional and is discontinuous, it has to be unbounded. I don't know exactly how to utilize these observations. Also on a related topic, I'm a little confused about how to exploit the a Linear Functional $f:X \\to R$ or a Linear Operator $T:X \\to Y$ being unbounded. Can I say that if a linear operator is unbounded then exists a sequence $<x_n>$ in $X$ s.t. \n$||Tx_n|| > n^2||x_n||$ for each $n$ or $||Tx_n|| > n||x_n||$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: $\\overline{N_f}$ is a subspace of $X$ containing $N_f$. What can you say about $\\mathrm{codim}\\, N_f$? Ok. So I'll give the answer. As $N_f$ isn't closed (since $f$ is discontinuous [Do you know that?]), $\\overline{N_f} \\supsetneq N_f$. It follows that $\\text{codim}\\, \\overline{N_f} < \\text{codim}\\, N_f = 1$ (since $\\dim \\text{Im}\\, f = 1$). So $\\text{codim}\\,\\overline{N_f} = 0$, i. e. $\\overline{N_f} = X$. HTH, AB",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that if a nonzero linear functional on a Banach space is discontinuous, then its nullspace is dense. Let's break down the information provided.\n\nAssumptions mentioned in the problem:\n1. The functional f is nonzero.\n2. f is a linear functional on a Banach space X.\n3. f is discontinuous.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the nullspace N_f is dense in X.\n\nThe user also mentions some related thoughts, like the equivalence of proving the closure of N_f is X and the interior of the complement being empty. They also discuss f being unbounded due to discontinuity and questions about unbounded operators. However, these seem like the user's attempts to work through the problem rather than part of the problem's assumptions. The example given in the initial instruction shows that assumptions are the given conditions, not the user's subsequent reasoning.\n\nSo, filtering out the extra information, the key assumptions are the three listed above. The problem is to prove the density of N_f under those conditions.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is listed separately. The example structures assumptions as separate lines for each condition applied to one object. Here, the objects are f, X, and N_f. But the main conditions are on f: nonzero, linear, discontinuous, and X being a Banach space. The Banach space condition applies to X, so that's a separate assumption. Each condition should be one line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n- f is a nonzero linear functional on X,\n- X is a Banach space,\n- f is discontinuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that the nullspace N_f is dense in X.\n\nI should check if all necessary conditions are included. The user's problem states \"on a Banach Space X\", so X being Banach is part of the problem's setting. The functional is nonzero and discontinuous. The linearity is inherent in being a linear functional. So the assumptions cover all given conditions. The user's confusion about unbounded operators and sequences is part of their thought process, not the problem's assumptions, so those are excluded.\n\nHence, the final structured problem should look like the example provided, listing each assumption line by line and then the problem statement.",
