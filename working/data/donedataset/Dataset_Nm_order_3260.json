    "Content": "Every set mentioned is a subset of the real numbers. Let $m^*(C)$ denote the outer measure of a set $C$. Let $E$ be $any$ set and $A,B$ be measurable, disjoint sets. I'm trying to show that $$m^*(E\\cap (A\\cup B))=m^*(E\\cap A)+m^*(E\\cap B).$$ Proof: \n($\\le$) follows by the countable subadditivity of the outer measure since\n$$E\\cap (A\\cup B)= (E\\cap A)\\cup (E\\cap B).$$ Here's where I get stuck: ($\\ge$) My attempts have reduced to something of the form: There are bounded open sets $G_1, G_2$ containing $E\\cap A, E\\cap\n    B$, respectively, such that $$m(G_1)\\ge m^*(E\\cap A),\\quad m(G_2)\\ge\n    m^*(E\\cap B).$$ Hence $$m^*(E\\cap A)+m^*(E\\cap B)\\le m(G_1)+m(G_2).$$\nAnd I would like to extend this inequality to $m(G_1\\cup G_2)$ but I\nknow that's not even true, especially since the sets $G_1, G_2$ may\nnot even be disjoint. I also tried de la Vallée-Poussin Criterion: Let $\\epsilon>0$. Since\n$A, B$ are measurable, there are closed subsets $F_1, F_2$ of $A,B$\nrespectively, such that $m^*(A\\cap E - F_1)+ m^*(B\\cap\n    E-F_2)<\\epsilon$. Even if I could show, $$|m^*(E\\cap (A\\cup\n    B)-[(F_1\\cup F_2))+ m^*(A\\cap E - F_1)+ m^*(B\\cap\n    E-F_2)]|<\\epsilon.$$ I'm not sure what that would mean. What I know: Measure has only been defined for bounded sets. A bounded set $A$ is $measurable$ if its outer and inner measures\n    are equal; if so, the measure of $A$ is the common value of these\n    measures. Differences, countable unions, countable intersections of measurable\nsets are measurable. The union of a set of pairwise disjoint measurable sets is\nmeasurable, with the measure of the union equal to the sum of the\nmeasures of the sets in the union. Outer and inner measures are monotone increasing functions. Countable subadditivity for outer measure, which states that if $A$\nis a countable or finite union of sets $A_i$ then $m^*(A)\\le \\sum\n   m^*(A_i)$. De la Vallée-Poussin Criterion, which states that a bounded set $A$\nis measurable iff for every $\\epsilon >0$ there is a closed set\n$B\\subset A$ such that $m^*(A-B)< \\epsilon$. For any bounded set $B$, I can always find a set $C$ that is a\ncountable intersection of open sets for which $B \\subset C$ and\n$m^*(B)=m^*(C)$. If $A$ and $B$ are measurable sets, then $m(A\\cup B) + m(A\\cap B) =\n   m(A) + m(B)$. If $A$ is bounded and $I$ is an open interval containing $E$, then\n$m^*(E) + m_*(I-E) = m(I)$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We start with a little Lemma: Lemma. Let $E\\subseteq \\Bbb R$. If $H\\supseteq E$ is a $G_\\delta$ set (countable intersection of open sets) such that $$m(H)=m^\\ast(E),$$ then for every $C\\subseteq\\Bbb R$ $$m^\\ast(H\\cap C)=m^\\ast(E\\cap C).$$ Proof. Let $C\\subseteq\\Bbb R$. In the following the superscript $^c$ means complement.\n$$\\begin{align*}\nm^\\ast(H\\cap C) &\\leq m^\\ast(H\\cap C\\cap E\\cap C)+m^\\ast((H\\cap C)\\setminus (E\\cap C))\\\\\n                &= m^\\ast(E\\cap C) + m^\\ast((H\\cap C)\\cap (E\\cap C)^c)\\\\\n                &= m^\\ast(E\\cap C) + m^\\ast(C\\cap (H\\setminus E))\\\\\n                &\\leq m^\\ast(E\\cap C) + m^\\ast(H\\setminus E)\\\\\n                &= m^\\ast(E\\cap C)\n\\end{align*}$$\nThe inequality $m^\\ast(H\\cap C)\\geq m^\\ast(E\\cap C)$ comes free by the monotony of the outer measure since $H\\supseteq E$. Proof of $m^\\ast(E\\cap (A\\cup B))\\geq m^\\ast(E\\cap A)+m^\\ast(E\\cap B)$. Pick $H\\supseteq E$ a $G_\\delta$ set so that $m(H)=m^\\ast(E)$. Then\n$$\\begin{align*}\nm^\\ast(E\\cap (A\\cup B)) &= m^\\ast(H\\cap (A\\cup B)) &&\\text{by the Lemma}\\\\\n                        &= m(H\\cap A) + m(H\\cap B) &&\\text{($^\\ast$)}\\\\\n                        &\\geq m^\\ast(E\\cap A) + m^\\ast(E\\cap B) &&\\text{by the monotony of the outer measure.}\n\\end{align*}$$\n($^\\ast$) because here we are dealing with measurable sets (of finite measure). Observation. Notice that such a $G_\\delta$ set $H$ always exist even if $E$ is unbounded.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that the outer measure of E intersected with the union of two disjoint measurable sets A and B equals the sum of the outer measures of E intersected with A and E intersected with B. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentions that every set is a subset of the real numbers. So that's one assumption. Then, A and B are measurable and disjoint. That's two more assumptions: one for A being measurable, another for B being measurable, and that they are disjoint. Also, E is any set. So putting that together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Every set mentioned is a subset of the real numbers.\n- A is a measurable set.\n- B is a measurable set.\n- A and B are disjoint.\n- E is any set.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Let E be any set\" so that should be included. Also, the outer measure is defined for all sets, so m^*(C) is the outer measure of C. The problem is to show that m^*(E ∩ (A ∪ B)) = m^*(E ∩ A) + m^*(E ∩ B). \n\nLooking at the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So I need to break down each condition. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal problem: \"Every set mentioned is a subset of the real numbers. Let m^*(C) denote the outer measure of a set C. Let E be any set and A,B be measurable, disjoint sets.\" \n\nSo translating that into assumptions:\n\n- Every set mentioned is a subset of the real numbers. (This is a general condition)\n- A is a measurable set.\n- B is a measurable set.\n- A and B are disjoint.\n- E is any set. (E has no specific conditions except being a subset of real numbers, which is already covered by the first assumption)\n\nThe problem is to prove that m^*(E ∩ (A ∪ B)) = m^*(E ∩ A) + m^*(E ∩ B). \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a separate line, addressing only one property for one object. So the measurable sets A and B are separate assumptions. Their disjointness is another. E being any set is another. The general condition about all sets being subsets of real numbers is another. That should cover it.",
