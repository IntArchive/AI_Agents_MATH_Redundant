    "Content": "Note: This question has been posted on StackOverflow . I have moved it here because: I am curious about the answer The OP has not shown any interest in moving it himself In the Communications of the ACM, August 2008 \"Puzzled\" column , Peter Winkler asked the following question: On the table before us are 10 dots,\n  and in our pocket are 10 $1 coins.\n  Prove the coins can be placed on the\n  table (no two overlapping) in such a\n  way that all dots are covered. Figure\n  2 shows a valid placement of the coins\n  for this particular set of dots; they\n  are transparent so we can see them.\n  The three coins at the bottom are not\n  needed. In the following issue , he presented his proof: We had to show that any 10 dots on a\n  table can be covered by\n  non-overlapping $1 coins, in a problem\n  devised by Naoki Inaba and sent to me\n  by his friend, Hirokazu Iwasawa, both\n  puzzle mavens in Japan. The key is to note that packing disks\n  arranged in a honeycomb pattern cover\n  more than 90% of the plane. But how do\n  we know they do? A disk of radius one\n  fits inside a regular hexagon made up\n  of six equilateral triangles of\n  altitude one. Since each such triangle\n  has area $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, the hexagon\n  itself has area $2 \\sqrt{3}$; since the\n  hexagons tile the plane in a honeycomb\n  pattern, the disks, each with area $\\pi$,\n  cover $\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\approx .9069$ of the\n  plane's surface. It follows that if the disks are\n  placed randomly on the plane, the\n  probability that any particular point\n  is covered is .9069. Therefore, if we\n  randomly place lots of $1 coins\n  (borrowed) on the table in a hexagonal\n  pattern, on average, 9.069 of our 10\n  points will be covered, meaning at\n  least some of the time all 10 will be\n  covered. (We need at most only 10\n  coins so give back the rest.) What does it mean that the disks cover\n  90.69% of the infinite plane? The easiest way to answer is to say,\n  perhaps, that the percentage of any\n  large square covered by the disks\n  approaches this value as the square\n  expands. What is \"random\" about the\n  placement of the disks? One way to\n  think it through is to fix any packing\n  and any disk within it, then pick a\n  point uniformly at random from the\n  honeycomb hexagon containing the disk\n  and move the disk so its center is at\n  the chosen point. I don't understand. Doesn't the probabilistic nature of this proof simply mean that in the majority of configurations, all 10 dots can be covered. Can't we still come up with a configuration involving 10 (or less) dots where one of the dots can't be covered?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Nice! The above proof proves that any configuration of 10 dots can be covered. What you have here is an example of the probabilistic method , which uses probability but gives a certain (not a probabilistic) conclusion (an example of probabilistic proofs of non-probabilistic theorems ). This proof also implicitly uses the linearity of expectation, a fact that seem counter-intuitive in some cases until you get used to it. To clarify the proof: given any configuration of 10 dots, fix the configuration, and consider placing honeycomb-pattern disks randomly. Now, what is the expected number $X$ of dots covered? Let $X_i$ be 1 if dot $i$ is covered, and $0$ otherwise. We know that $E[X] = E[X_1] + \\dots + E[X_{10}]$, and also that $E[X_i] = \\Pr(X_i = 1) \\approx 0.9069$ as explained above, for all $i$. So $E[X] = 9.069$. (Note that we have obtained this result using linearity of expectation, even though it would be hard to argue about the events of covering the dots being independent.) Now, since the average over placements of the disks (for the fixed configuration of points!) is 9.069, not all placements can cover ≤9 dots — at least one placement must cover all 10 dots.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to understand this problem. The user is asking about a proof that any 10 dots on a table can be covered with 10 non-overlapping coins of equal size. The proof presented uses a probabilistic argument based on the honeycomb packing of disks covering over 90% of the plane. The user is confused because they think the probabilistic method shows that most configurations work, but there might still be some specific configurations where a dot isn't covered.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem and the explanation given. The key points from the problem are:\n\n- There are 10 dots on a table.\n- We have 10 coins, each of size $1 (radius 1?), and they can't overlap.\n- The proof uses the fact that a honeycomb pattern covers about 90.69% of the plane, so the probability that a random point is covered is approximately 0.9069.\n- Using probability, the expected number of covered points when placing the coins randomly is 9.069, implying that there exists at least one arrangement where all 10 are covered.\n\nBut the user is questioning this reasoning. They think that even if the average is over 9, there might still be cases where one dot is left uncovered. However, the probabilistic method in mathematics often works by showing that the expectation is high enough that there must exist at least one instance where all are covered. Specifically, if the expected number of uncovered points is less than 1, then there must be some arrangement where no points are uncovered.\n\nWait, let me recall: The probabilistic method typically uses the fact that if the expectation of some random variable (like the number of uncovered points) is E, then there exists an outcome where the variable is at least E and at most E. But here, the expectation of the number of covered points is 9.069. So, if we have 10 points, the expectation of the number of uncovered points would be 10 - 9.069 = 0.931. Since the expectation is less than 1, there must be at least one arrangement where all points are covered. Because if every arrangement left at least one point uncovered, the expectation would be at least 1. Therefore, the existence follows.\n\nBut the user is confused because they think that probability doesn't guarantee all cases. They might be thinking of an average case versus worst case. The answer here is that the probabilistic method does provide a guarantee that at least one such arrangement exists, even if it's hard to construct explicitly.\n\nNow, to structure the problem according to the given format:\n\nAssumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to prove that 10 coins can cover 10 dots without overlapping.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the key assumptions are:\n\n- There are 10 dots on a table.\n- We have 10 coins, each of size $1 (radius 1, presumably).\n- Coins must not overlap.\n- The proof involves a hexagonal packing covering ~90.69% of the plane.\n\nBut in the problem part, we need to present the actual statement to prove, which is that the coins can be placed to cover all dots without overlapping.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more general. The assumptions might be:\n\n- There are 10 distinct dots on a plane table.\n- Each coin has radius 1.\n- Coins must not overlap when placed.\n- The plane can be tiled in a honeycomb pattern with each hexagon of area 2√3, each disk of area π.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions from the problem are:\n\n- The coins are placed in a honeycomb pattern.\n- The probability that a random point is covered by a coin is ~0.9069.\n- The expectation calculation shows that on average 9.069 points are covered.\n\nBut the user's confusion is whether this probabilistic argument actually ensures existence. So the problem statement as given is: Prove that any 10 dots can be covered by 10 non-overlapping coins of radius 1.\n\nBut the original problem in the question is exactly that. So the assumptions would be the given conditions: 10 dots, 10 coins of equal size (radius 1), non-overlapping placement. The problem is to prove that such a placement exists.\n\nHowever, the user might be missing some key assumptions from the proof, like the honeycomb packing's coverage density. But the structured problem should focus on the original problem's assumptions, not the proof's details. Wait, the example given included assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\" which were part of the problem's conditions, but in this case, the original problem doesn't have such specific assumptions except the number of dots and coins.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"any 10 dots on a table can be covered by non-overlapping $1 coins\". So the assumptions are:\n\n- The table is a flat plane (infinite? Or large enough? Probably assumed infinite or the argument is about the plane).\n- The coins are unit disks (radius 1).\n- The coins must not overlap.\n- The 10 dots are placed anywhere on the table.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nThere are 10 distinct points (dots) on a plane,\nEach coin is a unit disk (radius 1),\nCoins must not overlap when placed on the plane.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the 10 coins can be placed on the plane such that all 10 dots are covered.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions included specific conditions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem's assumptions are more about the objects (dots, coins) and their properties (non-overlapping, coverage). So the assumptions should list each of these conditions.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nThere are 10 distinct dots on a plane,\nEach coin has a radius of 1,\nCoins must be placed without overlapping.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the 10 coins can be placed to cover all 10 dots.\n\nBut the original question's problem is exactly this. The user's confusion is about the probabilistic proof's validity. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which focuses on the problem's conditions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, following the example, the assumptions would be the given conditions (number of dots, coins, their sizes, non-overlapping), and the problem is to prove coverage.\n\nSo, final answer:",
