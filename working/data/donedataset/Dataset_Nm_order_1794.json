    "Content": "This seems to be a fairly easy question but I'm looking for new points of view on it and was wondering if anyone might be able to help. (By the way- this question does come from home-work, but I've already solved and handed it, and I'm posting this out of interest, so no HW tag.) Let $B_n=B(x_n,r_n)$ be a sequence of nested closed balls in a Banach space $X$. Prove that $\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B_n\\neq\\varnothing$. As I said before, it should be rather simple. When the radii decrease to 0, it's just a matter of selecting any sequence of points in $B_n$, and it must be Cauchy- and the limit is in the intersection. My question is what to do when the radii do not decrease to 0? I got some tips about multiplying the balls by a sequence of decreasing scalars, or reducing the radii so that they decrease to 0, but found too many pathological cases for both methods. Finally- I used a geometric arguemnt (which i've shown to work in any normed space) that if $B(x_1,r_1)\\subset B(x_2,r_2)$ then $\\| x_1-x_2\\|\\leq|r_1-r_2|$.\nThis turned out to be some kind of technical catastrophe, but it worked... Still, if anyone knows of a more elegant solution, I'd love to hear about it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't know if this is more elegant, but that's about the best I can come up with at the moment and probably essentially the same as your argument. Consider first the situation $B_{\\leq r}(x) \\subset B_{\\leq s}(y)$. It is easy to see that $r \\leq s$. Claim. $\\|y - x\\| \\leq s - r$. Proof. If $x = y$ there is nothing to prove, so let's assume $x \\neq y$. The point $z = x - r \\frac{y-x}{\\|y - x\\|}$ belongs to $B_{\\leq r}(x)$ and hence also to $B_{\\leq s}(y)$. Therefore $\\|y - z\\| \\leq s$. On the other hand,\n\\[\ny - z = y - x + \\frac{r}{\\|y - x\\|} (y - x) = \\underbrace{\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{\\|y - x\\|}\\right)}_{\\lambda} (y - x),\n\\]\nso $s \\geq \\lambda \\|y - x\\| = \\|y - x\\| + r$ and hence $\\|y - x\\| \\leq s - r$. This means that a nested sequence of closed balls $B_{\\leq r_{n}}(x_{n})$ has the following properties: The sequence $r_{n}$ is monotonically decreasing, hence converges to some $r$. If $N$ is such that $r_{N} \\leq r + \\varepsilon$ then the above claim implies that for all $n\\geq m \\geq N$ we have $r_m - r_n \\leq \\varepsilon$, so $\\|x_{m} - x_{n}\\| \\leq \\varepsilon$ because $B_{\\leq r_{n}}(x_{n}) \\subset B_{\\leq r_{m}}(x_{m})$. In other words, the centers $x_{n}$ form a Cauchy sequence and their limit point $x$ must belong to $\\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\\infty} B_{\\leq r_{n}}(x_{n})$. Added: As Jonas pointed out, the argument can be made even simpler and doesn't need completeness: Suppose $r_{n} \\to r \\gt 0$. Then there is $N$ such that $r_{N} \\leq 2r$. Then for all $n \\geq N$ we have $r \\leq r_{n} \\leq r_{N} \\leq 2r$, so $r_{N} - r_{n} \\leq r$ and the claim implies that $\\|x_{n} - x_{N}\\| \\leq r \\leq r_{n}$, so $x_{N} \\in \\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\\infty} B_{\\leq r_{n}} (x_{n})$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about nested sequences of closed balls in a Banach space. The goal is to prove that their intersection is non-empty. The user mentioned that when the radii decrease to zero, you can use a Cauchy sequence argument, but the challenge is when the radii don't decrease to zero. They also discussed some methods they tried, like scaling the balls or adjusting the radii, but faced issues. They ended up using a geometric argument involving the distance between centers and the difference in radii.\n\nNow, to structure this properly. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement should then be stated clearly.\n\nFirst, the problem is in a Banach space, so completeness is a given. The key assumption here is that the balls are nested closed balls. Each subsequent ball is contained within the previous one. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. B_n = B(x_n, r_n) is a sequence of closed balls in a Banach space X.\n2. The sequence of balls is nested, meaning each B_{n+1} is a subset of B_n.\n\nThe problem is to show that the intersection of all B_n is non-empty.\n\nWait, does the problem have any other conditions? The user mentioned the radii decreasing to zero is a case they handled, but the problem as stated includes when radii don't decrease to zero. However, in the original problem statement, is there any explicit condition on the radii? The user's question says \"when the radii decrease to 0\" but the problem itself doesn't specify that. The problem just states nested closed balls. So the problem as given is general: any nested sequence of closed balls in a Banach space. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote: \"Let B_n = B(x_n, r_n) be a sequence of nested closed balls in a Banach space X. Prove that the intersection is non-empty.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a Banach space (complete normed space).\n- Each B_n is a closed ball in X.\n- The sequence B_n is nested: B_{n+1} ⊆ B_n for all n.\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a Banach space,\nEach B_n is a closed ball in X,\nThe sequence B_n is nested (i.e., B_{n+1} is a subset of B_n for all n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersection of all B_n is non-empty.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included specific conditions on n, like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the problem is more general. The Banach space is part of the setting, the closed balls are part of the problem's objects, and the nestedness is a condition on the sequence.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumption line by line:\n\n1. X is a Banach space.\n2. Each B_n is a closed ball in X.\n3. The sequence {B_n} is nested: B_{n+1} ⊆ B_n for all n ∈ ℕ.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that ⋂_{n=1}^∞ B_n ≠ ∅.\n\nThat should be correct. The user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are the Banach space, closed balls, and nestedness. Each is a separate condition applied to different objects (X, each B_n, and the sequence {B_n}).\n\nThe original problem didn't mention anything about radii decreasing to zero as part of the problem statement; that was part of the user's solution approach. The problem as posed is general: any nested sequence of closed balls in a Banach space. So the formatted problem should reflect that.",
