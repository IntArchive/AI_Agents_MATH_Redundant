I know I could probably find a solution that would complete the proof, but I don't think that is what this question is asking. What proof-techniques should I use to prove this is true?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I presume your teacher wants you to use the Intermediate Value Theorem : Let $f(x)=x^{10000}+x^{100}-1$.  Then $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, $f(0)=-1 $ and $f(1)=1 $. Since $f(0)=-1<0<1=f(1)$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is a point  $c$ in the interval $[0,1]$ with $f(c)=0$.  Since that point can't be $0$ or $1$, it must be in $(0,1)$. Informally: Since $f$ is continuous over $[0,1]$, its graph is \"unbroken\" over $[0,1]$.  Since $f(0)=-1$ and $f(1)=1$, the graph of $f$ must cross the horizontal line $y=0$ somewhere over the interval $(0,1)$. This intersection point gives you a value $c$ in $(0,1)$ where $f(c)=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is to prove that the equation x^10000 + x^100 - 1 = 0 has a solution between 0 and 1. Hmm, so first, I need to recall some theorems or methods that can show the existence of a root in an interval.\n\nThe Intermediate Value Theorem comes to mind. That theorem states that if a function is continuous on [a, b], and if the function takes on values f(a) and f(b) at each end of the interval, and if there's a value L between f(a) and f(b), then there exists some c in (a, b) where f(c) = L. So, in this case, if I can define a function f(x) = x^10000 + x^100 - 1, and show that it's continuous on [0,1], then check the values at 0 and 1. If f(0) and f(1) have opposite signs, then by IVT, there must be a root between them.\n\nLet me check f(0). Plugging in 0, we get 0^10000 + 0^100 - 1 = 0 + 0 - 1 = -1. So f(0) = -1.\n\nNow f(1) is 1^10000 + 1^100 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1. So f(1) = 1.\n\nSince f is continuous (because all polynomials are continuous), and f(0) = -1 < 0 and f(1) = 1 > 0, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some x in (0,1) where f(x) = 0. That should be the solution they're asking for.\n\nWait, but the problem states 0 < x < 1, so open interval. But IVT usually gives a point in the closed interval [a, b]. However, since f(0) is -1 and f(1) is 1, which are not zero, the root must be strictly between 0 and 1. Therefore, the conclusion holds.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe check if the function is increasing or decreasing in the interval? But actually, the IVT doesn't require the function to be monotonic, just continuous. So even if the function oscillates, as long as it goes from negative to positive, there's at least one root. Although in this case, x^10000 and x^100 are both increasing functions for x in [0,1], so their sum minus 1 should also be increasing? Wait, let me verify that.\n\nTake the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 10000x^9999 + 100x^99. Since x is in (0,1), x^9999 and x^99 are positive, so f'(x) is positive. Therefore, f is strictly increasing on [0,1]. That means there's exactly one root in (0,1). So not only existence but uniqueness as well. But the problem only asks for existence, so IVT suffices.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Define f(x) = x^10000 + x^100 - 1.\n2. Note that f is continuous on [0,1].\n3. Compute f(0) = -1 and f(1) = 1.\n4. Since f(0) < 0 and f(1) > 0, by IVT, there exists c in (0,1) such that f(c) = 0.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention uniqueness, so maybe that's extra. The assumptions here would be that f is continuous, and the function changes sign over the interval. The problem doesn't state any restrictions other than x being between 0 and 1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function f(x) = x^10000 + x^100 - 1 is considered.\n- x is a real number.\n- The interval of interest is (0,1).\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. So here, the main assumptions are that x is a real number between 0 and 1, and the function is defined as given. Wait, but the problem is to prove that there exists a solution in that interval. So maybe the assumptions are implicit in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the user's example, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the problem is about x being a real number in (0,1). But the problem doesn't state any prior conditions on x except that we are looking for a solution in 0 < x < 1. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The function f(x) = x^10000 + x^100 - 1 is considered.\n\nBut maybe more precisely, the problem is to find a real solution in (0,1), so the assumption is that x is a real variable. Also, since the function is a polynomial, it's continuous everywhere, which is necessary for applying IVT.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem according to the user's format, the assumptions would list each condition. But in this problem, the key points are:\n\n- The equation is x^10000 + x^100 -1 =0.\n- We are to find a solution x in (0,1).\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as separate points. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe function f(x) = x^{10000} + x^{100} - 1 is considered,\nthe problem is concerned with the interval (0,1).\n\nBut the problem statement itself already states the equation and the interval. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The equation is defined as x^{10000} + x^{100} - 1 = 0.\n- The problem requires a solution in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties applied to the object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe function f(x) = x^{10000} + x^{100} - 1 is continuous on [0,1],\nf(0) = -1,\nf(1) = 1.\n\nWait, but those are not assumptions, those are facts. The problem is to prove that there's a solution in (0,1), so the user's example had assumptions that the problem states. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem then listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. Maybe the original problem had some conditions? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which contradicts. Hmm, maybe the example is not accurate. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the equation x^10000 +x^100 -1=0, the problem is to prove existence in (0,1). The key elements are:\n\n- The function is defined as f(x) = x^10000 + x^100 -1.\n- The domain considered is x in (0,1).\n- The function is continuous (as a polynomial), but that's a fact, not an assumption.\n- The problem requires a real solution.\n\nBut the assumptions would be what the problem is assuming. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user is being asked to prove that such a solution exists. So the assumptions are the given conditions. But in this case, the problem is just to show that the equation has a solution in (0,1). The only assumptions are the equation itself and the interval. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is x^{10000} + x^{100} -1 =0,\nx is a real number,\nthe interval of consideration is (0,1).\n\nBut the user's example had separate assumptions for each condition. Maybe for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe equation f(x) = x^{10000} + x^{100} -1 is considered,\nthe problem requires a solution in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line. So each line is one assumption applied to one object.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f(x) = x^{10000} + x^{100} -1 is continuous on [0,1],\nf(0) = -1,\nf(1) = 1,\nx is a real variable.\n\nBut these are more like properties or facts, not assumptions. However, according to the user's example, they listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though in the original problem it was \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in their formatting, assumptions are the conditions or properties given in the problem. So maybe in this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe equation is x^{10000} + x^{100} -1 =0,\nthe solution must satisfy 0 < x <1.\n\nBut the problem says \"Prove that the equation ... has a solution with 0 <x <1\". So the assumptions here are the equation and the interval. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe equation is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1=0,\nthe solution is sought in the interval (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a solution to the equation in the interval (0,1).\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line restates the problem concisely. The original problem in the example was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with the assumptions including n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nx is in the interval (0,1),\nthe equation is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1=0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation has a solution with 0 <x <1.\n\nBut the interval (0,1) is part of the problem's requirement, not an assumption. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. In the user's example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Perhaps the example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to structure the problem with necessary conditions. For example, if the problem requires proving divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13), maybe the assumption is that n is divisible by both 7 and 13. But the example given by the user lists only n divisible by 7. That might be an error.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should include:\n\n- The function f(x) = x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 is continuous on [0,1].\n- f(0) = -1.\n- f(1) = 1.\n\nBut these are not assumptions; they are conclusions from the definition of f. Since f is a polynomial, continuity is inherent. The values at 0 and 1 are calculated, not assumptions. So perhaps the only assumption is that x is a real number. But the problem is to prove existence within an interval. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The equation f(x) = x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 =0 is considered.\n- The interval of interest is (0,1).\n\nThus, following the user's example format, the assumptions would be listed as separate points, each addressing one property. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe equation is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 =0,\nthe solution is sought in the interval (0,1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation has a solution with 0 <x <1.\n\nBut actually, the interval is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The problem is asking to prove that there's a solution in that interval. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The equation x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 =0 is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the equation has a solution with 0 <x <1.\n\nThat seems more accurate. Because the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven. The interval is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption. The user's example had assumptions that included conditions not explicitly stated in the problem. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the user intended for the assumptions to include any necessary conditions for the problem to hold, even if they're part of the proof.\n\nBut in the current problem, the proof relies on the continuity of f on [0,1], and the values at the endpoints. However, continuity is a property of polynomials, so it's inherent. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function f(x) =x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 is continuous on [0,1].\n- f(0) = -1.\n- f(1) =1.\n\nBut again, these are not assumptions but derived facts. The real assumption is that we're working within real numbers and considering the given equation. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe function f(x) =x^{10000} +x^{100} -1 is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists x in (0,1) such that f(x)=0.\n\nGiven the user's example, where they took the original problem and reformatted it with assumptions, even if some of those assumptions were part of the proof's conditions, maybe in this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The equation in question is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1=0.\n- We are examining the interval (0,1).\n\nBut the interval is part of the problem's goal, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions should only list what's given, not what needs to be proven. Therefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number.\n- The equation is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1=0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a solution with 0 <x <1.\n\nThis seems appropriate. The user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might have been a necessary condition for the divisibility by 91, but in the original problem statement, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So there might be a mistake in the example. However, following the user's instruction to format the problem as in the example, even if the example might have issues, I should proceed.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number,\nthe equation is x^{10000} +x^{100} -1=0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a solution with 0 <x <1.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated concisely.
