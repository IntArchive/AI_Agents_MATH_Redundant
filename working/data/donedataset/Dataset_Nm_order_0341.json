    "Content": "How do I prove that the norm of a matrix equals the absolutely largest eigenvalue of the matrix? This is the precise question: Let $A$ be a symmetric $n \\times n$ matrix. Consider $A$ as an operator in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ given by $x \\mapsto Ax$ . Prove that $\\|A\\| = \\max\\limits_j |\\lambda_j|$ , where $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ . I've read the relevant sections in my literature over and over but can't find any clue on how to begin. A solution is suggested here but the notion of diagonal operator is not in my literature so it doesn't tell me very much. So, any other hints on how to solve the question? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The norm of a matrix is defined as \\begin{equation}\n\\|A\\| = \\sup_{\\|u\\| = 1} \\|Au\\|\n\\end{equation} Taking the singular value decomposition of the matrix $A$ , we have \\begin{equation}\nA = VD W^T\n\\end{equation} where $V$ and $W$ are orthonormal and $D$ is a diagonal matrix. Since $V$ and $W$ are orthonormal, we have $\\|V\\| = 1$ and $\\|W\\| = 1$ . Then $\\|Av\\| = \\|D v\\|$ for any vector $v$ . Then we can maximize the norm of $Av$ by maximizing the norm of $Dv$ . By the definition of singular value decomposition, $D$ will have the singular values of $A$ on its main diagonal and will have zeros everywhere else. Let $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ denote these diagonal entries so that \\begin{equation}\nD = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n              \\lambda_1 & 0 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n              0 & \\lambda_2 & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n              \\vdots &  & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n             0 & 0 & \\ldots & \\lambda_n\n          \\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{equation} Taking some $v = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^T$ , the product $Dv$ takes the form \\begin{equation}\nDv = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n                  \\lambda_1v_1 \\\\\n                    \\vdots \\\\\n                  \\lambda_nv_n \n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\end{equation} Maximizing the norm of this is the same as maximizing the norm squared. Then we are trying to maximize the sum \\begin{equation}\nS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i^2v_i^2\n\\end{equation} under the constraint that $v$ is a unit vector (i.e., $\\sum_i v_i^2 = 1$ ). The maximum is attained by finding the largest $\\lambda_i^2$ and setting its corresponding $v_i$ to $1$ and then setting each other $v_j$ to $0$ . Then the maximum of $S$ (which is the norm squared) is the square of the absolutely largest eigenvalue of $A$ . Taking the square root, we get the absolutely largest eigenvalue of $A$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Norm of a symmetric matrix equals spectral radius.\" The question asks to prove that the norm of a symmetric matrix A is equal to the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues. The user mentions that A is a symmetric n×n matrix, considered as an operator in ℝⁿ with the mapping x ↦ Ax. The problem is to show that ||A|| = max_j |λ_j| where λ_j are the eigenvalues of A.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that A is a symmetric matrix. That's one assumption. Then, it's an n×n matrix, which is another assumption. Also, A is operating on ℝⁿ, so the space is ℝⁿ. The norm in question is the operator norm induced by the standard Euclidean norm, I think. Wait, the problem just says \"the norm,\" but since A is an operator, the default would be the operator norm. However, the user didn't specify which norm, but in the context of symmetric matrices, the operator norm (spectral norm) is usually the one that equals the spectral radius. So maybe that's an implicit assumption here.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement as given, the user says \"Prove that ||A|| = max |λ_j|\". So the norm here is the operator norm. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- The operator norm is considered (since they're talking about the norm of A as an operator in ℝⁿ).\n\nBut the problem might have more implicit assumptions. Let me check again. The question says \"Let A be a symmetric n×n matrix. Consider A as an operator in ℝⁿ given by x ↦ Ax. Prove that ||A|| = max_j |λ_j|.\"\n\nSo, explicit assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a symmetric matrix.\n2. A is n×n.\n3. The norm is the operator norm (since it's the norm induced by the vector norm on ℝⁿ, which is usually the Euclidean norm unless specified otherwise).\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were listed as individual properties. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about a symmetric matrix A. So the first assumption is \"A is a symmetric matrix\". The second assumption could be \"A is an n×n matrix\". However, in the problem statement, it's already given that A is an n×n matrix. So those are two separate assumptions. Then, the third assumption might be that the norm considered is the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the norm, but since it's a standard operator norm for matrices, maybe that's implicit. However, perhaps the key assumptions here are just that A is symmetric and n×n, and the rest is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the norm equals the spectral radius. The spectral radius is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. For symmetric matrices, the operator norm (induced by the Euclidean norm) is indeed equal to the spectral radius. So maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- The norm considered is the operator norm (but maybe this is part of the problem's context rather than an assumption).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes the standard Euclidean space, so the norm is the one induced by the inner product. But perhaps the user didn't specify, so the assumptions are just the ones given in the problem: A is symmetric and n×n. The rest is part of the problem to prove.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem according to the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the norm of A equals the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues, i.e., ||A|| = max_j |λ_j|, where λ_j are the eigenvalues of A.\n\nWait, but in the example, they included even the divisibility by 7 as an assumption. So in the original problem, the user might have had more conditions, but in this case, the problem is stated as \"Let A be a symmetric n×n matrix...\" So the assumptions are A is symmetric, A is n×n. The problem is to prove the norm equals the spectral radius.\n\nBut the original user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example shows that the formatted problem might have filtered out some information. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Let me check.\n\nWait, the example given by the user is:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7; it was for any integer n. But perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe there was a misinterpretation. Wait, but 91 is 7*13. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, it's only divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps the example is not correctly formatted. But regardless, the user is providing that as an example of how they want the formatting done.\n\nIn any case, the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated. In the current problem, the user says \"Let A be a symmetric n×n matrix. Consider A as an operator in ℝⁿ given by x ↦ Ax. Prove that ||A|| = max_j |λ_j|\".\n\nSo the explicit assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a symmetric matrix.\n2. A is an n×n matrix.\n3. A is considered as an operator in ℝⁿ (which is standard, but perhaps part of the problem setup).\n\nBut the problem statement says \"Consider A as an operator in ℝⁿ\", which might be part of the problem's context rather than an assumption. However, in the example, assumptions included \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's universal quantifier. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- The norm considered is the operator norm on ℝⁿ.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the operator norm, but since it's referring to the norm of A as an operator, that's implied. So perhaps the third assumption is that the norm is the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm on ℝⁿ. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that as part of the problem's context.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are things that are given in the problem. The original problem here says \"Let A be a symmetric n×n matrix. Consider A as an operator in ℝⁿ...\". So the assumptions are A is symmetric, n×n, and operating on ℝⁿ. However, operating on ℝⁿ is part of the setup, but perhaps it's redundant since A is n×n. So maybe the key assumptions are just that A is symmetric and n×n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a symmetric matrix.\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the norm of A equals the maximum absolute value of its eigenvalues, i.e., ||A|| = max_j |λ_j|, where λ_j are the eigenvalues of A.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement might not need to repeat \"A is an n×n matrix\" if that's implied by being an operator on ℝⁿ, but in the example, they separated \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So to be safe, list both.\n\nI think that's the correct structure. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is an n×n matrix.\nProblem: \nProve that $\\|A\\| = \\max\\limits_j |\\lambda_j|$, where $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.\n###",
