    "AcceptedAnswer": "By replacing $U$ with $U \\cap U^{-1}$ if necessary, assume that $U = U^{-1}$. Consider the set generated by $U$:\n$$S = \\{g_1 \\cdots g_n : g_1,\\cdots, g_n \\in U \\text{ for some $n$} \\}$$\nWe want to show that $S = G$ by showing that $S$ is nonempty, open, and closed. Connectedness of $G$ would then imply $S = G$. Non-emptiness is evident. For openness, note that for any $g \\in S$, $gU \\subset S$. For closedness, note that if $g \\notin S$, then $gU$ is disjoint with $S$. Otherwise if $gu \\in S$, we have $g = guu^{-1} \\in S$ as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"a neighbourhood of identity U generates G where G is a connected lie group\"\n\nThe question body says: \"Let G be a connected Lie group and U any neighbourhood of the identity element. How to prove that U generates G.\"\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The user wants the problem formatted with each assumption listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a Lie group. (That's one property applied to G.)\n2. G is connected. (Another property of G.)\n3. U is a neighbourhood of the identity element in G. (This is a condition on U.)\n\nThe problem is to prove that U generates G. So, the problem statement is to show that the subgroup generated by U is the entire G.\n\nWait, the original question says \"U generates G\". In group theory terms, when we say a subset generates a group, it means that the subgroup generated by the subset is the whole group. So the problem is to prove that the subgroup ⟨U⟩ equals G.\n\nNow, the example given earlier had assumptions each on separate lines, each applying to one object. So here, the objects are G and U. Let's list the assumptions:\n\nAssumption 1: G is a Lie group. (Applies to G)\nAssumption 2: G is connected. (Applies to G)\nAssumption 3: U is a neighborhood of the identity element. (Applies to U)\n\nEach of these is a single condition on one object.\n\nThe problem is then to prove that U generates G, i.e., ⟨U⟩ = G.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The original problem says \"any neighbourhood\", so U can be any neighbourhood, not a specific one. But the user's example didn't include quantifiers in the assumptions. For instance, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but here, the problem states \"U any neighbourhood\", so maybe the assumption is that U is a neighborhood of the identity, without specifying further. So the three assumptions above should be sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a Lie group,\nG is connected,\nU is a neighborhood of the identity element of G.\nProblem:\nProve that U generates G.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumptions included conditions on the same object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Similarly here, G has two properties: being a Lie group and connected. U has the property of being a neighborhood of the identity. So that's correct.\n\nI think that's all. The problem is to show that under these conditions, the subgroup generated by U is G itself. The answer would involve using properties of connected Lie groups, perhaps using the fact that the generated subgroup is open and closed, hence the whole group since G is connected.",
