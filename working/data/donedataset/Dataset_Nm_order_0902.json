    "Content": "I'd like to see a proof why $\\varphi \\in \\operatorname{Hom}{(S^1, S^1)}$ looks like $z^n$ for an integer $n$. At first I thought I could argue that if I have a homomorphism that maps $e^{ix}$ to some $e^{iy}$ for $x,y \\in \\mathbb R$ then $z = rx$ for some real number $r$. But on second thought I'm not sure why I can't have $\\varphi (e^{ix} ) = e^{g(x)i}$ for a $g$ other than $g(x) = \\lambda x$. I'm also interested in seeing different proofs. I'm sure there are several ways to prove this. Thanks for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to post the proof given in the notes posted by Zhen rewritten in my own words: First note that the proof needs the homomorphisms $S^1 \\to S^1$ to be continuous . (i) If $\\alpha : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous homomorphism then $\\alpha$ is of the form $x \\mapsto \\lambda x$ for some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This follows directly from the fact that $\\alpha$ is a linear map and one dimensional matrices are multiplication by scalars. (ii) Continuous homomorphisms $\\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ are of the form $e^{i \\lambda x}$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To see this note that $(e^{ix}, \\mathbb{R})$ is a covering space of $S^1$. Then by the unique lifting property we get that for a continuous homomorphism $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ there is a unique continuous homomorphism $\\alpha : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f = g \\circ \\alpha$ where $g (x) = e^{ix}$ is the covering map. By (i) we get that $f$ has to be of the form $x \\mapsto e^{i\\lambda x}$. (iii) If $\\varphi : S^1 \\to S^1$ and $\\psi : \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$ are continuous homomorphisms then so is $\\varphi \\circ \\psi : \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1$. So we know that $1 = \\varphi (\\psi (0))$. We also know $\\psi$ has to map $0$ to $1$ hence $\\psi (0) = e^{i 2 \\pi k}$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. And we also know that $1 = e^{i 2 \\pi n}$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Hence $\\varphi (z) = z^m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that any continuous group homomorphism φ from S¹ to S¹ must be of the form zⁿ for some integer n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what S¹ is. It's the unit circle in the complex plane, so elements are complex numbers z with |z| = 1. The group operation is multiplication. A homomorphism here means a function φ: S¹ → S¹ such that φ(z₁z₂) = φ(z₁)φ(z₂) for all z₁, z₂ in S¹. But the problem also mentions φ being in Hom(S¹, S¹), so I need to check if Hom here refers to group homomorphisms, continuous homomorphisms, or something else. The original question mentions the user thought about mapping e^{ix} to e^{iy}, which suggests they're considering the exponential map, so maybe they're working with continuous homomorphisms. The title says φ in Hom(S¹, S¹) are of the form zⁿ, so maybe Hom here is the group of continuous homomorphisms.\n\nThe user's initial approach was to consider φ(e^{ix}) = e^{i g(x)}, where x is real, and they thought maybe g(x) has to be linear, like g(x) = λx. But they were unsure why other functions g(x) wouldn't work. So, the key here is that the homomorphism property imposes strong conditions on g(x). \n\nLet me think: if φ is a homomorphism, then φ(e^{ix} e^{iy}) = φ(e^{i(x+y)}) = e^{i g(x+y)}. On the other hand, φ(e^{ix})φ(e^{iy}) = e^{i g(x)} e^{i g(y)} = e^{i(g(x) + g(y))}. Therefore, for φ to be a homomorphism, we must have g(x + y) ≡ g(x) + g(y) mod 2π. But since we're dealing with exponents, maybe we can ignore the 2π periodicity for a moment. Wait, but x is real here, and e^{ix} is 2π-periodic, so when we lift the homomorphism to the real line via the exponential map, we have to consider that g(x) must satisfy certain periodicity conditions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding functions g: ℝ → ℝ such that g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y) for all x, y ∈ ℝ (i.e., additive functions), and also g(x + 2π) ≡ g(x) mod 2π, because φ(e^{i(x + 2π)}) = φ(e^{ix}), so e^{i g(x + 2π)} = e^{i g(x)}. This implies that g(x + 2π) - g(x) must be an integer multiple of 2π. So, g(x + 2π) = g(x) + 2πk for some integer k. But since g is additive, g(x + 2π) = g(x) + g(2π), so g(2π) = 2πk. Therefore, k must be an integer. \n\nNow, additive functions on ℝ are linear if we assume continuity. Without continuity, there are pathological solutions, but in the context of topological groups like S¹, we usually consider continuous homomorphisms. So, if we assume φ is continuous, then g must be a continuous additive function on ℝ, which forces g(x) = λx for some λ ∈ ℝ. Then, the condition g(x + 2π) = g(x) + 2πk implies that λ(x + 2π) = λx + 2πk ⇒ λ*2π = 2πk ⇒ λ = k. So, k must be an integer, hence g(x) = kx, and thus φ(e^{ix}) = e^{i k x} = (e^{ix})^k. Therefore, φ(z) = z^k. But wait, when z is in S¹, z = e^{iθ}, so φ(z) = e^{ikθ} = z^k. Therefore, φ is the map z ↦ z^k for some integer k. \n\nBut the problem states that φ should be of the form z^n. So, k here is the integer n. Therefore, all continuous homomorphisms from S¹ to S¹ are given by z^n for some integer n. The key assumptions here are the continuity of φ and that it's a group homomorphism. \n\nThe user's initial confusion was about why g(x) can't be something non-linear. The answer is that without continuity, you can have other additive functions, but when you require continuity (which is natural in the context of S¹ as a topological group), the only solutions are linear functions. \n\nAnother approach might be to use the structure of S¹ as a Lie group. The Lie algebra of S¹ is isomorphic to ℝ, and the exponential map is t ↦ e^{it}. Then, a Lie group homomorphism induces a Lie algebra homomorphism, which in this case would be multiplication by some scalar, leading again to the same result. \n\nAlternatively, using Pontryagin duality, since S¹ is the dual group of ℤ, the continuous homomorphisms from S¹ to S¹ correspond to elements of ℤ, hence the maps z ↦ z^n. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to note that any continuous homomorphism from S¹ to S¹ lifts to a continuous homomorphism from ℝ to ℝ via the covering map ℝ → S¹ given by t ↦ e^{it}. The lifting lemma in covering spaces says that since ℝ is simply connected, there exists a unique lift φ̃: ℝ → ℝ such that φ(e^{it}) = e^{iφ̃(t)}. Then, φ being a homomorphism implies φ̃ is a homomorphism, and continuity implies φ̃(t) = nt for some integer n (since the lift must satisfy φ̃(t + 2π) = φ̃(t) + 2πn to ensure that e^{iφ̃(t + 2π)} = e^{iφ̃(t)} e^{i2πn} = e^{iφ̃(t)}, so n must be integer). Thus, φ(z) = z^n.\n\nSo, the main assumptions are that φ is a continuous group homomorphism from S¹ to S¹. The problem is to show that all such φ are of the form z^n for some integer n.",
