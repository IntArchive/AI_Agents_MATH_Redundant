    "Content": "I just wonder if my following solution is true. Let $X,Y$ be sets, let $f:X\\to Y$ be a function, let $\\{Y_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ be a family of subsets of $Y$ . (Note: I use equalities instead of mutual containment) $$\\begin{align}f^{-1}\\left[\\bigcup_{i\\in I} Y_i\\right]\n &= \\{x \\in X: \\mbox{there exists an}\\quad i \\in I\\mbox{ such that } y \\in Y_i,f(x)=y\\}\n \\\\&=\\bigcup_{i \\in  I} f^{-1}\\left[Y_i\\right]\n\\end{align}$$ I initially do not know how to get from the left to right, but when I put both sets in set notation, they turn out to be the same, hence the one line proof. Something go ultimately wrong?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The statement is true, and your argument is essentially right, but I would say that you are skipping steps to achieve that identification.  (Also, you should not have those $\\infty$'s on top of the union symbol). I would instead add: $$\\begin{align*}\nf^{-1}\\left[\\bigcup_{i\\in I}Y_i\\right] &= \\left\\{ x\\in X\\;\\left|\\; f(x)\\in\\bigcup_{i\\in I}Y_i\\right\\}\\right.\\\\\n&=\\Biggl\\{x\\in X\\;\\Biggm|\\; \\exists i\\in I\\text{ such that }f(x)\\in Y_i\\Biggr\\}\\\\\n&= \\bigcup_{i\\in I}\\{x\\in X\\mid f(x)\\in Y_i\\}\\\\\n&= \\bigcup_{i\\in I}f^{-1}[Y_i].\n\\end{align*}$$\nThe first equality is by definition of inverse image; the second by definition of the union; the third is by definition of union; and the fourth by definition of inverse image.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to verify if their proof for showing that the inverse image of a union equals the union of the inverse images is correct. They provided a one-line proof where they translated both sides into set notation and concluded they're equal. Hmm, first I need to recall what the inverse image of a set under a function means. \n\nSo, the inverse image f^{-1}[Y_i] is the set of all x in X such that f(x) is in Y_i. The problem is about showing that taking the inverse image of a union over i of Y_i is the same as taking the union over i of the inverse images of each Y_i. \n\nThe user's approach was to write out the left-hand side, f^{-1}[⋃Y_i], as the set of x in X where there exists an i in I such that f(x) is in Y_i. Then they equate this to the union of f^{-1}[Y_i] over all i in I. That seems right because the union of the inverse images would be all x such that for some i, x is in f^{-1}[Y_i], which is exactly the same as the set defined on the left. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned they used equalities instead of mutual containment. Usually, proofs for set equalities show each side is a subset of the other. Here, the user did a direct equality by expanding definitions. Let me check if there's any step missing. \n\nThe first line after the equals sign: {x ∈ X | ∃i ∈ I, y ∈ Y_i, f(x) = y}. Wait, the original definition of inverse image is {x ∈ X | f(x) ∈ ⋃Y_i}, which is equivalent to {x ∈ X | ∃i ∈ I such that f(x) ∈ Y_i}. The user's notation has \"y ∈ Y_i, f(x) = y\", which is a bit confusing. Because f(x) is in Y_i, not that there's a y in Y_i such that f(x) = y. Since f(x) is an element of Y, and Y_i is a subset of Y, so f(x) ∈ Y_i is the correct condition. \n\nSo the user might have a typo or slight misstatement in their set notation. Instead of \"there exists an i ∈ I such that y ∈ Y_i, f(x) = y\", it should be \"there exists an i ∈ I such that f(x) ∈ Y_i\". Then the rest follows, because the union of the inverse images is exactly the set of x such that x is in some f^{-1}[Y_i], which is equivalent to x being in the inverse image of the union. \n\nSo the core idea is correct, but the user's notation in the set builder part has a redundant y. They might want to correct that. Otherwise, the proof is valid because expanding both sides into their definitions shows they are the same set. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that their solution is correct, except for a minor notational issue in the set definition. They don't need mutual containment here because the definitions directly match when written properly.",
