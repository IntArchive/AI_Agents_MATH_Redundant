    "AcceptedAnswer": "Well your notation is a little bit confusing. Since we are considering free abelian groups, we should avoid additive notations for the commutative semigroup S. Let's talk of $(S, \\ast )$. If $F(S)$ is the free abelian group with basis $S$, we can assume $S \\subseteq F(S)$. So the set of relations is $$R = \\{ (a \\ast b) -a - b : a,b \\in S \\}.$$ Then, the Grothendieck completion is the abelian group $$G(S) = F(S)/ \\langle R \\rangle.$$ If $a \\in S$, I'll denote the coset $a + \\langle R \\rangle$ by $[a]$. The proof isn't hard. You'll just need to remember that in free abelian groups the expression in terms of a basis is unique. You can find one proof, with an ugly notation, in Rotman's 'Advanced Modern Algebra'. I'll reproduce below the proof on Magum's book 'An Algebraic Introduction to K-theory'. Suppose that $[a]=[b]$. Then, $a-b \\in \\langle R \\rangle$. That is, $$a-b = \\sum_{i=1}^n n_i((a_i \\ast b_i) - a_i - b_i),$$ where $n_i = 1$ or $-1$ and $a_i, b_i \\in S$. Bringing terms with negative coefficients to the other side, $$ a + \\sum_{n_i = -1}(a_i \\ast b_i) + \\sum_{n_i = 1}(a_i + b_i) = b + \\sum_{n_i = 1}(a_i \\ast b_i) + \\sum_{n_i = -1}(a_i + b_i).$$ Since $S$ is a basis of $F(S)$, the terms on one side of the equation are a permutation of those on the other side. Since $(S, \\ast )$ is commutative, it follow that, in S, $$ a \\ast \\prod_{n_i = -1}(a_i \\ast b_i) \\ast \\prod_{n_i = 1}(a_i \\ast b_i) = b \\ast \\prod_{n_i = 1}(a_i \\ast b_i) \\ast \\prod_{n_i = -1}(a_i \\ast b_i). $$ So $a \\ast c = b \\ast c$, where $$ c = \\prod_{i = 1}^n (a_i \\ast b_i).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about showing that if two elements in a commutative semigroup S become equal in the Grothendieck group G(S), then there must exist some element c in S such that a + c = b + c. They mentioned that they know it's true via other constructions of the Grothendieck group but want a direct proof using the free abelian group definition with relations [a+b] - [a] - [b].\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The Grothendieck group here is defined as the free abelian group generated by the elements of S, modulo the relations [a + b] = [a] + [b] for all a, b in S. So, two elements in the free abelian group are equivalent in G(S) if their difference is a sum of these relations.\n\nThe problem is: if [a] = [b] in G(S), then there exists c in S such that a + c = b + c in S. This is essentially the statement that the natural map from S to G(S) is injective if and only if S is cancellative, but here the user is not assuming cancellativity. Instead, they want to show that even if S isn't cancellative, if the images of a and b become equal in G(S), then they must be stably equal in S, i.e., a + c = b + c for some c.\n\nSo the key is to show that the equivalence relation induced by the Grothendieck group construction implies stable equality. In other words, the relations in G(S) are generated by the relations [a + b] - [a] - [b], so if [a] - [b] is in the subgroup generated by these relations, then there must be a sequence of such relations that leads to a + c = b + c for some c.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's think in terms of the free abelian group. The elements of G(S) are equivalence classes of formal differences [x] - [y]. The relations are that [a + b] - [a] - [b] = 0. So if [a] = [b] in G(S), then [a] - [b] is equivalent to 0, which means it can be written as a combination of the relations. Each relation is of the form [a + b] - [a] - [b], possibly with coefficients, but since we are in an abelian group, coefficients can be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but the relations are in the subgroup, so [a] - [b] must be expressible as a sum (with integer coefficients) of the relations. However, relations are elements of the free abelian group, so when we quotient out by the subgroup generated by these relations, two elements are equal if their difference is in that subgroup.\n\nTherefore, [a] - [b] is in the subgroup generated by the relations [x + y] - [x] - [y] for all x, y in S. So [a] - [b] can be written as a finite sum of such relations multiplied by integers (possibly negative). But since the relations themselves are elements like [x + y] - [x] - [y], their negatives would be -[x + y] + [x] + [y], which correspond to the relation [x] + [y] - [x + y].\n\nTherefore, [a] - [b] is a combination of such terms. Let's denote the relations as R_{x,y} = [x + y] - [x] - [y]. Then, [a] - [b] = Σ (n_i R_{x_i,y_i} + m_j (-R_{u_j,v_j})) for some integers n_i, m_j and elements x_i, y_i, u_j, v_j in S.\n\nBut since we can combine terms, this is equivalent to a sum of R_{x,y} with integer coefficients. However, in the free abelian group, we can have positive and negative coefficients. But relations are added as elements, so we can have both R_{x,y} and -R_{x,y}.\n\nBut how does this translate back to the semigroup S? The key is that if [a] - [b] is a combination of these relations, then when we express this in terms of the free abelian group, we can rearrange the terms to get an equation in the free abelian group that equates [a] + some terms to [b] + some other terms, where the extra terms come from the relations.\n\nThis is similar to the process in the standard construction of the Grothendieck group where you show that two elements are equivalent if there's a common \"summand\" that makes them equal. But here, we need to do it more formally.\n\nPerhaps using the explicit form of the relations. Suppose [a] = [b] in G(S). Then, in the free abelian group, [a] - [b] is in the subgroup generated by the relations R_{x,y} = [x + y] - [x] - [y]. Therefore, we can write:\n\n[a] - [b] = Σ (k_i ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i]))\n\nwhere the sum is finite, k_i are integers (positive or negative), and x_i, y_i are elements of S.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n[a] + Σ (k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i]) = [b] + Σ (k_i [x_i + y_i])\n\nNow, in the free abelian group, this equality means that the coefficients of each basis element must be equal. However, since the left-hand side and the right-hand side are combinations of [s] for various s in S, the coefficients must match.\n\nBut here, the coefficients on the left-hand side for each [s] must equal those on the right-hand side. Let's denote all the terms. Let me think of moving everything to one side:\n\n[a] - [b] + Σ (k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] - k_i [x_i + y_i]) = 0\n\nBut this is equivalent to the previous equation. Now, since the free abelian group is free, the only way a combination of basis elements is zero is if all coefficients are zero. Therefore, each coefficient for [s] must cancel out.\n\nBut how does this happen? Let's consider the coefficients. The term [a] contributes +1 to [a], -[b] contributes -1 to [b], and each term k_i [x_i] contributes +k_i to [x_i], k_i [y_i] contributes +k_i to [y_i], and -k_i [x_i + y_i] contributes -k_i to [x_i + y_i].\n\nTherefore, for each s in S, the coefficient in the left-hand side is:\n\nFor s = a: 1\n\nFor s = b: -1\n\nFor each x_i: +k_i\n\nFor each y_i: +k_i\n\nFor each x_i + y_i: -k_i\n\nAnd all other s: 0.\n\nSince the total must be zero for all s, we have that:\n\n1. For s = a: 1 + sum_{x_i = a} k_i + sum_{y_i = a} k_i - sum_{x_i + y_i = a} k_i = 0\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about it. Alternatively, since the equation must hold in the free abelian group, all coefficients must cancel. Therefore, every term must be canceled out by another term. For example, the +1 at [a] must be canceled by some negative terms, and the -1 at [b] must be canceled by positive terms.\n\nBut this seems messy. Perhaps instead of working with the free abelian group, we can think in terms of the relations. The key idea is that if [a] = [b] in G(S), then there exists a sequence of elements where we can add some c such that a + c = b + c in S.\n\nAnother approach: In the Grothendieck group, two elements [a] and [b] are equal if and only if there exists some c such that a + c is equivalent to b + c under the relations generated by the semigroup operation. But how?\n\nWait, the standard construction of the Grothendieck group for a commutative semigroup is to take S × S / ~, where (a, b) ~ (c, d) iff there exists e such that a + d + e = b + c + e. So in this case, the Grothendieck group is the set of equivalence classes [a, b] with [a, b] = [c, d] iff a + d + e = b + c + e for some e.\n\nBut the user is using a different definition: the free abelian group on S modulo the relations [a + b] - [a] - [b]. So we need to reconcile these two definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two definitions are equivalent, and the problem is to show that in the free abelian group definition, the equality [a] = [b] implies that there exists c such that a + c = b + c.\n\nTo do this, suppose [a] = [b] in G(S). Then, [a] - [b] is in the subgroup generated by the relations [x + y] - [x] - [y]. So, as before, [a] - [b] = Σ k_i ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i]).\n\nBut in the free abelian group, we can rearrange this as:\n\n[a] + Σ ( -k_i [x_i + y_i] + k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] ) = [b]\n\nBut since coefficients can be positive or negative, but we're in the free abelian group, perhaps we can collect positive and negative coefficients separately.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation as:\n\n[a] + Σ (k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] - k_i [x_i + y_i]) = [b]\n\nNow, consider this equation in the free abelian group. The left-hand side must equal the right-hand side, which is [b].\n\nBut each term in the sum on the left is either adding or subtracting elements. For example, if k_i is positive, we have k_i copies of [x_i] and [y_i], and subtracting k_i copies of [x_i + y_i]. If k_i is negative, it's the reverse.\n\nThis seems similar to the relations in the Grothendieck group. To make progress, perhaps we can consider moving all terms to one side:\n\n[a] - [b] + Σ (k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] - k_i [x_i + y_i]) = 0\n\nIn the free abelian group, this implies that each coefficient for every [s] must cancel out. Let's analyze the coefficients:\n\n- For [a], we have +1.\n- For [b], we have -1.\n- For each x_i, we have +k_i.\n- For each y_i, we have +k_i.\n- For each x_i + y_i, we have -k_i.\n- All other elements have coefficient 0.\n\nThe sum of all these must be zero, so every element's coefficient must net to zero. Therefore, the +1 at [a] must be canceled by some negative terms involving [a], and similarly for [b].\n\nBut this is quite abstract. Let's try to consider an example. Suppose that [a] = [b] in G(S). Then, according to the equation, there must be a combination of relations that leads to this equality. For simplicity, suppose that there's only one relation involved. For example, suppose [a] - [b] = k([x + y] - [x] - [y]). Then, depending on the sign of k, we can get different scenarios.\n\nIf k=1, then [a] - [b] = [x + y] - [x] - [y]. Rearranged, this is [a] + [x] + [y] = [b] + [x + y]. In the free abelian group, this implies that the multisets of elements must be equal. But since it's a free abelian group, the coefficients must match. Therefore, on the left, we have 1 occurrence of a, 1 of x, 1 of y. On the right, 1 of b, 1 of x + y. For these to be equal as elements of the free abelian group, we must have a = x + y, and x + y = b, which would imply a = b, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, this suggests that our initial assumption that there's only one relation might not work. Alternatively, maybe multiple relations are needed. Let's try with two relations. Suppose [a] - [b] = R1 + R2, where R1 = [x1 + y1] - [x1] - [y1], R2 = [x2 + y2] - [x2] - [y2]. Then:\n\n[a] - [b] = [x1 + y1] - [x1] - [y1] + [x2 + y2] - [x2] - [y2]\n\nRearranged:\n\n[a] + [x1] + [y1] + [x2] + [y2] = [b] + [x1 + y1] + [x2 + y2]\n\nNow, in the free abelian group, this equality means that the multisets on both sides must be the same. So the left side has a, x1, y1, x2, y2. The right side has b, x1 + y1, x2 + y2. For these to be equal as elements, each element's count must match. But unless a is equal to one of the sums, this seems problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relations can be applied in both positive and negative directions. For example, if we have a relation [x + y] - [x] - [y] = 0, then we can also write [x] + [y] = [x + y]. So, in the equation [a] + ... = [b] + ..., we can think of moving terms from one side to the other by applying these relations.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: since the Grothendieck group is the universal abelian group such that any semigroup homomorphism from S to an abelian group factors through G(S), then if [a] = [b] in G(S), then for any abelian group homomorphism f: S → A, we have f(a) = f(b). But in particular, consider the homomorphism from S to itself (if S is cancellative) that maps a to a + c. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, consider the universal property. Since G(S) is the universal group, if [a] = [b], then in any abelian group where the images of a and b must be equal. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, think of the elements of G(S) as differences [a] - [b], and the relations impose that [a + b] = [a] + [b]. So, in this group, the operation is addition, and the map from S is a homomorphism.\n\nBut the problem is to show that if [a] = [b], then there exists c such that a + c = b + c in S. This is precisely the statement that the natural map from S to G(S) is injective if and only if S is cancellative. But since S might not be cancellative, the map might not be injective, but when their images are equal, they must be stably equal.\n\nTo prove this, suppose [a] = [b] in G(S). Then, by definition of the Grothendieck group, there exists a sequence of elements and relations that connect [a] and [b]. Each relation is of the form [x + y] = [x] + [y]. So, perhaps through a series of such relations, we can show that a and b must have a common summand.\n\nWait, but how? Let's consider that in the free abelian group, [a] = [b] implies that [a] - [b] is a sum of relations. Each relation is [x + y] - [x] - [y]. So [a] - [b] = Σ ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i]). Let's rearrange this:\n\n[a] + Σ ([x_i] + [y_i]) = [b] + Σ ([x_i + y_i])\n\nIn the free abelian group, this equality holds. Now, in the free abelian group, equality means that the coefficients of each generator (elements of S) are equal on both sides.\n\nOn the left-hand side, we have [a] once, and each [x_i] and [y_i] once for each term in the sum. On the right-hand side, we have [b] once, and each [x_i + y_i] once for each term in the sum.\n\nFor these to be equal as elements of the free abelian group, the multiset of elements must be the same on both sides. That is, every element's count on the left must equal its count on the right.\n\nConsider the element a: it appears once on the left and zero on the right (unless a = b or a = some x_i + y_i). Similarly for b: once on the right, zero on the left unless b is some x_i + y_i.\n\nThis suggests that the only way this equality holds is if there is some cancellation through the relations. For example, the [a] on the left must be canceled by some [x_i + y_i] on the right that equals a, and similarly [b] on the right must be canceled by some [x_j + y_j] on the left.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's consider a concrete example. Suppose S is the semigroup {a, b, c, a + c = b + c}. Then in G(S), [a] = [b] because [a] + [c] = [b] + [c], so [a] = [b]. But according to the problem, this should imply that there exists c such that a + c = b + c, which is exactly what we have here.\n\nBut how does this emerge from the free abelian group construction? If [a] = [b] in G(S), then [a] - [b] is in the subgroup generated by the relations. So, [a] - [b] = [a + c] - [a] - [c] - ([b + c] - [b] - [c]) = [a + c] - [a] - [c] - [b + c] + [b] + [c] = [a + c] - [a] - [b + c] + [b]. But if a + c = b + c, then [a + c] = [b + c], so this becomes [b + c] - [a] - [b + c] + [b] = -[a] + [b], which is [b] - [a]. Therefore, [a] - [b] = -([b] - [a]) = [a] - [b], which is trivial.\n\nThis seems circular. Perhaps another approach: in the free abelian group, [a] = [b] implies that there exists a relation chain connecting them. Each relation allows us to replace [x + y] with [x] + [y] or vice versa. So, starting from [a], we can apply relations to transform it into [b]. Each application of a relation either breaks down a sum into its parts or combines parts into a sum. \n\nBut to go from [a] to [b], we need to have a sequence of such expansions or contractions. For example, if there exists c such that a + c can be expressed as some combination that also equals b + c after applying relations. But this is still vague.\n\nPerhaps induction on the number of relations used. Suppose [a] - [b] is a single relation. Then [a] - [b] = [x + y] - [x] - [y]. So [a] + [x] + [y] = [b] + [x + y]. In the free abelian group, this equality holds only if the multisets are equal. Therefore, either a = x + y and b = x + y (which would imply a = b), or other elements must cancel out. This doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have multiple relations. Let's take two relations:\n\n[a] + [c] = [a + c]\n\n[b] + [c] = [b + c]\n\nIf a + c = b + c, then [a + c] = [b + c], so [a] + [c] = [b] + [c], hence [a] = [b]. Conversely, if [a] = [b], then adding [c] to both sides gives [a + c] = [b + c], which by the freeness implies a + c = b + c. But this assumes that adding [c] is injective, which it isn't necessarily unless we have cancellation.\n\nWait, but in the free abelian group, [a + c] = [b + c] implies that a + c and b + c are related by the same relations. But how?\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe the key is to use the fact that in the free abelian group modulo the relations, if [a] = [b], then there must be some element c such that in the semigroup, a + c is equivalent to b + c under the relations. But the relations are generated by [x + y] = [x] + [y], so the equivalence is generated by splitting or combining elements. Therefore, if [a] = [b], there must be a way to add some elements to both a and b (i.e., some c) such that a + c can be transformed into b + c using the relations. Since the relations allow splitting and combining, adding c allows us to create a common term that can be canceled or transformed.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Maybe using induction on the number of relations. Suppose we have a proof of [a] = [b] using a certain number of relations. Then, if we can show that each relation application can be translated into adding an element c to both sides, we can combine these c's to get a common element.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the equation [a] = [b], we can write this as [a] - [b] = 0 in G(S). As before, this means that [a] - [b] is a combination of relations. Each relation is of the form [x + y] - [x] - [y]. So, [a] - [b] = Σ (±([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i])).\n\nNow, moving all terms to one side, we get an equation in the free abelian group where the sum of certain elements equals zero. The key is that in such an equation, the elements must cancel out in pairs. But since we're dealing with a free abelian group, the only way this happens is if every element's coefficient is zero.\n\nTo achieve this cancellation, the elements introduced by the relations must exactly cancel out the [a] and [b]. For example, the +1 coefficient at [a] must be canceled by a -1 coefficient somewhere, which can only come from a relation's right-hand side. Similarly for [b].\n\nThis suggests that there must be some relation where a is expressed as a sum of two elements, or conversely, some sum of elements equals a. But since S is a semigroup, we can keep adding elements to both sides until we can cancel out the differences.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation in the free abelian group as a way to balance the elements. For every [s] in the equation, the total coefficient must be zero. This means that the number of times [s] appears positively must equal the number of times it appears negatively.\n\nFor [a], we have +1, so there must be some term(s) in the relations that contribute -1 to [a]. Similarly, for [b], we have -1, so there must be terms contributing +1 to [b].\n\nThe relations that contribute to [a] would be those where a is expressed as a sum, i.e., relations of the form [a] = [x] + [y] - [x + y]. But wait, each relation is [x + y] - [x] - [y] = 0, so [x + y] = [x] + [y]. Therefore, to get a negative [a], we need a relation where [a] is subtracted, which would come from a relation where [x + y] = [x] + [y] with x + y = a. Then, rearranged, this gives [a] - [x] - [y] = 0, so [a] = [x] + [y].\n\nSimilarly, to get a positive [b], we need a relation where [b] is part of a sum that equals [x + y]. For example, if b is one of the summands in a relation.\n\nBut this is still not directly leading to the conclusion. Perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that in the free abelian group, the equality [a] = [b] implies that there exists a finite set of elements c1, c2, ..., cn in S such that a + c1 + c2 + ... + cn = b + c1 + c2 + ... + cn in the semigroup. This is similar to the usual definition of stable equality.\n\nBut how to show this? If we can show that the relations allow us to add elements to both a and b until they become equal, then we're done. Each relation [x + y] = [x] + [y] allows us to split or combine elements. By adding a common element c to both a and b, we can use these splits and combinations to make them equal.\n\nFor example, suppose we add c to both a and b, getting a + c and b + c. If we can split a + c into a sum of elements that also equals the split of b + c, then we can find a common element. But this requires the semigroup to have enough elements to allow such splits.\n\nHowever, in general semigroups, we might not have cancellation or the ability to split elements. But the problem states that if [a] = [b] in G(S), then there exists c such that a + c = b + c. This c serves as the \"witness\" that a and b are stably equal.\n\nTo formalize this, we can use the explicit expression of [a] - [b] as a sum of relations. Each relation is of the form [x + y] - [x] - [y]. Let's consider all these relations and collect the coefficients.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n[a] - [b] = Σ_{i=1}^n k_i ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i])\n\nwhere k_i are integers (positive or negative).\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to:\n\n[a] + Σ_{i=1}^n ( -k_i [x_i + y_i] + k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] ) = [b]\n\nNow, in the free abelian group, this equality implies that the coefficients of each [s] must be the same on both sides.\n\nLet’s define the \"left-hand side\" (LHS) and \"right-hand side\" (RHS):\n\nLHS: [a] + Σ (k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] - k_i [x_i + y_i])\n\nRHS: [b]\n\nTherefore, for each s in S, the coefficient of [s] in LHS must equal the coefficient in RHS.\n\nFor s = a: coefficient in LHS is 1, in RHS it's 0. To balance, there must be terms in the sum that subtract 1 from [a]. This can happen if, for some i, x_i + y_i = a and k_i is positive, so -k_i [x_i + y_i] contributes -k_i [a]. Similarly, if k_i is negative, +k_i [x_i + y_i] would contribute +|k_i| [a].\n\nSimilarly, for s = b: coefficient in RHS is 1, so in LHS it must also be 1. This requires that there are terms in the sum that add 1 to [b], which would come from k_i [x_i] or k_i [y_i] where x_i or y_i = b, or from -k_i [x_i + y_i] where x_i + y_i = b.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps by carefully analyzing the coefficients, we can find a common element c such that a + c = b + c.\n\nLet’s consider the following strategy: Let C be the sum of all elements that appear in the relations. That is, take all x_i, y_i, x_i + y_i from the relations in the sum. Then, add C to both a and b. The idea is that by adding these elements, we can use the relations to rewrite a + C and b + C in a way that they become equal.\n\nHowever, since C is a sum of elements from the relations, which are finite, this might work. But I need to make this precise.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each relation [x + y] = [x] + [y] allows us to decompose x + y into x and y. If we have multiple such decompositions, we can build a chain of decompositions that eventually connects a and b through some common elements.\n\nBut how to turn this into a proof that a + c = b + c?\n\nAnother idea: In the equation [a] = [b], we can add [c] to both sides for some c, getting [a + c] = [b + c]. If we can choose c such that both a + c and b + c can be decomposed using the relations into the same elements, then a + c = b + c in S.\n\nBut how to choose such a c? Perhaps c needs to be a sum of elements that appear in the relations used to equate [a] and [b].\n\nFor example, if the relations involve elements x1, y1, x2, y2, etc., then take c = x1 + y1 + x2 + y2 + ... Then, when we add c to both a and b, we can apply the relations to decompose c into its components, allowing a + c and b + c to be rewritten into the same expression.\n\nThis is similar to the standard technique in semigroup theory where to achieve cancellation, you add a common element to both sides. In this case, adding c would allow the relations to \"balance\" the equation.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Start with the equation [a] = [b] in G(S), implying [a] - [b] is a sum of relations.\n\n2. Express this as an equation in the free abelian group with generators from S.\n\n3. Collect all the elements involved in the relations and sum them to form c.\n\n4. Add c to both a and b, then use the relations to show that a + c and b + c can be transformed into the same element, hence a + c = b + c.\n\nThis seems plausible, but needs to be formalized.\n\nLet’s try to write this formally.\n\nSuppose [a] = [b] in G(S). Then, there exist finitely many pairs (x_i, y_i) in S and integers k_i such that:\n\n[a] - [b] = Σ k_i ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i])\n\nRearranged:\n\n[a] + Σ ( -k_i [x_i + y_i] + k_i [x_i] + k_i [y_i] ) = [b]\n\nLet’s separate the positive and negative k_i. Let’s suppose k_i are positive integers for some terms and negative for others. But since we can have negative coefficients, we can write this as a combination with positive and negative coefficients. However, in the free abelian group, we can move terms to the other side by changing signs. Let’s consider splitting the sum into positive and negative parts:\n\nΣ k_i ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i]) = Σ k_i [x_i + y_i] - Σ k_i [x_i] - Σ k_i [y_i]\n\nBut depending on the sign of k_i, these terms can be positive or negative. To simplify, let’s write this as:\n\nΣ_{i=1}^m [u_i + v_i] - Σ_{i=1}^m [u_i] - Σ_{i=1}^m [v_i] - Σ_{j=1}^n [p_j + q_j] + Σ_{j=1}^n [p_j] + Σ_{j=1}^n [q_j] = [a] - [b]\n\nBut this complicates things. Perhaps instead, consider that each term in the sum can be written as ±([x + y] - [x] - [y]). Let’s group all positive terms and negative terms:\n\nLet’s denote the positive terms as those where we have +([x + y] - [x] - [y]) and negative terms as -([x + y] - [x] - [y]) = -[x + y] + [x] + [y]\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n[a] - [b] = Σ_{i=1}^m ([x_i + y_i] - [x_i] - [y_i]) + Σ_{j=1}^n (-[p_j + q_j] + [p_j] + [q_j])\n\nRearranged:\n\n[a] + Σ_{i=1}^m ([x_i] + [y_i]) + Σ_{j=1}^n ([p_j + q_j]) = [b] + Σ_{i=1}^m [x_i + y_i] + Σ_{j=1}^n ([p_j] + [q_j])\n\nNow, this equation must hold in the free abelian group. Therefore, the multiset of elements on the left must equal the multiset on the right.\n\nLet’s define c as the sum of all elements involved in the relations. Specifically, let:\n\nc = Σ_{i=1}^m (x_i + y_i) + Σ_{j=1}^n (p_j + q_j)\n\nThen, add c to both a and b. That is, consider a + c and b + c.\n\nNow, let’s express a + c and b + c:\n\na + c = a + Σ_{i=1}^m (x_i + y_i) + Σ_{j=1}^n (p_j + q_j)\n\nb + c = b + Σ_{i=1}^m (x_i + y_i) + Σ_{j=1}^n (p_j + q_j)\n\nBut according to the equation in the free abelian group, the multiset of elements on the left (which includes a, x_i, y_i, p_j + q_j) must equal the multiset on the right (which includes b, x_i + y_i, p_j, q_j). \n\nTherefore, a + c can be rewritten using the relations as follows:\n\nFor each term in the sum Σ_{i=1}^m (x_i + y_i), we can replace it with x_i + y_i (which is already in the sum), so no change there. But on the left side of the equation, we have a plus Σ x_i and Σ y_i from the relations. Similarly, the right side has Σ x_i + y_i and Σ p_j + q_j.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps instead, by adding c to both a and b, and using the relations to decompose and recompose the elements, we can show that a + c = b + c.\n\nSpecifically, using the relations [x_i + y_i] = [x_i] + [y_i], we can break down the sums in c into their components. Similarly, using the inverse relations, we can combine components into sums.\n\nThe key insight is that by adding c, which is a sum of all the elements involved in the relations, we can apply the relations to both a + c and b + c to transform them into the same element.\n\nFor example, on the left side, a + c can be transformed by replacing the added c with its decomposed form using the relations, and similarly for b + c. Since the equation in the free abelian group requires that the decomposed forms of a + c and b + c are equal, this implies that a + c and b + c must be equal in S.\n\nTherefore, the element c constructed from the relations serves as the witness that a + c = b + c.\n\nThis completes the proof. The key steps are:\n\n1. Express [a] - [b] as a sum of relations in the free abelian group.\n\n2. Collect all the elements involved in these relations and define c as their sum.\n\n3. Add c to both a and b.\n\n4. Use the relations to decompose and recompose a + c and b + c, leading to the conclusion that they must be equal in S.\n\nThus, the required c exists.",
