I have tried prove $\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1+a}}\\ge \\frac{3a+1}{4\\sqrt{2}}$ Indeed,$\\frac{{{a}^{2}}}{1+a}\\ge \\frac{9{{a}^{2}}+6a+1}{32}$ $\\Leftrightarrow 32{{a}^{2}}\\ge 9{{a}^{2}}+6a+1+9{{a}^{3}}+6{{a}^{2}}+a$ \n$\\Leftrightarrow 9{{a}^{3}}-17{{a}^{2}}+7a+1\\le 0$ \n$\\Leftrightarrow 9{{\\left( a-1 \\right)}^{2}}\\left( a+\\frac{1}{9} \\right)\\le 0$ (!)\nIt is wrong.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the function for positive $x$:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x}}-\\frac1{\\sqrt 2}-\\frac3{4\\sqrt 2}\\log x$$ Note that $f(x) \\ge 0 \\implies f(a)+f(b)+f(c) \\ge 0 \\implies $ the given inequality.  Now\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{4x^2-3\\sqrt2 (x+1)^{3/2}+8x}{8x(x+1)^{3/2}}$$ We need to check the sign of the numerator, $4(x+1)^2-3\\sqrt2(x+1)^{3/2}-4$.  Using $y = \\sqrt{x+1}$, we get the numerator as $$4y^4-3\\sqrt2y^3-4 = (y-\\sqrt2)(4y^3+\\sqrt2y^2+2y+2\\sqrt2)$$ As the second factor is positive, the numerator's sign is given by $y-\\sqrt2$ which has the same sign as $x-1$, so $f'(x)< 0$ for $x < 1$ and $f'(x)> 0$ for $x> 1$.  Hence $f(x)\\ge f(1)=0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem following the given format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving three variables a, b, c with the condition that their product is 1. The user tried an approach that led to a contradiction, so they're seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c are positive real numbers, and their product abc equals 1. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per object. So the assumptions are:\n\n- a is a positive real number.\n- b is a positive real number.\n- c is a positive real number.\n- The product of a, b, and c is 1.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that the sum of a over sqrt(1+a), and similarly for b and c, is at least 3√2/2. I need to make sure the problem statement is correctly formatted without any extra information from the user's failed attempt. The user's own steps and the mention of their wrong direction should be excluded as per the example, which only included the original problem statement in the 'Problem' section. So the problem line will be the inequality they need to prove under the given assumptions.",
