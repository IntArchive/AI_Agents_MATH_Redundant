Now with the polar coordinate transform, \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} z^{s-1} \\mathrm{Ei}(-z)^{2} \\, dz\n&= 8 \\Gamma(s) \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\int_{0}^{\\sec\\theta} r^{2s-1}\\cos^{2s-1}\\theta\\sin^{2s-1}\\theta \\, drd\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{4 \\Gamma(s)}{s} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{\\sin^{2s-1}\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}\\,d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{2 \\Gamma(s)}{s} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{\\sin^{2s-2}\\theta}{1 - \\sin^{2}\\theta} \\cdot 2\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{2 \\Gamma(s)}{s} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{u^{s-1}}{1 - u} \\, du \\tag{3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2 \\Gamma(s)}{s} \\beta\\left(\\frac{1}{2} ; s, 0 \\right)\n\\end{align*} where $\\beta(x ; a, b)$ is the incomplete beta function and we used the substitution $u = \\sin^{2}\\theta$ at $(3)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem formatting task. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided helps clarify the expectations. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about a conjectural closed form for an integral involving the cube root of z and the square of the exponential integral function Ei(-z). The user provided the integral expression and mentioned it's a conjecture without proof, derived from non-rigorous methods. They also included the definition of the exponential integral Ei(z).\n\nThe task is to extract assumptions and the problem statement. The example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Let me parse the original problem.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity of z^(1/3) times [Ei(-z)]^2 dz. The conjecture is that this equals a specific expression involving Gamma function, arccos, log terms, and cube roots. The exponential integral Ei(z) is defined as the integral from -z to infinity of e^(-t)/t dt. \n\nLooking for assumptions: The problem states the conjecture, so the main assumption is the equality proposed. However, the original example included assumptions about variables (like n being an integer). Here, the integral is definite, from 0 to ∞, so perhaps the assumptions are about the functions involved and their properties. But in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but in the problem presented here, the integral is definite and the variables are integrated out. \n\nWait, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here beyond the integral setup. The problem is to prove the conjectured closed-form expression. The functions involved (Ei, Gamma, etc.) are standard, so perhaps the assumptions are about the convergence of the integral, or the domain of z. Alternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the integral's form. \n\nLooking at the example again, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user corrected it to only list n as an integer, then the problem statement included proving divisibility by 91. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and the problem was to prove it's divisible by 91. So perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the statement to prove. \n\nIn the current problem, the conjecture is the equality. The integral is defined for z from 0 to infinity, involving Ei squared. The exponential integral here is Ei(-z), so perhaps there's an assumption about the behavior of Ei(-z) in the integrand. However, the problem as stated doesn't list any conditions; it's just the integral. The user might need to state any implicit assumptions. For example, z is positive since the integral is from 0 to ∞, and the integrand involves the cube root of z, which is defined for z ≥ 0. Also, Ei(-z) is defined for z > 0, as the integral from -(-z) = z to infinity of e^{-t}/t dt. Wait, Ei(z) is defined for z ≠ 0, but here Ei(-z) would be for z > 0, since -z is negative. The exponential integral function Ei is usually defined differently for positive arguments, but in this case, the integral definition is given as Ei(z) = -∫_{-z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt. So for z > 0, -z is negative, so the integral from a negative number to infinity. The function is defined here, but perhaps there's an assumption about the convergence of the original integral. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. The user in the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's hypotheses. Here, the problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions might just be the integral's limits and the functions involved. But each assumption should address only one property or condition of one object. Let me think: \n\nAssumptions could be:\n\n- z is a positive real number (since integrating from 0 to infinity, and cube root of z is involved).\n\n- The exponential integral Ei(-z) is defined as per the given integral.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equality of the integral to the conjectured expression. Since the original problem states it's a conjecture derived from numerical methods, maybe the assumptions are the definitions and the validity of the integral's convergence. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem doesn't state any explicit conditions beyond the integral itself, maybe the assumptions are just the definitions. However, the example listed assumptions about n, which were part of the problem's hypothesis. In this case, the integral is over z from 0 to ∞, and the integrand is sqrt[3]{z}*(Ei(-z))^2. The conjecture is that this integral equals a specific combination of gamma functions, inverse trigonometric, and logarithmic terms. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. z is a positive real number. (Because the integral is from 0 to ∞ and cube root is defined.)\n\n2. The exponential integral Ei(-z) is defined as -∫_{-(-z)}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt = -∫_{z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt. Wait, the original definition given is Ei(z) = -∫_{-z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt. So Ei(-z) would be -∫_{z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt. But perhaps this is part of the definition, so the assumption would involve the definition of Ei(-z).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about the variable (n being integer). Here, maybe the assumption is about the function Ei being defined as per the given integral. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions are the components of the integral and the conjecture. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem as posed doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the integral's existence and the functions involved. Since the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ z^(1/3) [Ei(-z)]² dz converges.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equality, so maybe the only assumption is that the integral is as defined. Alternatively, the problem might not need explicit assumptions beyond what's given. However, the example included assumptions even when the problem was a general statement. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became the assumption \"n is an integer\" and then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but in that example, the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user provided it as their own example. So maybe in that case, the user extracted \"n is an integer\" from the original statement \"for every integer n\", and added \"n is divisible by 7\" as a separate assumption, perhaps mistakenly. Because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe that example was a different problem where the user had to split the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions. But perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are just the components necessary for the problem to make sense.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, maybe in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- z is a real number such that z > 0.\n\n- Ei(-z) is defined as the exponential integral function given by the integral from z to infinity of e^{-t}/t dt.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- z is a positive real number.\n\n- The exponential integral function Ei(-z) is defined as -∫_{z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's integral is over z from 0 to ∞, so z is integrated out. Wait, but the integral is definite, so maybe there's no variable assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any variable assumptions and the integral is the main object. In that case, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, but the format requires listing assumptions. If the example included assumptions even when the problem was general, maybe I need to list the necessary conditions for the integral to be valid. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ z^(1/3) [Ei(-z)]² dz converges.\n\nBut how do I know that's an assumption? The problem states that the conjecture came from numerical fitting, so perhaps the integral does converge, but the user is asking to prove the equality. Alternatively, the problem might assume that the integral exists and is equal to the given expression. But perhaps the user wants to structure the problem by stating the integral's form and the conjecture.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions used in the problem. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The exponential integral function Ei(z) is defined as -∫_{-z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\nBut that's part of the problem's given information. The user included the definition of Ei(z) in the question, so maybe that's part of the problem's setup, hence an assumption. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The exponential integral Ei(z) is defined as -∫_{-z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ z^(1/3) [Ei(-z)]² dz is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that this integral equals the given expression involving Gamma, arccos, etc.\n\nWait, but the example's assumptions were about the variables. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the functions and the integral's setup. Each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Ei(z) is the exponential integral defined by -∫_{-z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\n- The integral is taken over z from 0 to ∞.\n\n- The integrand is z^(1/3) [Ei(-z)]².\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equality. However, the example didn't include all the terms of the expression as assumptions. So maybe only the key conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem as stated has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's form and the definition of Ei. Since the problem is a conjecture, the assumptions might just be the components necessary to state the problem.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The exponential integral function Ei(z) is defined as -∫_{-z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n∫₀^∞ z^(1/3) Ei²(-z) dz equals (3/4) Γ(4/3) [√3 arccos((5 - 3∛2)/2) - ln(1 + 3∛2 - 3∛4) - 3∛4]\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, since the integral is definite, there are no variables left; it's just an equality between two expressions. So maybe the only assumption is the definition of Ei(z). Alternatively, the problem may not require assumptions beyond the integral's setup, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ √[3]{z} [Ei(-z)]² dz converges.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals the given closed-form expression.\n\nBut the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's hypothesis, not the proof's requirements. In the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumption was that n is an integer. So in this case, the problem is to prove the equality, and the assumptions would include the definitions and conditions needed to state the integral.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the integral equals the expression, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of Ei(z). But the problem as stated in the question includes the definition of Ei(z), so that should be an assumption.\n\nWait, the original problem states:\n\n\"where Ei z is the exponential integral:\n\nEi z = -∫_{-z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt.\"\n\nSo the assumption here is the definition of Ei(z). Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that Ei(z) is defined as such. Additionally, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so perhaps another assumption is that z is a positive real variable, but that's part of the integral's limits.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each about one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Ei(z) is defined as -∫_{-z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\n- The variable z is integrated from 0 to ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral ∫₀^∞ z^(1/3) Ei²(-z) dz equals the conjectured expression.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, but the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is just n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That's confusing. Perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as part of the instructions. Therefore, maybe the user expects that any conditions in the problem are split into separate assumptions. \n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to ∞, and the integrand is z^(1/3) Ei²(-z). The conjecture is that it equals a certain expression. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over z from 0 to infinity.\n\n- The integrand is z^(1/3) times the square of the exponential integral Ei(-z).\n\n- Ei(z) is defined as -∫_{-z}^∞ e^{-t}/t dt.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- For the integral ∫₀^∞ √[3]{z} [Ei(-z)]² dz, z is a positive real number.\n\n- The exponential integral Ei(-z) is defined as -∫_{z}^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals the conjectured closed-form expression.\n\nYes, that seems better. Each assumption is a single line, about one object. The first assumption is about the domain of z in the integral (z > 0), and the second is about the definition of Ei(-z).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nz is a positive real number,\nThe exponential integral $\\operatorname{Ei}(-z)$ is defined as $-\\int_{z}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$.\nProblem: \nProve that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\sqrt[3]{z}\\ \\operatorname{Ei}^2(-z)\\,dz = \\frac{3}{4}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{3}\\,\\arccos\\frac{5-3\\,\\sqrt[3]{2}}{2}-\\ln\\left(1+3\\,\\sqrt[3]{2}-3\\,\\sqrt[3]{4}\\right)-3\\,\\sqrt[3]{4}\\right).$$\n###",
