    "Content": "I have a question concerning one of the exercises of Hartshorne, Ch. II. Namely: Exercise 3.7 about gerneically finite morphisms. A morphism $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ with Y irreducible and $\\eta$ generic point of Y, is called generically finite, if $f^{-1}(\\eta)$ is a finite set. Now let $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ be a dominant, generically finite morphism of finite type of integral schemes. Show that there is an open dense subset $U \\subseteq Y$ sth. $f^{-1}(U) \\rightarrow U$ is finite. As a hint, one should prove first that the function field of $X$ is a finite field extension of the function field of $Y$. I have started with the affine case: $X = \\operatorname{Spec}\\ A$, $Y = \\operatorname{Spec}\\ B$ with function fields $K$ resp. $L$. The assertion that $K$ now is a finite field extension of $L$ follows from Noether's Normalization theorem and Zariski's Lemma. But how can I proceed from there? I would be grateful for an idea to help me go on. Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a diagram of the algebraic setup. All the arrows are inclusions.\n$$\n\\require{AMScd}\n\\begin{CD}\nA @>>> A \\otimes_B L @>>> K\\\\\n@AAA @AAA\\\\\nB @>>>L\n\\end{CD}\n$$\nSince $K$ is finite over $L$ you know that algebra generators for $A$ over $B$ satisfy monic polynomials with coefficients in $L$. If you localize $B$ at a well-chosen element $f$ you can upgrade this statement!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem from Hartshorne. The user is working on Exercise II.3.7 about generically finite morphisms. The problem states: given a dominant, generically finite morphism of finite type between integral schemes f: X → Y, show there's an open dense subset U of Y such that the preimage f^{-1}(U) mapped to U is finite. The hint suggests proving the function field of X is a finite extension of Y's function field first.\n\nThe user started with the affine case, assuming X=Spec A and Y=Spec B, where the function fields K and L are such that K is a finite extension of L by Noether's Normalization and Zariski's Lemma. They're stuck on how to proceed from there.\n\nSo, the assumptions here need to be listed. Let me see. The morphism f is dominant, which for schemes means the image is dense. Since Y is irreducible, dominant implies the morphism is surjective on generic points. Then, generically finite means that the fiber over the generic point η of Y is finite. The morphism is of finite type, which is a technical condition in algebraic geometry meaning locally finite presentation and quasi-compact. Both X and Y are integral schemes, so they are irreducible and reduced.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f: X → Y is a morphism of integral schemes.\n2. f is dominant.\n3. f is generically finite, i.e., the fiber over the generic point η of Y is finite.\n4. f is of finite type.\n\nThe problem is to show there exists an open dense subset U ⊆ Y such that the restriction f^{-1}(U) → U is finite.\n\nWait, the original problem statement in the user's question mentions \"integral schemes\" and the conditions on f. So, the assumptions should each address one property applied to one object. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions should be:\n\n- X and Y are integral schemes. (Each is a single object, integral implies irreducible and reduced, so maybe this is considered one property per scheme? But the user might combine them. Wait, but the problem says \"integral schemes\", so both X and Y are integral. Since each is a separate object, maybe split into two assumptions: X is an integral scheme, Y is an integral scheme. But maybe the problem states \"morphism of integral schemes\", which could be considered a single assumption about both X and Y. However, the format says each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is an integral scheme,\n\nY is an integral scheme,\n\nf: X → Y is a dominant morphism,\n\nf: X → Y is a generically finite morphism,\n\nf: X → Y is a morphism of finite type.\n\nWait, but \"morphism of finite type\" is a single condition on f. Similarly, \"dominant\" is another condition on f. So each of these is a separate assumption line. The problem is to structure each assumption line as one property/condition on one object.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nX is an integral scheme,\n\nY is an integral scheme,\n\nf: X → Y is dominant,\n\nf: X → Y is generically finite,\n\nf: X → Y is of finite type.\n\nThen the problem statement is to show there exists an open dense subset U ⊆ Y such that f^{-1}(U) → U is finite.\n\nIn the example given, the user included assumptions as separate lines. So here, the integrality of X and Y are separate, and each condition on f (dominant, generically finite, finite type) are separate lines.\n\nI think that's correct. The original problem doesn't assume anything else. So the formatted problem would list each of these assumptions.",
