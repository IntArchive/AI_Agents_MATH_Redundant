    "Content": "Prove that if $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n>0$ , then $$(1+x_1)(1+x_1+x_2)\\ldots(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_n) \\ge \\sqrt{(n+1)^{n+1}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_n}.$$ I've tried using the AM-GM inequality: $$(1+x_1)(1+x_1+x_2)\\ldots(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_n) \\ge (n+1)!\\sqrt{x_1}\\sqrt[3]{x_1x_2}\\ldots\\sqrt[n+1]{x_1x_2\\ldots x_n}$$ But this obviously leads to nowhere. I can try to prove this by using mathematical induction. If the inequality is true for $n=k$ , then, if we prove that the inequality is true for $n=k+1$ , everything's proved if we prove one case, e.g. when n=1. When n=1, then it is obvious that the inequality holds: $$1+x \\ge 2\\sqrt{x}$$ So if n=k+1, then $$(1+x_1)(1+x_1+x_2)\\ldots(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_{k+1}) \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_{k+1}}$$ But we know that $$(1+x_1)(1+x_1+x_2)\\ldots(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_k) \\ge \\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_k}$$ So we can try proving that $$(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_{k+1})\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_k} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_{k+1}}$$ We can divide both sides by $\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_k}$ (it's greater than $0$ , so we can do this). We get: $$(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_{k+1})\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}\\sqrt{x_{k+1}}\\tag{1}$$ We could use AM-GM here to try to continue: $$(k+2)\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_{k+1}}\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}\\sqrt{x_{k+1}}$$ Now we can divide everything by $\\sqrt{x_{k+1}}$ (it's greater than $0$ ). We get: $$(k+2)\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_k}\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}$$ Now we can divide everything by $k+2$ ( $n \\in \\mathbb N$ , so obviously $k \\in \\mathbb N \\Rightarrow k>0$ ). We get: $$\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_k}\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^k}$$ We could square both sides now (both sides are greater than $0$ , so that changes nothing). We get: $$x_1x_2\\ldots x_k(k+1)^{k+1} \\ge (k+2)^k$$ But if k=1, then $$4x \\ge 3$$ So I've reduced the LHS too much. Forget the steps after $(1)$ . We can still prove that: $$(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_{k+1})\\sqrt{(k+1)^{k+1}} \\ge \\sqrt{(k+2)^{k+2}}\\sqrt{x_{k+1}}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving positive real numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ. The user wants the assumptions and the problem clearly laid out.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states \"if x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ > 0\", so the main assumption is that all these variables are positive. However, the example provided in the instruction shows that each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, they listed \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. \n\nIn this case, the variables x₁ through xₙ are all positive. Since each variable is an element of the sequence, but the problem states \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ > 0\", this is a single condition applied to all variables collectively. However, according to the example's structure, each assumption should be a single property for one object. But here, all variables are under one condition. Maybe I need to list each x_i as positive? But that would be redundant since they are all covered by the same condition. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to state that each x_i is positive. Wait, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So if the problem says x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are all positive, then maybe each x_i is positive. But that's n assumptions. However, the problem might consider \"all x_i are positive\" as a single assumption. But the example separated two conditions on the same object (n). Here, the variables are different objects but with the same condition. The user's example had a problem where n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, maybe the assumption should be that each x_i is positive. But since the original problem states \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ >0\", which is a collective statement, but to follow the format, perhaps we need to list each x_i as positive. But that's not practical if n is arbitrary. Wait, the original example had a problem with n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumption is that each x_i is positive. But how to express that concisely? The original problem says \"if x₁,x₂,…,x_n>0\", so maybe the correct way is to state \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers\". Each variable is positive. But since they are listed together, maybe that's one assumption. But the example had two separate assumptions for the same object (n). Hmm. Wait, the example had two separate conditions on n: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem has one condition: all x_i are positive. So perhaps that's a single assumption. But the instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object\". So if the object is \"each x_i\", then the condition is \"positive\", but since there are multiple x_i's, it's one condition applied to all. But maybe the problem considers all variables collectively as one object? Not sure. The example given by the user in the instruction had two assumptions on n. So in this case, the original problem has a single assumption: all x_i are positive. Therefore, in the assumption section, it should be one line: \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers\". But the example had multiple lines for each condition. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user might have included that n is divisible by 7 as part of the problem. Wait, the original example's formatted problem lists assumptions as n being an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user added an extra assumption? Wait, the original example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then why is the assumption that n is divisible by 7? Maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, maybe the original problem in the example actually had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the original problem had n being an integer divisible by 7, but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". That would be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is structured to split the conditions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had n being an integer, and the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91, which factors into 13*7. So maybe n needs to be an integer divisible by both 7 and 13? But in the example, the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. That seems like an error in the example. Maybe the example was incorrect. But regardless, the instruction says that in the formatted problem, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original problem states \"if x₁,x₂,…,x_n>0\", so the only assumption is that each x_i is a positive real number. But since they are listed collectively, perhaps we can write that as one assumption: \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers\". However, if the format requires each assumption to apply to one object, then since there are n variables, but n is arbitrary, we can't list each x_i separately. So the correct way is to state the collective assumption. Therefore, the assumption line would be \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers\". Then the problem is to prove the inequality given. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nx₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$(1+x_1)(1+x_1+x_2)\\ldots(1+x_1+x_2+\\ldots+x_n) \\ge \\sqrt{(n+1)^{n+1}}\\sqrt{x_1x_2\\ldots x_n}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, they split the assumptions into two lines even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Maybe in that example, the user incorrectly added an assumption. But given that the instruction says each assumption is a single property for one object, perhaps in the current problem, even though the original problem says \"if x₁,...,xₙ>0\", which is a single condition, but according to the example, we need to split into individual assumptions. But how? Since all x_i are positive, and there's no other condition. So maybe it's one assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption line as \"x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are positive real numbers\" and the problem as stated. That should be correct.",
