    "Content": "This is  homework problem and the very premise has me stumped. It's in a text on PDE. The exercise says to show that $ f(x) = x^2 $ is not uniformly continuous on the real line. But every definition I know says that it is a continuous function, and unless you attach some special condition, like restricting the interval or making it a periodic function (perhaps saying $f(x-2) = f(x)$ or some such) it's by definition continuous. There's always a derivative since $f'(x) = 2x$. The preceding chapter is about Drichelet and the like, as an extension of Fourier series, so I am guessing that a Fourier expansion does something here but every proof of the proposition seems to have nothing to do with Fourier series in the slightest. So I am pretty lost here. This whole question seems utterly nonsensical.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is continuous. However, it is not uniformly continuous. Suppose it were; then for every $\\epsilon$, there exists a $\\delta$ for which $$|x - y| < \\delta \\implies |x^2 - y^2| < \\epsilon$$ However, consider $\\epsilon = 1$; if such $\\delta$ existed and $y = x + \\frac{\\delta}{2}$, we would find that $$|x^2 - (x + \\frac{\\delta}{2})^2| < 1$$ for every real $x$; however, this would imply that $$|x \\delta + \\frac{\\delta^2}{4}| < 1$$ which is a clear contradiction, since we can  choose $x$ large.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange about proving that f(x) = x² is not uniformly continuous on the real line. Let me start by understanding the original question and the user's confusion.\n\nFirst, the user is confused because they know f(x) = x² is continuous everywhere, but the problem states it's not uniformly continuous. They mention definitions of continuity and derivatives, so maybe they're conflating uniform continuity with regular continuity. Uniform continuity is a stronger condition, requiring that the delta works for all points in the domain, not just each point individually. The real line is not compact, and functions like x² can become steeper without bound, which might lead to failure of uniform continuity.\n\nLooking at the example given in the format, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't mention any such assumptions. Wait, the original problem here is about f(x) = x² on the real line. The key here is that uniform continuity has different criteria than pointwise continuity. The problem likely doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the function and domain, but maybe the user is missing some implicit conditions?\n\nWait, the problem is to show f(x) = x² is not uniformly continuous on ℝ. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x².\n- The domain of f is the real line ℝ.\n- The continuity is considered in the context of uniform continuity.\n\nBut the user is confused because they think continuity implies uniform continuity, which isn't the case. The problem's assumptions don't add extra conditions; they just state the function and domain. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the function and its domain. The problem is to prove it's not uniformly continuous there.\n\nWait, the example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in this case, the problem doesn't have such numeric conditions. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is defined by f(x) = x² for all real x,\nThe domain of f is the real line.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is not uniformly continuous on the real line.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions the exercise is from a PDE text, but the problem itself doesn't involve any PDE aspects. So perhaps the key is just the function and domain. The user is confused because they think continuity implies uniform continuity, which isn't the case on non-compact domains. The problem is straightforward: given f(x)=x² on ℝ, show it's not uniformly continuous.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the function's definition and domain as assumptions, then the problem statement. The user's confusion about Fourier series or periodicity isn't part of the problem's assumptions; the problem is purely about uniform continuity on ℝ.",
