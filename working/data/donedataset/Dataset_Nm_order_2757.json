    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. So the question is to prove that the ceiling of n/m is equal to the floor of (n + m - 1)/m, where m and n are natural numbers. Hmm, ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer, and floor rounds down. I need to show these two expressions are the same.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of floor and ceiling functions. For any real number x, the ceiling of x is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. The floor of x is the largest integer less than or equal to x. So, if I can express n/m in terms that when I add m-1 and divide by m, taking the floor gives the same result as the ceiling of n/m.\n\nLet me try some examples. Suppose m = 3, n = 5. Then ceiling(5/3) = 2. On the other side, (5 + 3 - 1)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333..., floor of that is 2. So they match. Another example: n = 4, m = 2. Ceiling(4/2) = 2. (4 + 2 -1)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5, floor is 2. Still matches. What about when n is a multiple of m? Let's say n = 6, m = 3. Ceiling(6/3) = 2. (6 + 3 -1)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666..., floor is 2. Still works. Wait, but in this case, n/m is exactly 2, so ceiling is 2. The other side gives 8/3, which is 2.666..., floor is 2. So even when n divides m exactly, it still works. Hmm.\n\nWhat if n is less than m? Let's say n = 2, m = 5. Ceiling(2/5) = 1. (2 + 5 -1)/5 = 6/5 = 1.2, floor is 1. Okay, still matches. So all these examples work. So the formula seems to hold in cases where n/m is integer, or has a fractional part. So the key is probably to express n as m*q + r, where 0 ≤ r < m. Then n/m = q + r/m. The ceiling of that would be q + 1 if r > 0, otherwise q. Now, let's compute the other side: (n + m -1)/m. Substituting n = m*q + r, we get (m*q + r + m -1)/m = q + (r + m -1)/m. So (r + m -1)/m is equal to 1 + (r -1)/m. Wait, but since r is between 0 and m-1, (r -1) is between -1 and m-2. So (r + m -1)/m = (m -1 + r)/m = 1 + (r -1)/m. But floor(q + 1 + (r -1)/m) = q + 1 + floor((r -1)/m). Since r is between 0 and m-1, (r -1)/m is between (-1)/m and (m-2)/m. Since (m-2)/m is less than 1, the floor of that is either -1 or 0. But when r = 0, (r -1)/m = -1/m, floor is -1. So then floor(q + 1 -1/m) = q + 0? Wait, no. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, if n = m*q + r, then (n + m -1)/m = q + (r + m -1)/m = q + 1 + (r -1)/m. The floor of that is q + 1 + floor((r -1)/m). Now, if r ≥ 1, then (r -1)/m is ≥ 0/m = 0, and since r < m, (r -1)/m < (m-1 -1)/m = (m-2)/m < 1. So floor((r -1)/m) is 0. Therefore, floor of the entire expression is q +1 +0 = q +1. If r =0, then (r -1)/m = -1/m, so floor(-1/m) is -1. So the entire floor becomes q +1 -1 = q. \n\nBut the ceiling(n/m) when r =0 is ceiling(q +0) = q. When r >0, ceiling(q + r/m) = q +1. Therefore, in both cases, the floor of (n + m -1)/m is equal to ceiling(n/m). Therefore, the equality holds. So that's the proof.\n\nBut let me check when r =0. For example, n=6, m=3. Then r=0. Ceiling(6/3)=2. The other side: (6 +3 -1)/3=8/3≈2.666, floor is 2. Which matches. When r=1, n=4, m=3. Ceiling(4/3)=2. (4+3-1)/3=6/3=2, floor is 2. Wait, 6/3 is exactly 2. So floor(2)=2. Hmm. Wait, but in this case, r=1, so (r -1)/m=0/m=0. So floor(q +1 +0)=q+1. Which is 1 +1=2. Correct. Another example: n=5, m=3, r=2. (5+3-1)/3=7/3≈2.333, floor is2. Ceiling(5/3)=2. So matches. When r=0, n=3, m=3. Ceiling(1)=1. (3+3-1)/3=5/3≈1.666, floor is1. So matches. Therefore, the formula works in all cases. So the key idea is expressing n as m*q + r and analyzing both sides based on the remainder r. Therefore, the proof follows by considering the division with remainder.",
