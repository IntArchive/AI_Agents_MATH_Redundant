    "Content": "In the integers, it follows almost immediately from the division theorem and the fact that $a \\mid x,y \\implies a \\mid ux + vy$ for any $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ that the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ divides any other common multiple. In contrast, proving $e\\mid a,b \\implies e\\mid\\gcd(a,b)$ seems to be more difficult. In Elementary Number Theory by Jones & Jones, they do not try to prove this fact until establishing Bezout's identity. This Wikipedia page has a proof without Bezout's identity, but it is convoluted to my eyes. I tried my hand at it, and what I got seems no cleaner: Proposition: If $e \\mid a,b$ , then $e \\mid \\gcd(a,b)$ . Proof: Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$ . Then if $e \\nmid d$ , by the division theorem there's some $q$ and $c$ such that $d = qe + c$ with $0 < c < r$ . We have $a = k_1 d$ and $b = k_2 d$ , so by substituting we obtain $a = k_1 (qe + c)$ and $b = k_2 (qe + c)$ . Since $e$ divides both $a$ and $b$ , it must divide both $k_1 c$ and $k_2 c$ as well. This implies that both $k_1 c$ and $k_2 c$ are common multiples of $c$ and $r$ . Now let $l = \\operatorname{lcm}(r, c)$ . $l$ divides both $k_1 c$ and $k_2 c$ . Since $l = \\phi c$ for some $\\phi$ , we have $\\phi | k_1, k_2$ , so $d \\phi | a, b$ . But we must have $\\phi > 1$ otherwise $l = c$ , implying $r \\mid c$ , which could not be the case since $c < r$ . So $d \\phi$ is a common divisor greater than $d$ , which is a contradiction. $\\Box$ Question: Is there a cleaner proof I'm missing, or is this seemingly elementary proposition just not very easy to prove without using Bezout's identity?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One easy and insightful way is to use the proof below. It essentially constructs $\\rm\\,gcd\\,$ from $\\rm\\,lcm\\,$ by employing duality between minimal and maximal elements - see the Remark below.  This is essentially how the linked Wikipedia proof works, but there the innate duality is obfuscated by the presentation. Below is a proof structured so that this fundamental duality is brought to the fore. $\\rm{\\bf Theorem}\\quad c\\mid a,b\\iff c\\mid d,\\ \\ $ for $\\rm\\ \\ d = ab/lcm(a,b).\\ $ $\\rm\\color{#0a0}{Hence}$ $\\rm\\ d = gcd(a,b)$ $\\rm{\\bf Proof}\\qquad\\ \\ \\, c\\mid a,b \\iff a,b\\mid ab/c \\iff lcm(a,b)\\mid ab/c \\iff c\\mid ab/lcm(a,b)$ $\\rm\\color{#0a0}{Generally}\\,$ if $\\rm\\, c\\mid a,b\\iff c\\mid d\\ $ then $\\rm\\ d = \\gcd(a,b)\\ $ up to unit factors, i.e. they're associate (this is the definition of a gcd $\\rm\\,d\\,$ of $\\rm\\,a,b\\,$ in an integral domain).

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants a proof that if a number e divides both a and b, then e must divide their greatest common divisor (gcd), without using Bezout's identity. The existing proofs they mention either use Bezout or are considered convoluted. Their own proof uses the division theorem and leads to a contradiction by finding a larger common divisor than the gcd, which isn't possible. The question is asking if there's a cleaner way to do this without Bezout.\n\nFirst, let's understand the assumptions here. The problem states that e is a common divisor of a and b, so by definition, e divides both a and b. The gcd of a and b is d. The goal is to show that e divides d. The challenge is to do this without referencing Bezout's identity, which typically involves expressing gcd(a,b) as a linear combination of a and b.\n\nThe user’s own proof assumes d = gcd(a,b) and then supposes that e doesn't divide d. Then, using the division theorem, they write d as qe + c with 0 < c < e. Substituting back into a and b, they find that c must be a common divisor, leading to a contradiction because c is smaller than e but then the gcd would be larger, which isn't possible. However, the user feels this is convoluted and wants a simpler approach.\n\nSo, what's the key property here? The gcd is the greatest common divisor, meaning any other common divisor must divide it. To show this without Bezout, maybe we can use the properties of gcd related to the division theorem or prime factorization. Alternatively, perhaps using the least common multiple (lcm) since the user mentioned that lcm divides any other common multiple, which is straightforward. But the gcd part is trickier.\n\nAnother approach could be using the prime factorizations of a and b. The gcd is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes. If e divides both a and b, then all primes in e's factorization are in both a and b, and their exponents in e are less than or equal to those in gcd(a,b). Therefore, e must divide gcd(a,b). But does this approach avoid Bezout? Yes, because it's based on prime factorization, which is fundamental. However, does the user consider prime factorization acceptable? The original problem didn't mention it, but maybe that's a way.\n\nAlternatively, use the property that gcd(a,b) is the unique positive divisor of a and b that is divisible by every common divisor. This is actually the definition sometimes, but maybe that's circular. Wait, if we define gcd as the greatest common divisor in terms of divisibility, then showing that every common divisor divides it is necessary. But how to do that without Bezout?\n\nWait, maybe using the division algorithm step by step. Let's think about the Euclidean algorithm. The gcd can be found by repeatedly applying the division theorem. If e divides a and b, then it divides each remainder in the Euclidean algorithm steps. Hence, it divides the last non-zero remainder, which is the gcd. Therefore, e divides gcd(a,b). But does the Euclidean algorithm rely on Bezout's identity? The standard proof of the Euclidean algorithm does show that the last remainder is a linear combination, hence Bezout, but perhaps we can use the algorithm's steps without invoking Bezout explicitly.\n\nWait, here's an idea. The Euclidean algorithm works by applying division with remainder: gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b), and so on. If e divides a and b, then e divides a mod b (since a mod b = a - qb, and e divides a and b, so divides a - qb). Therefore, e divides all subsequent remainders, including the final gcd. This doesn't require Bezout, just the properties of divisibility. That seems clean. So, perhaps the proof using the Euclidean algorithm steps without explicitly forming the linear combination would be acceptable.\n\nBut does the user consider the Euclidean algorithm as separate from Bezout? Because Bezout is often derived from the Euclidean algorithm. However, the logic here is that if e divides a and b, then it divides all remainders in the Euclidean steps, hence divides the gcd. This doesn't require expressing the gcd as a linear combination, just using the divisibility properties. That might be the concise proof the user is looking for.\n\nSo, to structure the problem based on this. The assumptions are that e divides both a and b, and that gcd(a,b) exists. The problem is to prove that e divides gcd(a,b) without using Bezout's identity. The answer could involve the Euclidean algorithm's properties or prime factorization.\n\nBut the user's example formatted problem is extracting assumptions and restating the problem. Let me look at their example again. The original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the problem, the user had n as any integer, but the formatted assumption added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like maybe the user made a mistake, but the example shows that assumptions are conditions given in the problem. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user had an error in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That contradicts. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user's instruction is to list the assumptions from the problem. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be that e divides a and e divides b. The problem is to prove e divides gcd(a,b).\n\nSo, applying the format:\n\nAssumption: e divides a,\n\nAssumption: e divides b,\n\nProblem: Prove that e divides gcd(a, b).\n\nBut the original problem's context includes that it's in the integers and that the proof should avoid Bezout's identity. But according to the example, the assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one condition applied to one object. So in the original question, the problem is to prove that if e divides a and b, then e divides gcd(a,b). So the assumptions are e divides a, e divides b. The problem is to prove e divides gcd(a,b).\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: e divides a,\nAssumption: e divides b,\nProblem: Prove that e divides $\\gcd(a, b)$.\n###\n\nBut the user's example had a mistake, but according to their instruction, we should follow the format. Therefore, the answer should be as above.",
