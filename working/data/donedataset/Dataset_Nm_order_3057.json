    "Content": "I'm trying to solve the following problem from Apostol, Calculus, Volume I (p. 284) and could use some help: Prove:\n  $$\\arctan x = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\dfrac{(-1)^k x^{2k+1}}{2k+1} + E_{2n} (x), \\qquad |E_{2n} (x)| \\leq \\dfrac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\quad \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1.$$ Getting the Taylor expansion of $\\arctan x$ is straightforward (and is worked out as an example in the text). My question : how do I prove the requested bound on the error term? This exercise is in the section immediately following the proof and examples of this Theorem (and some slight variations) for estimating the error term which states that: If the $(n+1)$st derivative of $f$ satisfies\n$$ m \\leq f^{(n+1)}(t) \\leq M$$\nthen \n$$ m \\dfrac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\leq E_n (x) \\leq M \\dfrac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\quad \\text{if } x > a,$$\nand\n$$ m \\dfrac{(a-x)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\leq (-1)^{n+1} E_n (x) \\leq M \\dfrac{(a-x)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \\quad \\text{if } x < a.$$ In order to apply this I need to get bounds $m$ and $M$ on the $(n+1)st$ derivative of $\\arctan x$, which I cannot seem to arrive at. Updated :Taking successive derivatives, I find: $$\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= \\dfrac{1}{1+x^2}\\\\\nf''(x) &= \\dfrac{-2x}{(1+x^2)^2}\\\\\nf^{(3)} (x) &= \\dfrac{6 (x^2 - 1/3)}{(1+x^2)^3}\\\\\nf^{(4)} (x) &= \\dfrac{-24 x (x^2 - 1)}{(1+x^2)^4}\\\\\nf^{(5)} (x) &= \\dfrac{120 (x^4 - 2x^2 + 1/5)}{(1+x^2)^5}\n\\end{align*}$$ I should add, from the formula for $|E_{2n} (x)|$ that we are trying to prove it seems the bound $M$ must be $(2n)!$. So, it seems clear the $n!$ term I want is there, but I can't seem to figure out how to explicitly bound this.  It seems that it should be rather obvious from here, but I'm having trouble. Any help is appreciated (hints or full solutions are equally welcome).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We know $$\\begin{align*}\n\\arctan (x) & = \\int_0^x \\dfrac{1}{1+t^2} dt \\\\\n& = \\int_0^x \\left[1 - t^2 + t^4 - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} t^{2(n-1)} + \\dfrac{(-1)^{n} t^{2n}}{1+t^2} \\right] dt\\\\\n& = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \\dfrac{(-1)^k x^{2k+1}}{2k+1} + (-1)^{n}\\int_0^x \\dfrac{t^{2n}}{1+t^2} dt\\\\\n& = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \\dfrac{(-1)^k x^{2k+1}}{2k+1} + E_{2n}(x)\n\\end{align*}$$ Hence, we have $E_{2n} (x) = \\displaystyle{(-1)^{n}\\int_0^x \\dfrac{t^{2n}}{1+t^2} dt}$ so we are just trying to bound the integral.  So, we have $$\\begin{align*}\n|E_{2n} (x)| & = \\left|(-1)^{n}\\int_0^x \\dfrac{t^{2n}}{1+t^2} dt\\right|\\\\\n& = \\int_0^x \\dfrac{t^{2n}}{1+t^2} dt \\qquad (\\text{the integrand } \\geq 0 \\text{ for } t \\in [0,1])\\\\\n& \\leq \\int_0^x t^{2n} dt \\qquad \\qquad  \\left(t \\in [0,1] \\implies t^{2n} \\geq \\dfrac{t^{2n}}{1+t^2}\\right)\\\\\n& = \\dfrac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}\n\\end{align*}$$ Which is the bound we were looking for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this problem according to the specified format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving a bound for the error term in the Taylor expansion of arctan x. The user mentioned Apostol's Calculus problem where they need to show that the error term E_{2n}(x) satisfies |E_{2n}(x)| ≤ x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The original problem states that arctan x is equal to its Taylor series expansion up to the n-1 term plus the error term E_{2n}(x). The conditions given are that the bound holds when 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Also, the user refers to a theorem in Apostol which requires bounds on the (n+1)th derivative of the function. \n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function considered is arctan x.\n2. The Taylor expansion of arctan x is considered around a certain point (probably a=0 since it's the Maclaurin series).\n3. The error term E_{2n}(x) is the remainder after the sum up to k=n-1.\n4. The interval of interest is 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n5. The theorem from Apostol requires bounding the (2n+1)th derivative of arctan x (since the error term is E_{2n}(x), which would correspond to the (2n+1)th derivative in the Taylor remainder).\n\nWait, but in the theorem mentioned, the error term E_n(x) is related to the (n+1)th derivative. Here, the error term is E_{2n}(x), so that would correspond to the (2n+1)th derivative. Therefore, the user needs to bound the (2n+1)th derivative of arctan x on the interval [0,1]. \n\nSo the assumptions should list each relevant condition. Let me check the original problem again. The problem states that arctan x is expanded as the sum from k=0 to n-1 of (-1)^k x^{2k+1}/(2k+1) plus E_{2n}(x), and the error term's absolute value is bounded by x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) when 0 ≤x ≤1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include:\n\n- arctan x is expanded in its Taylor series about a=0 (since it's the Maclaurin series).\n- The expansion is up to degree 2n-1 (since the sum goes up to k=n-1, giving terms x^{2(n-1)+1} = x^{2n -1}), so the highest term is x^{2n -1}. Then the error term E_{2n}(x) is the remainder after this expansion.\n- The interval is 0 ≤ x ≤1.\n- The theorem requires bounds on the (2n+1)th derivative of arctan x on this interval.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user has derived some derivatives but is stuck on bounding them. The key here is to apply the theorem from Apostol, which needs the (n+1)th derivative bounded. However, in the problem, the error term is E_{2n}(x), so n in the theorem corresponds to 2n here. Therefore, the (2n +1)th derivative is needed.\n\nSo the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function is arctan x,\n- The Taylor expansion of arctan x is considered at a=0,\n- The error term E_{2n}(x) is the remainder after the (2n)th Taylor polynomial,\n- The interval is 0 ≤ x ≤ 1,\n- The (2n+1)th derivative of arctan x is bounded on the interval [0,1].\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is instructed to prove the bound on the error term. So maybe the assumptions are the given conditions for applying the theorem. Let me check the example given:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in this case, the assumptions would be the given conditions of the problem. The problem here is to prove that the error term is bounded by x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) given that 0 ≤x ≤1. The key given conditions here are the interval and the function's expansion. \n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- arctan x is expressed as the given Taylor series sum plus E_{2n}(x),\n- The interval is 0 ≤x ≤1,\n- The (2n+1)th derivative of arctan x satisfies certain bounds.\n\nBut the user mentions that to apply the theorem, they need to bound the (n+1)th derivative, but in this problem, since the error term is E_{2n}(x), that corresponds to the (2n+1)th derivative. Therefore, the assumption related to the derivative bound is part of applying the theorem, but it's not given—it's what needs to be established. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove the bound on the error term. The user is struggling to bound the derivatives. The theorem requires that the (n+1)th derivative is bounded. Here, the error term is E_{2n}(x), which would use the (2n+1)th derivative. So the key assumption would be that this derivative can be bounded appropriately on [0,1]. However, the problem statement doesn't state this as a given, but rather the user needs to find this bound. Therefore, the problem is to show that given the function arctan x and its Taylor expansion up to 2n terms, the error term is bounded by x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) when 0 ≤x ≤1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed: the function is arctan x, the expansion is up to degree 2n-1 (sum from k=0 to n-1 gives terms up to x^{2n-1}), the interval is 0 ≤x ≤1, and perhaps the center of expansion is a=0.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function is arctan x,\n- The Taylor expansion of arctan x is centered at 0,\n- The expansion is up to the term of degree 2n-1,\n- The interval considered is 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that |E_{2n}(x)| ≤ x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nWait, but the example given had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the original problem's assumptions include that x is between 0 and 1. So each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- arctan x is expanded in its Taylor series about a = 0,\n- The Taylor polynomial is of degree 2n -1 (since the sum goes up to k = n-1, which gives x^{2k+1} up to 2(n-1)+1 = 2n -1),\n- The error term E_{2n}(x) is the remainder after the Taylor polynomial,\n- The value of x satisfies 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were separate: n is integer, n divisible by 7. So here, each line is a separate condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function considered is arctan x,\n- The Taylor expansion is centered at a = 0,\n- The expansion includes terms up to k = n-1, resulting in a polynomial of degree 2n -1,\n- The error term E_{2n}(x) corresponds to the remainder of the Taylor expansion,\n- The interval of x is 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nBut perhaps even more atomic. Each assumption line should address one property or condition of one object. For example:\n\n- arctan x is expanded as a Taylor series around a = 0,\n- The Taylor series expansion of arctan x is truncated at the term of degree 2n -1,\n- The error term E_{2n}(x) is the remainder of the Taylor series expansion,\n- The variable x is in the interval [0, 1].\n\nWait, but the truncation at degree 2n -1 is part of the problem statement. The original problem says \"arctan x = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [term] + E_{2n}(x)\". Each term in the sum is x^{2k+1}/(2k+1), so the highest degree term is when k = n-1, which is x^{2(n-1)+1} = x^{2n -1}. Therefore, the polynomial is up to degree 2n -1, so the remainder term E_{2n}(x) is for the Taylor polynomial of degree 2n -1. Therefore, in the Taylor theorem, the remainder term after degree m is E_m(x), which involves the (m+1)th derivative. So here, since the polynomial is degree 2n -1, the remainder E_{2n}(x) would involve the (2n)th derivative? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, in Taylor's theorem, the remainder term E_n(x) after the degree n polynomial is given by the (n+1)th derivative. For example, P_n(x) is the Taylor polynomial up to x^n, then E_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! x^{n+1} (for Maclaurin). So in this problem, the polynomial is up to degree 2n -1, so that would correspond to P_{2n -1}(x), so the remainder term would be E_{2n -1}(x). However, in the problem statement, it's written as E_{2n}(x). So maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, let's check again:\n\nThe problem states:\narctan x = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [(-1)^k x^{2k+1}/(2k+1)] + E_{2n}(x)\n\nThe sum from k=0 to n-1 of x^{2k+1}/(2k+1) would be the terms x, x^3/3, x^5/5, ..., x^{2n -1}/(2n -1). So that's a polynomial of degree 2n -1. Therefore, the remainder term E_{2n}(x) is the error after approximating with a degree 2n -1 polynomial. However, in standard Taylor series notation, the remainder after the degree m polynomial is E_m(x). So here, m = 2n -1, so the remainder should be E_{2n -1}(x). But the problem uses E_{2n}(x). Maybe it's a different notation. Alternatively, perhaps the remainder term is for the expansion up to the term involving x^{2n}, but since the odd function only has odd powers, so the expansion up to x^{2n -1} would be followed by the next term x^{2n +1}, hence the remainder might be associated with E_{2n}(x). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the notation where E_{2n}(x) corresponds to the error term when considering the expansion up to n terms, but each term is of degree 2k+1. So, after n terms (from k=0 to n-1), the highest degree is 2n -1, but the error term is labeled as E_{2n}(x). Maybe it's a notation choice. Regardless, the key point is that the error term is related to the next term in the series, which would involve x^{2n +1}, as per the bound x^{2n +1}/(2n +1). So, the remainder term is of order x^{2n +1}, which is the next term. Therefore, in the Taylor series remainder formula, this would correspond to the (2n +1)th derivative. Therefore, the remainder term E_{2n}(x) is related to the (2n +1)th derivative. \n\nTherefore, to apply the theorem from Apostol, which requires bounding the (n+1)th derivative for the error term E_n(x), here we need to bound the (2n +1)th derivative for the error term E_{2n}(x). Hence, the key assumption here is the interval 0 ≤x ≤1, and the function's derivatives being bounded there. \n\nBut since the problem is to prove the bound on E_{2n}(x), the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem statement. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- arctan x is expressed as the given Taylor series sum up to k =n-1 plus E_{2n}(x),\n- The interval is 0 ≤x ≤1.\n\nBut each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- arctan x is expanded in a Taylor series about a =0,\n- The Taylor series is truncated after the term of degree 2n-1,\n- The error term E_{2n}(x) is defined as the remainder of the expansion,\n- The variable x is in the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that |E_{2n}(x)| ≤ x^{2n+1}/(2n +1) for all x in [0,1].\n\nThat should cover the necessary assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Similarly here, each bullet point is a separate condition. So the expansion being around a=0 is an assumption, truncating at 2n-1 is another, defining the error term, and x being between 0 and 1. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \narctan x is expanded in a Taylor series about a = 0,\nThe Taylor series of arctan x is truncated after the term of degree $2n-1$,\nThe error term $E_{2n}(x)$ is the remainder of the Taylor series expansion,\nThe variable $x$ satisfies $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$|E_{2n}(x)| \\leq \\dfrac{x^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\text{ in } [0, 1].$$",
