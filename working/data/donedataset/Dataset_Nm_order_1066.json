    "Content": "So I'm a bit stuck on the following problem I'm attempting to solve. Essentially, I'm required to prove that $\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n^2} < 1$ for all $n$. I've been toiling with some algebraic gymnastics for a while now, but I can't seem to get the proof right. Proving it using calculus isn't a problem, but I'm struggling hither.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As often happens with induction proofs, the easiest approach to proving this statement (which doesn't seem inducable at all - after all, how does knowing the sum for $n$ is less than $1$ tell you anything about the sum for $n+1$?) via induction is to transform it into a stronger one:\n$$\\mathrm{For\\ all\\ } n\\geq2, \\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{n^2} \\lt 1-\\frac{1}{n}.$$ Now, the answer becomes a matter of simple algebra: $$\\sum_{i=2}^{n+1} \\frac{1}{i^2} = \\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\frac{1}{i^2} +\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\\lt 1-\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\\lt 1-\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = 1-\\frac{1}{n+1}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the sum of 1/(k²) from k=2 to n is less than 1 for all n. First, I need to structure the problem according to the specified format.\n\nOriginal problem mentions induction in the title. The user is trying to prove the inequality using induction but is stuck. They also mention that using calculus isn't a problem, but the algebraic approach is tricky. The problem statement is to show that the sum from k=2 to n of 1/k² is less than 1 for all n.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction had assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about proving an inequality for all n (presumably integers greater than or equal to 2, since the sum starts at 2). So the assumptions here would be that n is an integer and n ≥ 2. Because the sum starts at 2, n can't be less than 2. The problem is to prove that the sum is less than 1. \n\nBut wait, does the problem specify that n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2? The original question says \"for all n\", but in the title it's \"sum from 2 to n\". So n must be at least 2. Therefore, the assumptions are that n is an integer and n ≥ 2. \n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the sum of 1/k² from k=2 to n is less than 1. \n\nSo following the format:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=2}^n \\frac{1}{k^2} < 1$$ for all n.\n\nWait, but the original title says \"A (probably trivial) induction problem: sum_2^nk^{-2}<1\". So the user is attempting induction. The example given in the initial instruction had assumptions listed as properties of the variables. Here, n is an integer and n ≥ 2. That's two separate assumptions. \n\nSo I need to structure the problem with these assumptions. The user might have missed stating that n is an integer, but in the context of induction, n is typically an integer. But it's better to list both conditions explicitly.",
