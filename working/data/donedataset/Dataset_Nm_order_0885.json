    "Content": "My question is too simple. We know all that if we define the exponential function on $\\mathbb{C}$ then we define the real part and imaginary part of $\\exp{it}$ as $\\cos{t}$ and $\\sin{t}$. So if we assume that we know the definition of the trigonometric functions and the exponential function not as a series but for exponential as solution of differential equation $y'-y=0$ then my question is How can I explain this relation (intrinsically)in a simple way to a high-school student, they is any physical interpretation of this formula  ? or we  can give another equivalent question (in my sens) How can one prove the Euler relation? and What was the original proof of Euler himself?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have two favorite arguments that we should have $\\exp (i\\theta)=\\cos \\theta +i\\sin \\theta$ for real $\\theta$ . The first is closely related to Mathologer's video e to the pi i for dummies , and the second is discussed in slightly more detail in II.2 “Moving Particle Argument” in Visual Complex Analysis . Finally, I conclude with a summary of how Euler did it, from How Euler Did It by Ed Sandifer for MAA Online. 1. Limit Argument Many high school students are aware that $e=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left(1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^n$ . For real $r$ , some may be acquainted with the fact that $e^r=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left(1+\\dfrac{r}{n}\\right)^n$ . We can declare by fiat that this will serve as a definition for all complex $r$ . Then we have $e^{i\\theta}=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left(1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n$ . Now we just need to use geometric properties of complex multiplication to argue that $e^{i\\theta}$ has magnitude $1$ and argument/angle $\\theta$ . Magnitude $1$ $\\left|e^{i\\theta}\\right|=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|^n=\\sqrt{\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left(1+\\dfrac{\\theta^2}{n^2}\\right)^{n}}$ . This is certainly no less than $1$ . However, since for $n>\\dfrac{\\theta^2}{r}$ we have $\\dfrac{r}{n}>\\dfrac{\\theta^2}{n^2}$ , it can be no more than $\\sqrt{e^r}$ for any positive $r$ , so the limit is $1$ (at least if it exists). Therefore, $e^{i\\theta}$ lies on the unit circle. Angle $\\theta$ When calculating $\\left(1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n$ for fixed $n$ geometrically, we can draw a right triangle with vertices at $0$ , $1$ , and $1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}$ . Then a triangle on the hypotenuse, with a new vertex at $(1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n})^2$ . Then a new triangle...\nThis yields something that looks like You can manipulate this spiral at a little geogebra applet I made . Assuming $\\theta>0$ , the $k^{\\text{th}}$ triangle has a leg away from the origin of length $\\dfrac{\\theta}{n}\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|^{k-1}$ . For $n$ large, the outer perimeter of this spiral is intuitively close to $\\theta$ since $\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|$ is very close to $1$ , so each factor like $\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|^{k-1}$ is fairly close to $1$ , so that it is as if we are adding $n$ terms of $\\dfrac{\\theta}{n}$ . Arguing that more formally may require calculus or clever algebra after the sum of the finite geometric series is calculated to be $\\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\theta}{n}\\left(\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|^{n}-1\\right)}{\\left|1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right|-1}$ . If $0\\le\\theta<2\\pi$ , then the perimeter approaching $\\theta$ gives you an arc length, and hence an angle, of $\\theta$ around the unit circle, as desired. If $\\theta>2\\pi$ , then if we hope or check that $e^{i\\theta}e^{i\\rho}=e^{i(\\theta+\\rho)}$ with our definition, then you can get the desired angle by adding/subtracting the relevant multiple of $2\\pi$ , we get the desired result. 2. Moving Particle Argument A student who's had most of a first year of Calculus may be able to appreciate this argument based on a vector function and derivatives. (For this moving particle argument, I'm largely just quoting another MSE answer of mine .) Consider a particle moving counterclockwise around the unit circle in the complex plane (starting at $1+0i$ ) at unit speed. By the definition of radians and sine and cosine, its position in the complex plane at time $t$ is given by $\\mathbf{s}\\left(t\\right)=\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta$ . Since a tangent to a circle forms a right angle and multiplication by $i$ rotates things counterclockwise by a right angle ( $x+iy$ is sent to $-y+ix$ ) we have $\\mathbf{s}'\\left(t\\right)=ki\\mathbf{s}\\left(t\\right)$ for some positive real number $k$ . Since it's going at unit speed, we have $\\left|\\mathbf{s}'\\left(t\\right)\\right|=1$ so that $k=1$ as $\\left|\\mathbf{s}\\left(t\\right)\\right|=\\sqrt{\\cos^{2}t+\\sin^{2}t}=1$ . Now we just need to find a complex function where $\\mathbf{s}\\left(0\\right)=1$ and $\\mathbf{s}'\\left(t\\right)=i\\mathbf{s}\\left(t\\right)$ . The exponential function is its own derivative for real inputs, and we can declare by fiat that it should still work for complex inputs. Then the chain rule for differentiation tells us we can use $\\mathbf{s}\\left(t\\right)=e^{it}$ . 3. How Euler Did It This is just a paraphrasing of some of How Euler Did It by Ed Sandifer - in particular, the parts where he paraphrases from Euler's Introductio . Note that Euler's work was in Latin, used different variables, and did not have modern concepts of infinity. I'll use $\\mathrm{cis}\\theta$ to denote $\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta$ . Euler derived (possibly based on DeMoivre's work) that $(\\mathrm{cis}z)^n=\\mathrm{cis}(nz)$ for (positive?) integer $n$ . Then he  derives $$\\cos(nz)=\\dfrac{(\\mathrm{cis}(z))^n+(\\mathrm{cis}(-z))^n}{2}\\text{ and }\\sin(nz)=\\dfrac{(\\mathrm{cis}(z))^n-(\\mathrm{cis}(-z))^n}{2i}\\text{.}$$ Then he uses the Maclaurin series expansions for $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ to turn these into something along the lines of $$\\cos(\\theta)=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\dfrac{\\left(1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n+\\left(1-\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n}{2}\\text{ and }\\sin(\\theta)=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\dfrac{\\left(1+\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n-\\left(1-\\dfrac{i\\theta}{n}\\right)^n}{2i}\\text{.}$$ Then he used the \" $e^r=\\displaystyle{\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}}\\left(1+\\dfrac{r}{n}\\right)^n$ \" idea to turn these into $$\\cos(\\theta)=\\dfrac{e^{i\\theta}+e^{-i\\theta}}{2}\\text{ and }\\sin(\\theta)=\\dfrac{e^{i\\theta}-e^{-i\\theta}}{2i}\\text{.}$$ Then it's just a bit of algebra to get to $e^{i\\theta}=\\mathrm{cis}\\theta$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They want me to act as a bilingual mathematics professor and format a given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The structure requires listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed two assumptions: that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was simplified to remove redundant information, focusing on the core problem.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is about proving Euler's identity, exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. The original question mentions defining the exponential function on the complex numbers with real and imaginary parts as cosine and sine, using the differential equation definition (y' - y = 0) instead of power series. The user asks for a simple explanation suitable for high-school students, possibly with a physical interpretation, and inquires about Euler's original proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The user mentions that the exponential function is defined on the complex numbers. The real part is cosine and the imaginary part is sine. Also, the exponential is defined as the solution to the differential equation y' - y = 0. Additionally, the target audience is high-school students, so the explanation should avoid advanced mathematics like power series. The problem is to explain or prove Euler's formula in a simple, intrinsic way, possibly with physical interpretation, and to inquire about Euler's original proof.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should each be a single condition or property applied to one object. \n\nPossible assumptions:\n- The exponential function is defined on the complex numbers.\n- The exponential function is the solution to the differential equation y' = y.\n- The real part of exp(iθ) is cosθ.\n- The imaginary part of exp(iθ) is sinθ.\n- Trigonometric functions are defined geometrically (since the user wants to avoid series and use differential equations).\n\nWait, the problem states that the exponential is defined via the differential equation y' = y, not as a series. The trigonometric functions are presumably defined in their standard way, maybe geometrically or through differential equations. The user wants to connect these definitions to derive Euler's formula.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. The exponential function for complex numbers is defined as the solution to the differential equation y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n2. The cosine function is defined as the real part of exp(iθ).\n3. The sine function is defined as the imaginary part of exp(iθ).\nBut wait, the original question says \"we define the real part and imaginary part of exp(it) as cos t and sin t\". So actually, the assumption is that exp(it) has real part cos t and imaginary part sin t. But the problem is to explain this relation intrinsically, so perhaps the definitions are given via differential equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the exponential is defined via the differential equation, and cosine and sine are defined in another way (like solutions to y'' + y = 0), and the task is to show that exp(iθ) equals cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nWait, the original question says: \"if we define the exponential function on ℂ then we define the real part and imaginary part of exp(it) as cos t and sin t\". So the user is stating that in their current approach, the real and imaginary parts are defined as cosine and sine. However, they want to explain this relationship in a simple way without using power series, perhaps starting from the differential equation definition of the exponential. So the problem is to show that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ using the differential equation definition of exp and possibly other definitions of sine and cosine.\n\nBut the user is asking how to prove Euler's formula given that the exponential is defined as the solution to y' = y. So the assumptions would be:\n- The exponential function is the solution to the differential equation y' = y with initial condition y(0) = 1.\n- The trigonometric functions cosθ and sinθ are defined geometrically or as solutions to y'' + y = 0 with certain initial conditions.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user mentions that they define the real and imaginary parts of exp(it) as cos t and sin t. So maybe the assumption is that the exponential function is extended to complex numbers, and its real and imaginary parts are defined as cosine and sine. But then the problem is to explain why this definition leads to Euler's identity. However, that seems a bit circular. Alternatively, the problem could be to show that defining exp(z) via the differential equation leads to Euler's formula when z is purely imaginary.\n\nI need to parse the original question again. The user says: \"if we define the exponential function on ℂ then we define the real part and imaginary part of exp(it) as cos t and sin t\". So they are taking the definition of exp(it) as having real part cos t and imaginary part sin t. Then they want to explain this relationship in a simple way using the differential equation definition of the exponential (not as a series). So the problem is: given that exp(z) is defined as the solution to y' = y, and when z = it, then the real part is cos t and imaginary part is sin t, how can we explain this intrinsically?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is assuming that exp(z) is defined for complex z via the differential equation, and they want to show that exp(it) equals cos t + i sin t, where cos and sin are defined separately (perhaps via their own differential equations).\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The exponential function on complex numbers is defined as the solution to the differential equation y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n2. The functions cosθ and sinθ are defined as the real and imaginary parts of exp(iθ), respectively.\nWait, but the user says \"we define the real part and imaginary part of exp(it) as cos t and sin t\". So that would mean that by definition, exp(it) = cos t + i sin t. But that's exactly Euler's formula. So the problem is perhaps to justify why this definition is equivalent to the differential equation definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is confused because they are defining exp(z) via the differential equation, and separately defining cos and sin, and wants to show that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So the problem is to prove Euler's formula starting from the differential equation definition of exp and some definition of sine and cosine.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponential function is the unique solution to y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n- The functions cosine and sine are defined as the solutions to y'' + y = 0 with initial conditions cos(0) = 1, cos'(0) = 0, sin(0) = 0, sin'(0) = 1.\n- The exponential function can be extended to complex arguments.\n\nProblem: Prove that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user says they define the real and imaginary parts of exp(it) as cos t and sin t. So maybe the problem is to show that this definition is consistent with the differential equation definition. But then it's a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that if we define exp(z) via the differential equation, then when restricted to imaginary arguments, it must satisfy exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ, where cos and sin are defined via their differential equations.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nThe user's main points in the question are:\n\n1. They know that exp(it) has real part cos t and imaginary part sin t.\n2. The exponential is defined via the differential equation y' = y, not as a series.\n3. They want to explain Euler's identity in a simple way to high-school students, possibly with a physical interpretation.\n4. They also ask about Euler's original proof.\n\nBut according to the formatting example, the assumptions should be conditions or properties applied to one object each.\n\nGiven that, the relevant assumptions for the problem (to structure it) would be those that are given in the problem setup. The user is defining exp via the differential equation and wants to show that exp(iθ) equals cosθ + i sinθ, where cos and sin are defined as the real and imaginary parts. Wait, but that's circular. Alternatively, if cos and sin are defined via another method (like differential equations), then the problem is to show the equality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The exponential function for complex numbers is defined as the solution to y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n- The functions cosine and sine are defined as the real and imaginary parts of exp(iθ).\n\nBut then the problem would be to prove that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ, which is trivial by definition. So perhaps the user has a different definition of cosine and sine in mind.\n\nAlternatively, if cosine and sine are defined via their own differential equations, then the problem is to show that exp(iθ) satisfies those and hence equals cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nIn that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponential function exp(z) is the solution to y' = y with y(0) = 1 for complex z.\n- The cosine function is the solution to y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.\n- The sine function is the solution to y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions defining the real and imaginary parts of exp(it) as cos t and sin t. So maybe the problem is not to prove the equality but to explain why this definition is valid or equivalent to the differential equation approach.\n\nHowever, the user's question is a bit confusing. They might be conflating definitions with properties to prove. To format the problem correctly, I need to identify the assumptions given in the problem statement and then state the problem.\n\nThe original question says: \"we define the real part and imaginary part of exp(it) as cos t and sin t\". So the assumption here is that exp(it) is defined to have real part cos t and imaginary part sin t. But then the problem is to explain this relation intrinsically, which seems odd because it's by definition. Perhaps the user intended to define exp via the differential equation and then show that its real and imaginary parts are cos and sin, which are defined separately.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponential function on complex numbers is defined as the solution to y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n- The cosine function is the real part of exp(iθ).\n- The sine function is the imaginary part of exp(iθ).\n\nBut again, that makes Euler's formula a definition rather than something to prove. The user's confusion might stem from mixing different definitions. Therefore, perhaps the intended assumptions are:\n\n- The exponential function for complex numbers is defined via the differential equation y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n- The functions cosθ and sinθ are defined geometrically (as circular functions).\n- The problem is to show that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nAlternatively, if the trigonometric functions are defined via their power series or differential equations, then the proof can proceed by showing that both sides satisfy the same differential equation.\n\nGiven the user's mention of using the differential equation definition for exp and not series, perhaps the correct approach is to use the differential equations of exp, cos, and sin to prove the identity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponential function exp(z) satisfies y' = y with y(0) = 1 for complex z.\n- The cosine function satisfies y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.\n- The sine function satisfies y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1.\n- The exponential function can be extended to complex arguments.\n\nProblem: Prove that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nBut in the original question, the user seems to have defined the real and imaginary parts as cos and sin. So maybe the problem is to show that this definition aligns with the differential equation definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to derive Euler's formula using the differential equation definition of exp(z), given that cos and sin are defined via their differential equations.\n\nIn any case, the formatted problem should list the assumptions line by line and then state the problem.\n\nGiven the example provided, the assumptions should be specific and each address one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo, possible assumptions for this problem:\n\n1. The exponential function exp(z) is defined as the solution to the differential equation y' = y with y(0) = 1 for complex z.\n2. The cosine function is defined as the unique solution to y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0.\n3. The sine function is defined as the unique solution to y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1.\n4. The imaginary unit i satisfies i² = -1.\n\nProblem: Prove that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nThis seems to cover the necessary components. Each assumption addresses a single property or condition of one object (exp, cos, sin, i). The problem is then to prove Euler's identity under these assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is taking cos and sin as the real and imaginary parts of exp(iθ), then the problem would be to show that these satisfy the trigonometric identities or differential equations. But based on the original question, the user wants to explain why exp(iθ) has real part cosθ and imaginary part sinθ, given that exp is defined via the differential equation.\n\nSo perhaps another way:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The exponential function exp(z) for complex z is defined as the solution to y' = y with y(0) = 1.\n- The real part of exp(iθ) is denoted as cosθ.\n- The imaginary part of exp(iθ) is denoted as sinθ.\n\nProblem: Show that the functions cosθ and sinθ defined in this way satisfy the standard trigonometric identities, or equivalently, that this definition aligns with their differential equation definitions.\n\nBut the original question is about proving Euler's identity, so the problem is to show that exp(iθ) equals cosθ + i sinθ under the given definitions.\n\nGiven all this, the formatted problem should list assumptions related to the definitions of exp, cos, and sin via differential equations, and then state the problem as proving Euler's formula.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe exponential function exp(z) is the solution to the differential equation y' = y with y(0) = 1 for complex z,\nThe cosine function is the solution to the differential equation y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0,\nThe sine function is the solution to the differential equation y'' + y = 0 with y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1,\nThe imaginary unit i satisfies i² = -1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that exp(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.\n\nEach assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property of each object (exp, cos, sin, i). The problem is to prove Euler's identity under these assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, if the user defines exp(iθ) as having real and imaginary parts cosθ and sinθ, the problem would be to show that this definition is consistent with the differential equation. But that might be redundant. Hence, the more challenging and meaningful problem is to start from the differential equation definitions and prove the identity.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should follow this structure.",
