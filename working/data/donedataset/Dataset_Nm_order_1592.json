    "Content": "I've been looking for perfect squares that can be represented as $\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}p^k$. Of course, both $n$ and $p$ should be natural numbers larger than $1$. Searching up to $n=100$ and $p=200$, I found only $2$ cases: $121=11^2=3^0+3^1+3^2+3^3+3^4=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{4}3^k$ $400=20^2=7^0+7^1+7^2+7^3=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{3}7^k$ Is there any way to prove that there are no other cases?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Turning a comment into an answer (of sorts).... Various papers (e.g., this one by Yann Bugeaud and Preda Mihailescu) cite papers by Nagell and Ljunggren as proving there are no perfect squares of the given form other than the ones the OP found. As for the more general problem of representing an arbitrary perfect power, a recent paper by Michael Bennett and Aaron Levin offers this assessment in its abstract (boldface emphasis added): The Diophantine equation ${x^n−1\\over x-1} = y^q$ has four known\n  solutions in integers $x$, $y$, $q$ and $n$ with $|x|, |y|, q \\gt 1$\n  and $n \\gt 2$. Whilst we expect that there are, in fact, no more\n  solutions, such a result is well beyond current technology. The other two solutions referred to are the perfect cube $7^3$ expressed as $1+18+18^2$ and $1+(-19)+(-19)^2$. See also the MathOverflow answer by quid.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the user is asking if 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares that can be written as the sum of powers of a prime number p from k=0 to n. They checked up to n=100 and p=200 and only found those two cases. Now they want to know if there's a proof that no other such squares exist.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question mentions that both n and p are natural numbers larger than 1. So I should list those assumptions. Also, the sum is from k=0 to n of p^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is (p^{n+1} - 1)/(p - 1). So maybe that's a key formula here.\n\nThe problem is to determine if 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of this form. So the assumptions would include:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sum is a perfect square.\n\nWait, the user says \"perfect squares of the form sum_{k=0}^n p^k\". So the sum must equal some square, say m^2. The question is whether there are any other such squares besides 121 and 400.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sum S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares of the form S?\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\", so the problem is to confirm if these are the only ones or if there are others. So in the formatted problem, it should be phrased as a question asking whether they are the only ones. However, in the example given, the problem is phrased as \"Prove that...\". But here, the user is asking if there's a proof that there are no other cases. So maybe the problem statement is to prove that 121 and 400 are the only solutions.\n\nBut the example given in the format starts with \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the problem here would be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of the form...\", but the original question is phrased as \"Are 121 and 400 the only...\". Hmm. Maybe the problem should be stated as the original question, but in the example, the user converted it into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps here, since the original question is \"Are 121 and 400 the only...\", the problem statement should remain as that question. Alternatively, maybe rephrase it to \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\" if that's what the user wants. But the example shows that assumptions are extracted from the problem, even if the problem isn't phrased as a \"Prove that...\".\n\nWait, the original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\". But in the formatted problem, the assumption lists n as an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then n being divisible by 7 would be a specific case, not the general one. Maybe that example had a mistake. But regardless, the user wants the current problem structured with assumptions and problem statement.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions are that p and n are natural numbers greater than 1, and the sum is a perfect square. The problem is whether 121 and 400 are the only such squares.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption includes specific conditions. Let me check again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like maybe the problem was misrepresented. But perhaps in that example, the original problem actually had a condition that n is divisible by 7, which might have been part of the problem's hidden assumptions. Maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user states that they are looking for perfect squares of the form sum_{k=0}^n p^k where n and p are natural numbers larger than 1. So the assumptions should be:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sum S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k is a perfect square.\n\nBut the problem is asking if 121 and 400 are the only such squares. So the problem statement would be: \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares of the form S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k where p and n are natural numbers greater than 1?\"\n\nAlternatively, if phrased as a proof request: \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of the form...\"\n\nBut since the original question is phrased as a yes/no question, maybe the problem should be stated as such. However, in the example, the problem was converted into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Perhaps the user wants the problem to be phrased as a directive, like \"Prove that there are no other perfect squares...\" or \"Determine whether 121 and 400 are the only...\". Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example had the original problem as \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the current problem should be structured with the problem statement as \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\", unless there's an implicit \"prove\" in the original question. The user is asking \"Is there any way to prove that there are no other cases?\" So the actual problem is to determine if those are the only cases, which would require proof. Therefore, maybe the problem statement should be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\", but since the user is asking if they can be proven to be the only ones, perhaps the problem is to \"Determine whether 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\".\n\nBut given the example, I think the problem statement should be phrased as a directive. Let me check the user's example again. The original problem was \"Prove that...\", and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a question asking if they are the only ones, and if there's a way to prove it. So perhaps the problem should be stated as \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\", but the example's problem statement was a \"Prove that...\", so maybe the assistant should structure it as a statement to prove. However, since the original problem is phrased as a question, perhaps the problem should remain as the question.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format.\" The example given by the user has the problem statement as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps even if the original is a question, we should rephrase it into a \"Prove that...\" if that's what the user wants. Alternatively, follow the original's phrasing. The example might have been a case where the original problem was already a \"Prove that...\", so they kept it. Here, the original is a question, so maybe the problem statement should be \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\".\n\nBut the user's example also included additional assumptions. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 13*7. Maybe the problem actually had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user included that in the assumptions. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, but regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user specifies that n and p are natural numbers larger than 1. So those are the assumptions. Then the problem is to determine if 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of that form. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sum S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares of the form S?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement should be the main question, and assumptions are the conditions given. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". This suggests that maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user wants all conditions listed as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nIn this case, the problem states that n and p are natural numbers larger than 1, so those are the assumptions. Then the sum is a perfect square. The problem is whether only 121 and 400 satisfy this.\n\nAlternatively, the sum being a perfect square is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to find when the sum is a perfect square, so the sum being a perfect square is the conclusion, not an assumption. Hmm, but in the example, the conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91, which was the problem to prove, and the assumptions were the conditions on n.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions are the given conditions: p and n are natural numbers >1. The problem is whether the sum is a perfect square only in the cases of 121 and 400.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that those are the only cases. So the problem statement should be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of the form sum_{k=0}^n p^k where p and n are natural numbers greater than 1.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the original question is asking \"Are they the only ones?\", then the problem is to answer that question, which would involve proving that no others exist. So the problem statement would be: \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares of the form sum_{k=0}^n p^k with p and n natural numbers greater than 1?\"\n\nBut given the example, where the original problem was converted into a \"Prove that...\" statement, maybe here we should structure the problem as \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\".\n\nBut the original question is phrased as a yes/no question. However, since the user wants the problem structured in the format similar to the example, which uses \"Prove that...\", perhaps we should rephrase the problem as a statement to prove. Therefore, the problem would be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\".\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the formatted problem kept it as \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a question: \"Are 121 and 400 the only...\". So perhaps the formatted problem should keep it as a question. However, the example's problem statement was a directive, so maybe the assistant should adjust accordingly. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think following the original phrasing is better unless instructed otherwise. Since the user provided an example where the problem was restructured from \"Prove that...\" to \"Prove that...\", perhaps in this case, the problem should be restructured as a statement to prove, i.e., \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\".\n\nBut the user's original question ends with \"Is there any way to prove that there are no other cases?\" So the problem is to prove that there are no other cases, i.e., that 121 and 400 are the only solutions. Therefore, the problem statement should be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares...\".\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n- The sum S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k is a perfect square.\n\nProblem: Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of the form S.\n\nBut wait, the sum being a perfect square is the conclusion, not an assumption. Wait, no. The problem is to find all instances where S is a perfect square, given that p and n are >1. So the assumptions are p and n are natural numbers >1, and the problem is to prove that S is a perfect square only when those two cases occur. Therefore, the sum being a perfect square is part of the problem's conclusion, not an assumption. So the assumptions should only include the given conditions, which are p and n being natural numbers >1.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions included both the domain of n (integer) and an additional condition (n divisible by 7). However, in the original problem of the example, the question was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which restricts it. This suggests that maybe the example has an error, but perhaps it's intentional. Maybe the user intended to extract all assumptions, including implicit ones. But in that case, if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then n being an integer is part of the problem's premise, not an assumption to list. However, the example lists it as an assumption, which seems redundant.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem statement, which are that p and n are natural numbers greater than 1. The sum being a perfect square is what we're trying to establish in specific cases, so it's not an assumption. Therefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- p is a natural number greater than 1.\n- n is a natural number greater than 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k is a perfect square only when S equals 121 or 400.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\", but following the example's structure, it should be a directive like \"Prove that...\".\n\nBut let's check the example again. The original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted problem was:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem's statement was \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. However, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. This suggests that perhaps in the example, there was a mistake, or maybe the original problem had a typo. Regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user specifies that n and p are natural numbers greater than 1. Those are the given conditions, so they should be the assumptions. The problem is to determine if the sum S is a perfect square only in the cases of 121 and 400. Therefore, the problem statement should be \"Prove that 121 and 400 are the only perfect squares of the form S = sum_{k=0}^n p^k where p and n are natural numbers greater than 1.\"\n\nAlternatively, if following the example's structure where the problem is to prove a property given certain assumptions, perhaps the assumptions are p and n >1, and the problem is to prove that S is a perfect square only in those two cases.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\np is a natural number greater than 1,\nn is a natural number greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum $\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}p^k$ is a perfect square only when the sum equals 121 or 400.\n\nAlternatively, to match the original question's phrasing, it could be \"Are 121 and 400 the only perfect squares...\", but the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the problem statement should be a directive.\n\nSo final structured problem:\n\nAssumption:\np is a natural number greater than 1,\nn is a natural number greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n}p^k$ is a perfect square only when the sum equals 121 or 400.",
