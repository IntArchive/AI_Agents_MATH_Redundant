    "AcceptedAnswer": "Problems like this appear frequently here. There are a couple of standard approaches. One is to use Fermat's little theorem , which says that if $p$ is a prime number, then $n^p-n$ is divisible by $p$ for all $n$. Since $42=2\\times 3\\times 7$, what we need to do is to check that 2, 3, and 7 divide $n^7-n$, no matter what $n$ is. That 7 does is direct from Fermat's little theorem. The theorem also ensures that 3 divides $n^3-n$. Now: $$n^7-n=n(n^6-1)=n((n^2)^3-1)=n(n^2-1)(n^4+n^2+1)=(n^3-n)(n^4+n^2+1),$$ so 3 indeed divides $n^7-n$. Finally, $n$ and $n^7$ always have the same parity, so $n^7-n$ is even. We can actually argue without Fermat's little theorem in this case. An approach that only requires patience is as follows: The idea is to factor the polynomial $x^7-x$ and then analyze the result when $x=n$ is an integer. (This is a trick that Bill Dubuque suggests sometimes in his solutions.) We have: $x^7-x=x(x^6-1)=x(x^3+1)(x^3-1)=x(x+1)(x^2-x+1)(x-1)(x^2+x+1)$. When $x=n$, we have\n$$ n^7-n=(n-1)n(n+1)(n^2-n+1)(n^2+n+1). $$\nNow we analyze this prime by prime, as before. Note that one of $n$ and $n-1$ is always even, so the product is even. Also, of 3 consecutive numbers, such as $n-1,n,n+1$, one is always divisible by 3, so it only remains to verify divisibility by 7. We may assume that $n=7k+b$ where $b=\\pm2$ or $\\pm3$, since otherwise $(n-1)n(n+1)$ is a multiple of 7. In that case, $n^2\\equiv 4$ or $2\\pmod 7$, and one of $n^2+n$, $n^2-n$ is $\\equiv 6\\pmod 7$, so $(n^2-n+1)(n^2+n+1)$ is a multiple of 7. The disadvantage of this approach over the previous one, of course, is the need to analyze different cases. Fermat's little theorem allows us to analyze all cases simultaneously, which typically (as here) results in a much faster approach. If you are comfortable with the method of induction, this gives us a way of verifying divisibility by 7 which is not without some elegance (divisibility by 2 and 3 is probably best approached as before). Note that $(-n)^7-(-n)=-(n^7-n)$, so we may as well assume that $n\\ge 0$. If $n=0$ it is obvious that 7 divides $n^7-n$. Suppose then that $7|n^7-n$, and argue that $7|(n+1)^7-(n+1)$. For this, actually expand $(n+1)^7$ using the binomial theorem: $$ (n+1)^7=n^7+7n^6+{7\\choose 2}n^5+{7\\choose 3}n^4+\\dots+1.$$ The point is that $${7\\choose k}=\\frac{7!}{k!(7-k)!}$$ is obviously divisible by 7 as long as $k\\ne0,7$, so (modulo 7) we have that $(n+1)^7-(n+1)\\equiv (n^7+1)-(n+1)=(n^7-n)$. Now we invoke the induction hypothesis, that precisely says that the latter is divisible by 7, and we are done. Of course, exactly the same inductive argument gives us a proof of Fermat's little theorem: $p|n^p-n$ for any $p$ prime and any integer $n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that n^7 - n is divisible by 42 for any integer n. Hmm, 42 is 6 times 7, and both 6 and 7 are factors here. Maybe I should check divisibility by 6 and 7 separately first, since if a number is divisible by both, then it's divisible by their least common multiple, which is 42.\n\nStarting with divisibility by 6: 6 is 2 times 3. So I need to show that n^7 - n is divisible by 2 and by 3. Let's check modulo 2 first. For any integer n, if n is even, then n^7 is even, so n^7 - n is even minus even, which is even. If n is odd, n^7 is odd, so odd minus odd is even. So modulo 2, n^7 - n is congruent to 0. That works.\n\nNow modulo 3. Using Fermat's little theorem, which says that if p is prime, then n^p ≡ n mod p. Here p=3, so n^3 ≡ n mod 3. Then n^7 = n^(3*2 +1) = (n^3)^2 * n ≡ n^2 * n = n^3 ≡ n mod 3. Therefore, n^7 - n ≡ n - n = 0 mod 3. So divisible by 3. Hence, divisible by 6.\n\nNow for 7. Again using Fermat's little theorem, since 7 is prime, n^7 ≡ n mod 7. Therefore, n^7 - n ≡ 0 mod 7. So divisible by 7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the number is divisible by 42. Therefore, the conclusion holds. But wait, the original problem didn't specify any restrictions on n, just any integer. So the assumptions would just be that n is an integer. The example given in the user's question had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but here there's no such condition. So the formatted problem should list the necessary assumptions. Wait, in this problem, the only assumption given is that n is an integer. So the assumptions section should just state that n is an integer. The problem is to prove divisibility by 42. So the user's example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but here the problem works for any integer n. So the formatted answer should have assumption: n is an integer. Then the problem is as stated. Wait, but maybe the user's example had a mistake? Let me check. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the original problem had n as an integer but the formatted one added an extra assumption. But in the current problem, the question is about proving n^7 - n is divisible by 42 for any integer n. So no additional assumptions beyond n being an integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption as n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 42.",
