    "Content": "I need to prove that: if a linear operator $\\phi : V \\rightarrow V$ on a vector space is nilpotent, then its only eigenvalue is $0$ . I know how to prove that this for a nilpotent matrix, but I'm not sure in the case of an operator. How would I be able to relate $\\phi$ to a matrix? Note: A nilpotent operator $\\phi$ has been defined as an operator that satisfies $\\phi^{n} = 0$ for some $n \\geq 1$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\phi$ is nilpotent, so $\\phi^n = 0$ for some $n$ .  Now let $v$ be an eigenvector: $\\phi v = \\lambda v$ for some scalar $\\lambda$ .  Now we get $$\n0 = \\phi^n v = \\lambda^n v ~\\Rightarrow~ \\lambda=0 ~.\n$$ Note that this works in the infinite-dimensional case as well; there is no need to relate $\\phi$ to a matrix. Edit : As suggested in the comments, we can also show that $0$ is always an eigenvalue; in other words, $\\phi$ always has at least one eigenvector.  Take any $v \\neq 0$ ; we know that $\\phi^n v = 0$ , so let $k$ be the largest integer such that $\\phi^k v \\neq 0$ .  Then $\\phi(\\phi^k v) = 0$ , so $\\phi^k v$ is an eigenvector of $\\phi$ , with eigenvalue $0$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure this math problem according to their specified format. Let me read through the original question again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving that the only eigenvalue of a nilpotent operator is 0. The user on Math Stack Exchange is asking how to do this for a linear operator, not just a matrix. They mentioned they know how to prove it for a nilpotent matrix but are unsure about the operator case. Also, they note that a nilpotent operator φ satisfies φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Let's parse the question step by step. The key elements here are:\n\n1. The operator φ is linear. The problem states \"a linear operator φ : V → V\", so that's one assumption.\n2. The operator is nilpotent, which is defined as φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1. So that's another assumption.\n3. The vector space V is the context here. The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on V, like being finite-dimensional, but since eigenvalues are being discussed, it's possible that V is over a field where eigenvalues make sense. However, the original problem doesn't mention the field, so maybe we don't need to include that unless it's necessary. But maybe in the assumptions, we should note that V is a vector space over some field. Wait, but the user didn't specify, so perhaps the problem is general. However, eigenvalues are typically considered in the context of vector spaces over algebraically closed fields, but the problem doesn't state that. Hmm, but maybe the problem is assuming the standard case. However, since the user is relating to matrices, which are finite-dimensional, perhaps we need to assume V is a finite-dimensional vector space? Wait, but the question is about operators in general. The definition of eigenvalues doesn't require finite-dimensional spaces, but the existence of eigenvalues might. However, the problem just says \"the only eigenvalue is 0\", so even if there are no eigenvalues, the statement would be vacuously true? Wait, but in infinite dimensions, there can be operators with no eigenvalues, but if the operator is nilpotent, then maybe 0 is the only possible eigenvalue. The problem doesn't specify whether V is finite-dimensional. But the original problem's note says \"A nilpotent operator φ has been defined as an operator that satisfies φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1\". So maybe the problem is in general, not necessarily finite-dimensional. However, eigenvalues are defined as scalars λ such that there exists a non-zero vector v with φ(v) = λv. So even in infinite-dimensional spaces, that definition holds. So in that case, the problem is about any vector space V, and a linear operator φ: V → V which is nilpotent. So assumptions would be:\n\n- φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n- φ is nilpotent, i.e., there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that φ^n = 0 (the zero operator).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, φ is a linear operator (first assumption), φ is nilpotent (second assumption), and perhaps V is a vector space (third assumption). Wait, but the vector space V is part of the definition of the operator. So maybe \"φ is a linear operator on a vector space V\" is one assumption, and \"φ is nilpotent\" is another. But maybe splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n- φ: V → V is a linear operator.\n- There exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that φ^n is the zero operator.\n- (Maybe) V is a vector space over a field.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify the field. The question is about eigenvalues, which depend on the field. For example, over the real numbers, an operator might not have eigenvalues, but over algebraically closed fields like complex numbers, every operator has eigenvalues. But the problem states \"the only eigenvalue is 0\", so even if there are no eigenvalues, the statement holds. However, if there exists an eigenvalue, it must be 0. The problem is to show that if there is an eigenvalue, it's 0. So maybe the field is arbitrary. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n- φ is nilpotent (i.e., φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"relate φ to a matrix\". But in the formatted problem, they just list assumptions and the problem. So in the example, they included assumptions like n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but maybe the user in that example was mistaken. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions are:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\", unless the user made a mistake. But maybe the example was a mistake. However, the user is providing that example to show the desired format. So perhaps in their example, they mistakenly added the \"n is divisible by 7\" assumption, but the actual problem doesn't require that. Maybe the user intended to include all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's universal quantifier. Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem as per the example. So the example lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So in the current problem, the user's question states that φ is a linear operator on V, which is a vector space, and φ is nilpotent (φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1). The problem is to prove that the only eigenvalue is 0.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n\n- φ is nilpotent (i.e., there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that φ^n is the zero operator).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\", and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption shouldn't restrict n. But maybe the example had a different original problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user wants us to follow the format where each assumption is one condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nProve that if a linear operator φ : V → V on a vector space is nilpotent, then its only eigenvalue is 0.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n1. φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n\n2. φ is nilpotent (there exists n ≥ 1 such that φ^n = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nBut do we need to list \"V is a vector space\" as a separate assumption? In the example, the assumptions were about n. Here, V is the domain and codomain of φ, so φ being a linear operator on V implies V is a vector space. So maybe \"φ is a linear operator on a vector space V\" is one assumption, and \"φ is nilpotent\" is another.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n\n- φ is nilpotent (i.e., there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that φ^n = 0).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nAlternatively, since \"nilpotent operator\" is defined in the note, maybe include that definition as an assumption.\n\nBut according to the user's note in the original question: \"Note: A nilpotent operator φ has been defined as an operator that satisfies φ^n = 0 for some n ≥ 1.\" So the definition is given. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we can include φ being nilpotent as an assumption, since it's given in the problem statement.\n\nSo yes, the two assumptions would be:\n\n1. φ is a linear operator on a vector space V.\n\n2. φ is nilpotent (i.e., φ^n = 0 for some integer n ≥ 1).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only eigenvalue of φ is 0.\n\nI think that's correct. The user might have included the definition of nilpotent operator as part of the assumptions. So the answer should follow that.",
