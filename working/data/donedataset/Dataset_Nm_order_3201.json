    "Content": "In celebration of Pi Day, I messed around with the following Ramanujan formula : $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2 n}{n}^3 \\frac{42 n+5}{2^{12 n+4}} = \\frac1{\\pi} $$ It turns out that, through some identities such as the following : $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2 n}{n}^3 x^n = \\frac{4 K\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\sqrt{1-64 x}\\right)\\right)^2}{\\pi ^2} $$ we can derive an analytical expression for the original sum.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove the relation:\n\n$$ 2 \\sqrt{7} E(m) K(m) - (2+\\sqrt{7}) K(m)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nwhere \\( K(m) \\) and \\( E(m) \\) are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, respectively, and \\( m = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{63}}{16} \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of these elliptic integrals. \\( K(m) \\) is the integral from 0 to \\( \\pi/2 \\) of \\( \\frac{d\\phi}{\\sqrt{1 - m \\sin^2 \\phi}} \\), and \\( E(m) \\) is the integral of \\( \\sqrt{1 - m \\sin^2 \\phi} d\\phi \\) over the same interval. The parameter \\( m \\) here is the modulus squared, often denoted as \\( k^2 \\) in some references.\n\nGiven that \\( m = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{63}}{16} \\), maybe this specific value of \\( m \\) has some special properties that simplify the integrals. Sometimes, particular values of \\( m \\) relate to singular values where the elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of gamma functions or other known constants. Since the result involves \\( \\pi \\), it's likely connected to such evaluations.\n\nLooking at the equation they need to prove: it's a combination of \\( E(m)K(m) \\) and \\( K(m)^2 \\) equaling \\( \\pi/2 \\). This suggests that there might be a Legendre relation involved. The standard Legendre relation connects \\( K(k) \\), \\( E(k) \\), \\( K'(k) \\), and \\( E'(k) \\), where \\( K'(k) = K(k') \\) with \\( k' = \\sqrt{1 - k^2} \\). The Legendre relation is:\n\n$$ E(k)K(k') + E(k')K(k) - K(k)K(k') = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nBut in the given problem, there's only one modulus \\( m \\), not the complementary modulus. However, maybe the specific \\( m \\) here is chosen such that \\( k' \\) relates to \\( k \\) in a way that allows simplification. Let me compute \\( k' = \\sqrt{1 - m} \\).\n\nGiven \\( m = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{63}}{16} \\), then \\( 1 - m = 1 - \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{63}}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + \\sqrt{63}}{16} = \\frac{8 + \\sqrt{63}}{16} \\). So \\( k' = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 + \\sqrt{63}}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8 + \\sqrt{63}}}{4} \\). Let's compute \\( \\sqrt{8 + \\sqrt{63}} \\).\n\nNotice that \\( 8 + \\sqrt{63} \\) can be expressed as \\( (\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{9})^2 \\), since \\( (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2\\sqrt{ab} \\). Let's check: if a=7 and b=9, then it's 7 + 9 + 2*sqrt(63) = 16 + 2*sqrt(63). That's too big. Wait, maybe a smaller combination. Let's see, perhaps \\( \\sqrt{8 + \\sqrt{63}} \\). Suppose it's \\( \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} \\). Then:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2\\sqrt{ab} = 8 + \\sqrt{63} \\). So we have:\n\na + b = 8\n\n2*sqrt(ab) = sqrt(63) => sqrt(ab) = sqrt(63)/2 => ab = 63/4\n\nSo solving:\n\na + b = 8\n\nab = 63/4\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x^2 -8x + 63/4 = 0. Multiply by 4: 4x^2 -32x +63=0. Using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [32 ± sqrt(1024 - 1008)] / 8 = [32 ± sqrt(16)] /8 = [32 ±4]/8 => 36/8=4.5 or 28/8=3.5. So a=4.5=9/2 and b=3.5=7/2. Therefore, sqrt(8 + sqrt(63))=sqrt(9/2) + sqrt(7/2)= (3 + sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). Therefore:\n\nk' = [ (3 + sqrt(7))/sqrt(2) ] /4 = (3 + sqrt(7))/(4*sqrt(2)).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. But maybe the modulus m is a singular value where K and E can be expressed in terms of gamma functions. Alternatively, perhaps there's a connection to the Chowla-Selberg formula, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem came from a Ramanujan formula related to 1/pi, and elliptic integrals, maybe the specific combination of E and K relates to a hypergeometric identity. Alternatively, perhaps using the differential equations satisfied by K and E.\n\nRecall that K(m) and E(m) satisfy the differential equations:\n\ndK/dm = (E(m) - (1 - m)K(m))/(2m(1 - m))\n\ndE/dm = (E(m) - K(m))/(2m)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful. Alternatively, maybe using the relation between E and K. For example, E(m) can be expressed in terms of K(m) and its derivative.\n\nAlternatively, since the combination given is linear in E(m)K(m) and K(m)^2, perhaps using some quadratic relation. Let's see. Suppose we denote K = K(m), E = E(m). Then the equation is 2√7 E K - (2 + √7) K² = π/2.\n\nDividing both sides by K² (assuming K ≠ 0, which it isn't for m < 1):\n\n2√7 (E/K) - (2 + √7) = π/(2 K²)\n\nLet’s denote x = E/K. Then the equation becomes:\n\n2√7 x - (2 + √7) = π/(2 K²)\n\nBut π/(2 K²) is a known expression. Wait, from Legendre's relation, we have:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = π/2\n\nBut here, our equation is different. If m is a singular value, sometimes K' and K are related by K' = c K, where c is some constant. Let's check if m is such that the complementary modulus k' relates to k in a way that allows K' = c K.\n\nGiven m = (8 - sqrt(63))/16, let's compute k = sqrt(m). Wait, m is already the modulus squared, so k = sqrt(m) = sqrt( (8 - sqrt(63))/16 ) = sqrt(8 - sqrt(63))/4. Let's compute sqrt(8 - sqrt(63)).\n\nAgain, trying to express sqrt(8 - sqrt(63)) as sqrt(a) - sqrt(b). Let's suppose:\n\nsqrt(8 - sqrt(63)) = sqrt(a) - sqrt(b). Then squaring both sides:\n\n8 - sqrt(63) = a + b - 2 sqrt(ab)\n\nThus, we have:\n\na + b = 8\n\n-2 sqrt(ab) = -sqrt(63) => sqrt(ab) = sqrt(63)/2 => ab = 63/4\n\nSame as before. So solving a + b = 8 and ab = 63/4, which gives a=9/2 and b=7/2. Therefore:\n\nsqrt(8 - sqrt(63)) = sqrt(9/2) - sqrt(7/2) = (3 - sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, k = sqrt(m) = (3 - sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2))? Wait, let me compute:\n\nsqrt(m) = sqrt( (8 - sqrt(63))/16 ) = sqrt(8 - sqrt(63)) /4.\n\nWhich we found to be (3 - sqrt(7))/sqrt(2) divided by 4, so:\n\nk = (3 - sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2))\n\nSimilarly, the complementary modulus k' = sqrt(1 - m) = sqrt( (8 + sqrt(63))/16 ) = sqrt(8 + sqrt(63))/4 = (3 + sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2))\n\nTherefore, we have k and k' in terms of sqrt(7). Notice that k' = (3 + sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2)) and k = (3 - sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2))\n\nInteresting. Now, if we compute k * k', we get:\n\n[(3 - sqrt(7))(3 + sqrt(7))]/( (4 sqrt(2))^2 ) = (9 - 7)/(16 * 2) )= 2/32 = 1/16\n\nSo k k' = 1/16. That's interesting. Also, note that k'/k = (3 + sqrt(7))/(3 - sqrt(7)) = [ (3 + sqrt(7))^2 ]/(9 - 7) )= (9 + 6 sqrt(7) +7)/2 = (16 +6 sqrt(7))/2=8 +3 sqrt(7). So k' /k =8 +3 sqrt(7)\n\nWait, but how does this help? Maybe if we consider the relation between K(k) and K(k'), given that kk' =1/16. However, I'm not sure. Alternatively, since k and k' are related in a specific algebraic way, perhaps they are part of a quadratic equation, and hence K(k) and K(k') could be related through some identity.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for singular values, where K(k) and K(k') are related by K(k') = r K(k) for some rational number r. If this is a singular value, which it might be, given that the result is pi/2, which is similar to Legendre's relation.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that for singular values, the ratio K'/K is algebraic. In this case, given k' = (3 + sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2)) and k = (3 - sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2)), perhaps the ratio K'/K is sqrt(7) or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, let's try plugging into Legendre's relation. Legendre's relation is:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nBut in our problem, the equation is:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nCompare this to Legendre's relation. If we can express E K' and E' K in terms of E K and K^2.\n\nBut in our problem, the equation is in terms of E(m) and K(m), not the complementary integrals. Wait, unless m is the complementary modulus. Wait, no, m is given as (8 - sqrt(63))/16, which we already used to compute k and k'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express E(m) in terms of K(m) and K'(m). For example, there's a formula for E in terms of K and the derivative of K with respect to m. But I need to recall.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity that for singular values, E and K can be expressed in terms of each other. For example, when K' = c K, then Legendre's relation gives E c K + E' K - K c K = pi/2 => c E + E' - c K = pi/(2 K)\n\nBut this is getting a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that for this specific m, there is a relation between E(m) and K(m). Let's assume that E(m) = a K(m) + b, where a and b are constants. Then substitute into the equation.\n\nBut let's see. Suppose E(m) = a K(m). Then the equation becomes:\n\n2 sqrt(7) a K^2 - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nSo (2 sqrt(7) a - (2 + sqrt(7))) K^2 = pi/2\n\nIf this holds, then K^2 = pi/(2 (2 sqrt(7) a - (2 + sqrt(7))))\n\nBut unless K(m) is known, this might not help. Alternatively, maybe if a is chosen such that 2 sqrt(7) a - (2 + sqrt(7)) is related to the expression from Legendre's relation.\n\nAlternatively, let's use Legendre's relation. Since we have:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nWe can try to relate this to the given equation. Let's denote E = E(m), K = K(m), E' = E(m'), K' = K(m'), where m' = 1 - m.\n\nOur target equation is:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nIf we can express E K' + E' K - K K' in terms of E K and K^2, maybe by finding a relation between E', K' and E, K.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that m' is related to m in a way that K' can be expressed as a multiple of K. For example, suppose K' = c K. Then Legendre's relation becomes E c K + E' K - K c K = pi/2 => c E + E' - c K = pi/(2 K)\n\nBut this seems not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if m is such that the elliptic integrals satisfy a quadratic relation. Given that k and k' are algebraic numbers related to sqrt(7), maybe there's a way to combine K and E to form such an equation.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the formula for E in terms of K. There's a formula:\n\nE = (1 - m) K + m dK/dm\n\nBut I need to verify. Recall that dK/dm = [E - (1 - m)K]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\nRearranging, E = (1 - m) K + 2 m (1 - m) dK/dm\n\nAlternatively, from the differential equation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the given combination:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2\n\nLet me factor out K:\n\nK [2 sqrt(7) E - (2 + sqrt(7)) K] = pi/2\n\nIf I can show that the term inside the brackets is pi/(2 K). So:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E - (2 + sqrt(7)) K = pi/(2 K)\n\nMultiplying both sides by K:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we need to prove. Therefore, the equation to prove is equivalent to:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nBut from Legendre's relation, we have:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nSo if we can relate 2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 to E K' + E' K - K K', then maybe we can equate coefficients.\n\nSuppose we set:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = E K' + E' K - K K'\n\nThen equate coefficients:\n\nComparing terms involving E K: 2 sqrt(7) = K'/K\n\nComparing terms involving K^2: -(2 + sqrt(7)) = -K'/K + E'/K\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Let's see:\n\nFrom Legendre's relation:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nIf we can write the left-hand side of the target equation as a combination of E K' and other terms, perhaps by expressing K' and E' in terms of K and E.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that K' = a K and E' = b E + c K. Then substitute into Legendre's relation:\n\nE a K + (b E + c K) K - K a K = pi/2\n\nWhich becomes a E K + b E K + c K^2 - a K^2 = pi/2\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n(a + b) E K + (c - a) K^2 = pi/2\n\nCompare this to the target equation:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nSo if we can set:\n\na + b = 2 sqrt(7)\n\nc - a = -(2 + sqrt(7))\n\nBut we need another equation to solve for a, b, c. However, we might also need to relate K' and E' through their differential equations.\n\nFrom the differential equations:\n\ndK/dm = [E - (1 - m) K]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\ndE/dm = [E - K]/(2 m)\n\nBut since m is a specific constant here, perhaps these derivatives can be expressed in terms of K and E. Alternatively, if we consider the derivative of K with respect to m, but since m is fixed, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for singular values, certain relationships hold between K, E, and pi. For example, when m is a singular value, sometimes E/K is algebraic. Let's compute E/K for this m.\n\nBut unless we have specific values, it's hard to compute. However, maybe using the relation that for a singular value, the ratio E/K satisfies some equation.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the given equation resembles a quadratic equation in E/K. Let's let x = E/K. Then the equation becomes:\n\n2 sqrt(7) x - (2 + sqrt(7)) = pi/(2 K^2)\n\nBut if we can express K in terms of pi, which for singular values, K can often be expressed as a product involving sqrt(pi) and gamma functions. For example, singular values of modulus k_r where K(k_r) can be expressed in terms of gamma functions.\n\nGiven that m = (8 - sqrt(63))/16, which is approximately 0.033, so a small modulus. But I don't recall specific singular values with this modulus. However, perhaps this is a singular value related to the one for which K(k) can be expressed in terms of gamma(1/4), etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the original sum relates to a Ramanujan formula for 1/pi, and it's connected to elliptic integrals, maybe the specific combination of K and E arises from manipulating hypergeometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the hypergeometric expressions for K and E:\n\nK(m) = (pi/2) hypergeom([1/2, 1/2], [1], m)\n\nE(m) = (pi/2) hypergeom([-1/2, 1/2], [1], m)\n\nBut combining these into the equation would require finding a relation between the hypergeometric functions. However, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that for certain m, the hypergeometric functions satisfy quadratic relations. Given that the target equation is quadratic in K and E, perhaps such an identity exists.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the given equation can be rewritten as:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K = (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 + pi/2\n\nDividing both sides by K^2:\n\n2 sqrt(7) (E/K) = (2 + sqrt(7)) + pi/(2 K^2)\n\nLet’s denote x = E/K. Then:\n\n2 sqrt(7) x = (2 + sqrt(7)) + pi/(2 K^2)\n\nBut from Legendre's relation:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nIf we divide both sides by K^2:\n\n(E K')/K^2 + (E' K)/K^2 - K K'/K^2 = pi/(2 K^2)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(E/K)(K'/K) + (E'/K) - (K'/K) = pi/(2 K^2)\n\nLet’s denote y = K'/K. Then:\n\nx y + (E'/K) - y = pi/(2 K^2)\n\nBut E' = E(m'), and m' = 1 - m. So E' is E evaluated at m'. Perhaps there's a relation between E' and E/K or something else.\n\nAlternatively, if we can express E' in terms of E and K, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems a bit too vague. Maybe we need to use specific properties of the modulus m given.\n\nRecall that m = (8 - sqrt(63))/16. Let's compute sqrt(63) which is approximately 7.937, so 8 - sqrt(63) ≈ 0.063, so m ≈ 0.063/16 ≈ 0.0039. Wait, no: 8 - sqrt(63) ≈ 0.063, divided by 16 gives m ≈ 0.00394. But earlier computations showed that k = sqrt(m) ≈ sqrt(0.00394) ≈ 0.0628. So it's a small modulus. For small m, K(m) ≈ pi/2 (1 + m/4 + ...) and E(m) ≈ pi/2 (1 - m/4 - ...). But since m is so small, the integrals are close to pi/2. However, the equation equates a combination of them to pi/2, which suggests that the terms might cancel out. But with coefficients like 2 sqrt(7) and (2 + sqrt(7)), it's not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting m into the equation and using numerical computation to verify. Although the user likely wants an analytical proof, a numerical check could help confirm if the relation holds.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side (LHS) numerically. First, compute m:\n\nm = (8 - sqrt(63))/16 ≈ (8 - 7.937253933)/16 ≈ (0.062746067)/16 ≈ 0.003921629\n\nCompute K(m) and E(m). Since m is small, we can use series expansions, but for better accuracy, use a calculator or known values.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for small m, K(m) ≈ (pi/2)(1 + m/4 + 9m²/64 + ...), E(m) ≈ (pi/2)(1 - m/4 - 3m²/64 - ...).\n\nBut m ≈ 0.0039, so m/4 ≈ 0.00098. So K(m) ≈ (pi/2)(1 + 0.00098) ≈ 1.5707963 * 1.00098 ≈ 1.572337\n\nE(m) ≈ (pi/2)(1 - 0.00098) ≈ 1.5707963 * 0.99902 ≈ 1.569255\n\nThen compute LHS:\n\n2 sqrt(7) * E(m) * K(m) - (2 + sqrt(7)) * K(m)^2\n\nFirst, sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458\n\n2 sqrt(7) ≈ 5.2916\n\n2 + sqrt(7) ≈ 4.6458\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5.2916 * 1.569255 * 1.572337 ≈ 5.2916 * 2.467 ≈ 5.2916 * 2.467 ≈ 13.06\n\nSecond term: 4.6458 * (1.572337)^2 ≈ 4.6458 * 2.472 ≈ 11.48\n\nLHS ≈ 13.06 - 11.48 ≈ 1.58\n\nBut pi/2 ≈ 1.5708, so it's close. Considering the approximations in K and E, this suggests the equation holds numerically. Therefore, the analytical proof should be possible.\n\nGiven that the numerical check works, perhaps the key is to recognize that for this specific m, the combination of E and K satisfies the given relation due to a specific identity or transformation.\n\nAnother approach: use the parameterization of elliptic integrals in terms of the nome q. The nome q is given by q = exp(-pi K'/K). For singular values, q is exp(-pi r) where r is rational. However, this might be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original problem comes from a Ramanujan series for 1/pi, which often rely on specific hypergeometric identities or Clausen's formula. The sum involving binomial coefficients cubed times (42n +5)/2^{12n+4} equals 1/pi. The user mentioned that through identities, they derived an analytical expression leading to the elliptic integral relation. This suggests that the elliptic integral relation is key to proving the series for 1/pi.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the combination of E and K in the given equation arises from expressing the sum as a hypergeometric function related to these integrals, and then equating it to 1/pi.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the given equation can be manipulated to express K in terms of E, or vice versa. For instance, solving for E:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K = (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 + pi/2\n\nDivide both sides by 2 sqrt(7) K:\n\nE = [(2 + sqrt(7))/(2 sqrt(7))] K + pi/(4 sqrt(7) K)\n\nBut this might not be helpful unless we can relate pi/K to another term.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the expression pi/(4 sqrt(7) K) could be related to K' due to Legendre's relation. Let's see.\n\nFrom Legendre's relation:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nSuppose we can solve for pi/2:\n\npi/2 = E K' + E' K - K K'\n\nCompare this to the target equation:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nSo set:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' = 2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2\n\nRearranging terms:\n\nE K' + E' K - K K' - 2 sqrt(7) E K + (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nE (K' - 2 sqrt(7) K) + K (E' - K') + (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = 0\n\nThis seems messy. Let's see if we can express K' and E' in terms of K and E.\n\nFrom the differential equations:\n\ndK/dm = [E - (1 - m) K]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\ndE/dm = [E - K]/(2 m)\n\nBut since m is a specific value, not a variable, maybe evaluating these derivatives at m is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that K and E satisfy certain algebraic relations when evaluated at specific m. For example, perhaps for this m, the following holds:\n\nE = a K + b/(K)\n\nThen substituting into the equation:\n\n2 sqrt(7) (a K + b/K) K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 sqrt(7) a K^2 + 2 sqrt(7) b - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nEquating coefficients:\n\nFor K^2 terms: (2 sqrt(7) a - (2 + sqrt(7))) K^2 = 0\n\nConstant terms: 2 sqrt(7) b = pi/2\n\nSince K^2 is not zero, we need 2 sqrt(7) a - (2 + sqrt(7)) = 0 => a = (2 + sqrt(7))/(2 sqrt(7)) = (2 + sqrt(7))/(2 sqrt(7)).\n\nThen 2 sqrt(7) b = pi/2 => b = pi/(4 sqrt(7))\n\nTherefore, if E can be expressed as a K + b/K, then:\n\nE = [(2 + sqrt(7))/(2 sqrt(7))] K + pi/(4 sqrt(7) K)\n\nBut we need to verify if this expression for E is valid. However, this is speculative. To check, substitute back into the differential equation for E.\n\nAlternatively, recall that from the differential equation:\n\ndE/dm = (E - K)/(2 m)\n\nIf E = a K + b/K, then dE/dm = a dK/dm + b (-1/K²) dK/dm\n\nBut dK/dm = [E - (1 - m) K]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\nSubstituting E = a K + b/K:\n\ndK/dm = [a K + b/K - (1 - m) K]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\n= [ (a - (1 - m)) K + b/K ]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\nThen dE/dm = a [ (a - (1 - m)) K + b/K ]/(2 m (1 - m)) - b/K² [ (a - (1 - m)) K + b/K ]/(2 m (1 - m))\n\nThis seems very complicated. Perhaps this approach isn't fruitful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the given equation resembles a quadratic form in K and E. Maybe there's an identity that directly relates this combination to pi/2 for specific m. Given that the user derived this from a Ramanujan series, which often involve sophisticated modular relations, perhaps this identity is a result of such a modular relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the addition formula for elliptic integrals or transformation formulas. For example, there are formulas that relate K(m) and K((1 - sqrt(1 - m))/(1 + sqrt(1 - m))) etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that m = (8 - sqrt(63))/16. Let's rationalize it:\n\nm = (8 - sqrt(63))/16 = (8 - 3*sqrt(7))/16\n\nHmm, sqrt(63) is 3*sqrt(7). So m = (8 - 3*sqrt(7))/16\n\nPerhaps this is a root of a quadratic equation. Let's see:\n\nLet x = m = (8 - 3 sqrt(7))/16\n\nThen 16 x =8 -3 sqrt(7)\n\nRearranged:\n\n3 sqrt(7) =8 -16x\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n9*7 =64 - 256x + 256x²\n\n63 =64 -256x +256x²\n\nThus, 256x² -256x +1=0\n\nDivide by 256:\n\nx² -x +1/256=0\n\nThus, m satisfies the quadratic equation 256 m² -256 m +1=0\n\nSo m is a solution to 256 m² -256 m +1=0\n\nThis might be useful. Let's write that down:\n\n256 m² -256 m +1=0\n\nDivide by 256:\n\nm² -m +1/256=0\n\nSo discriminant D=1 -4*(1)*(1/256)=1 -1/64=63/64\n\nThus, m=(1 ± sqrt(63)/8)/2\n\nWait, original m is (8 -3 sqrt(7))/16= (1/2) - (3 sqrt(7))/16. Which matches one of the roots:\n\nm=(1 - sqrt(63)/8)/2=(1 - 3 sqrt(7)/8)/2=(8 -3 sqrt(7))/16\n\nYes, so m is a root of 256 m² -256 m +1=0.\n\nThis is significant because it's a quadratic equation with a discriminant related to 63 (which is 7*9), suggesting that the modulus has a special property related to this quadratic equation.\n\nGiven that m satisfies 256m² -256m +1=0, perhaps we can use this to find a relation between K(m) and E(m).\n\nAlternatively, consider the hypergeometric differential equation satisfied by K(m). Since K(m) is a solution to the hypergeometric differential equation, and m is algebraic, there might be a way to use this quadratic relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the quadratic equation in m can be used to relate K(m) and K(1 - m), but 1 - m is also a root of the equation 256(1 - m)^2 -256(1 - m)+1=0. Let's check:\n\n256(1 -m)^2 -256(1 -m) +1=0\n\nExpand (1 -m)^2=1 -2m +m²\n\nThus:\n\n256(1 -2m +m²) -256(1 -m) +1=0\n\n=256 -512m +256m² -256 +256m +1=0\n\n= (256 -256) + (-512m +256m) +256m² +1=0\n\n= -256m +256m² +1=0\n\nWhich is 256m² -256m +1=0, same as before. So 1 -m is also a root. Therefore, m' =1 -m is the other root.\n\nTherefore, both m and m' satisfy the same quadratic equation. This suggests that K(m) and K(m') are related through this equation. Perhaps there's a relationship between their corresponding elliptic integrals.\n\nGiven that both m and m' are roots of the same quadratic equation, and given that k and k' are related as we computed earlier, maybe there's a way to express K(m') in terms of K(m).\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that K(m) and K(m') are solutions to a hypergeometric differential equation that can be related through quadratic transformations.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the quadratic equation for m allows us to express K(m') in terms of K(m). Given that m' =1 -m, and both satisfy the same equation, perhaps there's a symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, recall that when m and m' are related through a quadratic equation, there might be a transformation that relates K(m) and K(m'). For example, Landen's transformation or Gauss's transformation. Let's consider Landen's transformation.\n\nLanden's transformation relates K(k) to K((1 - k')/(1 + k')) or similar. Let's check.\n\nThe Landen transformation formula is:\n\nK(k) = (1 + k') K((1 - k')/(1 + k')) /2\n\nBut I need to verify. Alternatively, there's the ascending Landen transformation:\n\nIf we set k1 = 2 sqrt(k)/(1 + k), then K(k) = (1 + k) K(k1)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, given that k and k' are related via k k' =1/16, as we computed earlier, and k' = (3 + sqrt(7))/(4 sqrt(2)), which is much larger than k, maybe there's a way to use a reciprocal modulus relation.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for complementary moduli. Given that k k' =1/16, perhaps there's a formula that relates K(k) and K(k').\n\nBut generally, K(k) and K(k') are related through the nome q, but unless there's a specific product formula for them.\n\nAlternatively, since k k' =1/16, and given that K(k) and K(k') are related through the imaginary modulus transformation, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Given the time I've spent without a clear path, perhaps I should look for existing literature or resources that might have this specific identity.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the given equation resembles a scaled Legendre relation. If we multiply Legendre's relation by a constant factor, can we match the coefficients?\n\nLegendre's relation: E K' + E' K - K K' = pi/2\n\nSuppose we multiply both sides by some constant c:\n\nc E K' + c E' K - c K K' = c pi/2\n\nCompare to the target equation:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nTo make the terms match, we'd need to express c E K' as 2 sqrt(7) E K and other terms accordingly. But this would require c K' = 2 sqrt(7) K, and similarly for other terms. Let's see:\n\nIf c K' = 2 sqrt(7) K, then c = 2 sqrt(7) K / K'\n\nSimilarly, c E' = -(2 + sqrt(7)) K\n\nBut this seems too forced. Unless K' = a K and E' = b K, then:\n\nc a K = 2 sqrt(7) K => c a = 2 sqrt(7)\n\nc b K = -(2 + sqrt(7)) K => c b = -(2 + sqrt(7))\n\nThen from Legendre's scaled equation:\n\nc E K' + c E' K - c K K' = c pi/2\n\nSubstituting K' = a K and E' = b K:\n\nc E a K + c b K K - c K a K = c pi/2\n\nFactor out c K:\n\nc K (a E + b K - a K) = c pi/2\n\nCancel c (assuming c ≠ 0):\n\nK (a E + b K - a K) = pi/2\n\nThus:\n\na E K + (b - a) K^2 = pi/2\n\nCompare to the target equation:\n\n2 sqrt(7) E K - (2 + sqrt(7)) K^2 = pi/2\n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\na = 2 sqrt(7)\n\nb - a = -(2 + sqrt(7))\n\nThus, b = -(2 + sqrt(7)) + a = -(2 + sqrt(7)) + 2 sqrt(7)) = -2 + sqrt(7))\n\nBut we also have from earlier:\n\nc a = 2 sqrt(7) => c = 2 sqrt(7)/a = 2 sqrt(7)/(2 sqrt(7)) = 1\n\nSimilarly, c b = -(2 + sqrt(7)) => b = -(2 + sqrt(7))\n\nBut we derived b = -2 + sqrt(7)), which conflicts unless:\n\n-2 + sqrt(7)) = -(2 + sqrt(7)) => which is not true. This suggests inconsistency, meaning this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, scaling Legendre's relation doesn't directly help.\n\nGiven that all these avenues haven't led to a solution, perhaps the key is to use the specific value of m and relate it to known singular values or use theta functions. However, given time constraints and complexity, the most viable path is to recognize that the given equation is a form of Legendre's relation with specific coefficients derived from the particular modulus m. Given the numerical verification holds, the analytical proof would involve leveraging the properties of m being a root of a quadratic equation and applying transformations or identities in elliptic integrals specific to that modulus.",
