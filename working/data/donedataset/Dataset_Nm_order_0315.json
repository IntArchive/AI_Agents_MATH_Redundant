    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving an identity involving binomial coefficients and the Kronecker delta. The user wants the assumptions and problem statement formatted in a specific way. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original question: The problem states that for integers m and n greater than or equal to 0, the sum from k = m to n of (-1)^(k-m) * binomial(k, m) * binomial(n, k) equals delta_{mn}, which is 1 if m = n and 0 otherwise. The user also mentioned a tag related to linear algebra, thinking there's a matrix approach, but that's probably part of the note, not the problem statement.\n\nSo, for the assumptions part, I need to list each condition. The problem states m and n are integers greater than or equal to 0. So each of these should be separate assumptions. But the example had two assumptions for the same variable (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the conditions are m and n are integers, and m, n ≥ 0. But since m and n are both mentioned, should I list each condition for each variable?\n\nWait, the example listed two assumptions for the same variable n. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- m is an integer,\n- n is an integer,\n- m ≥ 0,\n- n ≥ 0.\n\nBut the original problem states \"let m, n ≥ 0 be two integers\", which combines the two conditions (they are integers and non-negative). However, according to the example, each assumption should be one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\", and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the example broke down the original problem's conditions into separate lines. Similarly, here, the original problem says \"Let m, n ≥ 0 be two integers\", which can be broken down into:\n\n- m is an integer,\n- n is an integer,\n- m ≥ 0,\n- n ≥ 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applying to one object (m or n) with one condition. Therefore, that's four assumptions. However, sometimes in such cases, \"m and n are integers\" is considered one condition, but according to the example, each variable's condition is separate. Wait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" was one assumption, and \"n is divisible by 7\" another. So for m and n, since they are two different variables, each gets their own lines.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, m and n are both mentioned as being integers and ≥0. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nm is a non-negative integer,\n\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut wait, \"non-negative integer\" combines two conditions: being an integer and being ≥0. But according to the example's formatting, each condition is separate. So maybe:\n\n- m is an integer,\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- m ≥ 0,\n\n- n ≥ 0.\n\nBut that would be four lines. However, the original problem says \"Let m,n ≥ 0 be two integers\", which combines the two. But in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate. Therefore, following that logic, here, \"m and n are integers\" and \"m and n are ≥0\" would be split into four separate assumptions. But maybe that's overkill. Alternatively, perhaps \"m is a non-negative integer\" is considered a single condition, since non-negative includes being an integer. Wait, but the problem statement says \"Let m,n be two integers greater than or equal to 0\". So the two conditions are that they are integers and that they are ≥0. So each variable has two conditions. So for each variable:\n\n- m is an integer,\n\n- m ≥ 0,\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n ≥ 0.\n\nBut that's four separate assumptions. Alternatively, maybe each variable's two conditions can be combined into one line each, but the example suggests splitting them. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So if the original problem says \"m and n are integers ≥0\", then each variable's conditions (integer and ≥0) should be split. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nm is an integer,\n\nn is an integer,\n\nm is greater than or equal to 0,\n\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nYes, that would be four lines, each applying one condition to one object. That seems to align with the example provided.\n\nNow the problem statement is to prove that the given sum equals the Kronecker delta. The problem part should restate the problem, including the equation. The original problem has the sum from k=m to n of (-1)^{k-m} * binom(k, m) * binom(n, k) = delta_{mn}.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the problem part as: Prove that sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^{k-m} binom(k, m) binom(n, k) = delta_{mn}, where delta_{mn} is Kronecker delta.\n\nBut in the example, the problem included the definition of delta_{mn} as a case statement. However, in the original problem, the user already defines delta_{mn}. Should that definition be included in the problem statement?\n\nThe example included the definition of A(n) but not the definition of divisibility. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. So the problem statement included the definition of A(n). Here, the problem statement includes the definition of delta_{mn}. So yes, to make it self-contained, the problem statement should define delta_{mn}.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement should be:\n\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^{k-m} \\binom{k}{m} \\binom{n}{k} = \\delta_{mn}$$ where $\\delta_{mn}$ is defined by $\\delta_{mn} = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } m = n; \\\\ 0, & \\text{if } m \\neq n \\end{cases}$.\n\nBut to match the example, which didn't redefine the standard terms (like divisibility), but in the example, the user defined delta_{mn} in the original problem, so it's part of the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include the definition of delta_{mn} as given in the original question.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nm is an integer,\n\nn is an integer,\n\nm is greater than or equal to 0,\n\nn is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that $$\\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^{k-m} \\binom{k}{m} \\binom{n}{k} = \\delta_{mn}$$ where $\\delta_{mn}$ is defined by $\\delta_{mn} = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } m = n; \\\\ 0, & \\text{if } m \\neq n \\end{cases}$.\n\nBut wait, the example's problem statement didn't repeat the definition of divisibility because it's standard, but here Kronecker delta might not be considered standard. However, in the original problem, the user included the definition. Therefore, to be precise, we should include the definition in the problem statement, as in the original question.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should be as above.",
