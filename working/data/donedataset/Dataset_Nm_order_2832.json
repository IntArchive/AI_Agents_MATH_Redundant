    "Content": "I know there are a lot of answers regarding continuity of polynomials. But, this question is different. We need to have $ \\lim_{x\\to a} {x^n} = a^n$ , $n \\in N$ , to be able to prove that polynomials are continuous. This fact is derived from the product rule (or may be it can't be, which is my question). The product rule is proved using square roots, so it assumes the existence of square roots.  The fact that For every non negative number $x$ , it's $n^{th}$ root exists, i.e. $x^n$ is invertible, assumes the continuity of $x^n$ because this is proven using Intermediate value Theorem. Bam - Circular reasoning ! Or am I Wrong ? \nHere's the only proof of product rule which I know :\nAssume $ \\lim_{x\\to a} {f(x)} = L$ and $ \\lim_{x\\to a} {g(x)} = K$ Let $ϵ > 0$ be any positive number\nHence, $∃\\delta_1> 0 ∶ 0<|x-a|<δ_1⟹|f(x)-L|<\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ And $∃δ_2>0 ∶ 0<|x-a|<δ_2 ⟹ |g(x)-K|<\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$ Let $δ=\\min\\{δ_1,δ_2\\}$ Hence, $0<|x-a|<δ$ ⟹ $|(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)-0|<\\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\sqrt{\\epsilon} = ϵ$ Hence, $\\lim_{x \\to a} {(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)} = 0$ ⟹ $\\lim_{x \\to a} {(f(x)g(x)-Kf(x)-Lg(x)+KL)} = 0$ And then the result follows. \nEven if we use $\\epsilon$ in place of $√ϵ$ , we end up with $0<|x-a|<δ⟹|(f(x)-L)(g(x)-K)-0|<\\epsilon\\cdot \\epsilon = ϵ^2$ , and then we have to prove that the range of $\\epsilon^2$ is $[0,\\infty]$ , which amounts to proving that for each number in $[0,\\infty]$ , a corresponding square root exists.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proof that the product of continuous functions is also continuous does not need to use square roots. You could add the condition that $0 < \\epsilon < 1$ , in which case $\\epsilon^2 < \\epsilon$ . Or you could use a convergent sequence $x_n$ such that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\mathop \\to \\infty} x_n = a$ , and show that $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}f(x_n)g(x_n) = f\\left( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n \\right)g\\left(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n\\right) = f(a)g(a)$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is concerned about circular reasoning when proving that polynomials are continuous. They mention that proving the continuity of x^n relies on the product rule, which in turn might depend on the existence of roots (using the Intermediate Value Theorem), creating a loop. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The key points from the question are:\n1. The limit of x^n as x approaches a is a^n.\n2. The product rule for limits is used in proving continuity of polynomials.\n3. The product rule's proof might assume the existence of square roots, which requires the Intermediate Value Theorem, implying continuity of x^n.\n4. The user presents a specific proof of the product rule using epsilon-delta with square roots, leading to the question of circularity.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include each of these points. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse them:\n\n- The continuity of polynomials depends on the product rule for limits.\n- The product rule's proof uses square roots.\n- The existence of nth roots (which is needed for the product rule proof) is proven using the Intermediate Value Theorem, which requires the continuity of x^n.\n- There's a dependency cycle here: using IVT (which needs continuity) to prove root existence, which is used in the product rule, which is used to prove continuity.\n\nNow, structuring the problem. The user wants to know if this is circular reasoning or if there's a way around it. The problem is essentially to prove the continuity of polynomials without circularity, addressing the dependencies mentioned.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each of these dependencies as separate points, and the problem is to resolve the circularity or confirm it.",
