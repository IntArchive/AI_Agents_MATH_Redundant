    "Content": "Suppose $A$ and $B$ are measurable subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ of finite  positive measure. Show that the convolution $\\chi_A*\\chi_B$ is continuous and not identically $0$. Use this to prove that $A+B$ contains a segment. We have $$(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\chi_A(x-y)\\chi_B(y)~dm(y)$$ For $y\\notin B$ we have $\\chi_B(y)=0$. So, $$(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(x)=\\int_B\\chi_A(x-y)~dm(y)$$ For $x-y\\notin A$ we have $\\chi_A(x-y)=0$ $x-y\\in A\\Rightarrow y\\in x-A$ so, we have $y\\in B\\cap (x-A)$. So, $$(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(x)=\\int_{B\\cap(x-A)}~dm(y)=m(B\\cap(x-A))$$ So, $$(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(x)=m(B\\cap(x-A))$$ EDIT 1 : Consider $x_n\\rightarrow x $ ( converging sequence) then i see that $$\\cdots (B\\cap(x_n-A))\\supseteq (B\\cap(x_{n+1}-A))\\supseteq(B\\cap(x_{n+2}-A))\\supseteq\\cdots (B\\cap(x-A))$$ So, $m(B\\cap (x_n-A))\\rightarrow m(B\\cap (x-A))$ (EDIT : i have said this before but then some one said that convergence may not imply that containment but now i tried and i strongly feel it holds if it converges) I guess this would be sufficient to say that convolution is continuous.... $\\epsilon-\\delta$ way of proving continuity.. Given $\\epsilon >0$ i have to choose $\\delta>0$ such that $|x-y|<\\delta$ implies $$\\big|(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(x)-(\\chi_A*\\chi_B)(y)\\big|=\\big|m(B\\cap(x-A))-m(B\\cap(y-A))\\big|<\\epsilon$$ I know $m(A)-m(B)=m(A\\cap B^c)$ if $B\\subset A$. I am not so sure if that holds in general or if it holds at least in this case... Suppose every thing is super perfect then i would get $$\\big|m(B\\cap(x-A))-m(B\\cap(y-A))\\big|=\\big|m(B\\cap(x-A))\\cap (B\\cap(y-A))^c\\big|=\\big| m(B\\cap (x-A)\\cap (y-A)^c)\\big|$$ I do not know where to go from here.. Even if i prove this is continuous i am not very sure how to use this and prove that $A+B$ contains a segment... Please suggest some path...",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is another proof for the continuity of $\\chi_A*\\chi_B$ . Let us in fact show, more generally, that if $f$ is integrable on $\\mathbb R$ and $g$ is measurable and bounded, then $f*g$ is a continuous function. (Then take $f:=\\chi_A$ and $g:=\\chi_B$ , of course). The function $f*g(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb R} f(x-y)g(y)\\, dy$ is clearly well-defined at every point $x\\in\\mathbb R$ . Moreover, one may write $$f*g(x)=\\int_{\\mathbb R} \\tau_x f(y) g(y)\\, dy\\, ,$$ where $\\tau_xf(y)=f(x-y)$ . In an even more formal way, $$f*g(x)=\\Phi_g (\\tau_x f)\\, ,$$ where $\\Phi_g :L^1(\\mathbb R)\\to \\mathbb R$ is the linear functional defined by $\\Phi_g(u)=\\int_{\\mathbb R} u(y)g(y)\\, dy$ . This makes sense, and $\\Phi_g$ is a continuous linear functional on $L^1(\\mathbb R)$ , because $g$ is bounded. So, to prove that $f*g$ is a continuous function, you only have to check that the map $x\\mapsto \\tau_x f$ is continuous from $\\mathbb R$ into $L^1(\\mathbb R)$ . But now, there is no miracle: you need to use some approximation argument, just like in the other answers already given to your question. For example, you can first check that the map $x\\mapsto \\tau_x f$ is indeed continuous if $f$ is continuous and compactly supported (this should cause no difficulty); and then, taking a sequence $(f_n)$ of continuous and compactly supported functions tending to $f$ with respect to the $L^1$ norm, observe that $\\tau_xf_n\\to \\tau_x f$ uniformly on $\\mathbb R$ as $n\\to\\infty$ , because $\\Vert \\tau_x f_n-\\tau_x f\\Vert_{L^1}=\\Vert f_n-f\\Vert_{L^1}$ . (A proof can be found on Real and Complex Analysis, 3rd Edition , theorem 9.5. In fact, this function is uniformly continuous from $\\mathbb{R}$ into $L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ where $1 \\le p < \\infty$ )",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down the problem step by step. The user has a question on Math Stack Exchange about convolutions of characteristic functions and proving that A+B contains a segment. The task is to structure this problem into the specified format by listing assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the key elements in the original question. The user mentions that A and B are measurable subsets of R with finite positive measure. They want to show two things: that the convolution χ_A * χ_B is continuous and not identically zero, and then use that to prove that A + B contains a segment.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be about the properties of A and B. Let's list them:\n\n1. A is a measurable subset of R. (Each assumption should address one property of one object.)\n2. B is a measurable subset of R. (Separate from A.)\n3. A has finite positive measure. (Finite and positive are two conditions, but maybe combine since they apply to the same object. Wait, the format says each assumption should address only one property or condition per line. So maybe split into two: A has finite measure, and A has positive measure. Similarly for B. But the original problem says \"finite positive measure\". Hmm. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition for the same object. So here, for A: measurable, finite measure, positive measure. Similarly for B. But each as separate lines? The user example had two lines for n. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a measurable subset of ℝ,\nA has finite measure,\nA has positive measure,\nB is a measurable subset of ℝ,\nB has finite measure,\nB has positive measure.\n\nBut maybe in the original problem, the user wrote \"measurable subsets of ℝ of finite positive measure\". So \"finite positive measure\" is a single condition? But according to the example, the original problem mentioned \"divisible by 91\" and the formatted assumption split into \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the original problem didn't mention n being an integer, but the user added it? Wait in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was that n is an integer. Then the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. So maybe the example had a typo? Wait, perhaps the original problem had n as an integer, but the formatted problem includes assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, no. The original problem's formatted version's assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number is divisible by 91. So maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem with some hidden assumptions. But regardless, the example shows that each assumption is listed line by line, even if multiple conditions apply to the same object. So in this case, for A and B, each has three conditions: being measurable, finite measure, and positive measure. But according to the example, each line is a separate condition. So for A, first line: A is a measurable subset of ℝ. Second line: A has finite measure. Third line: A has positive measure. Similarly for B. So six assumptions in total. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"measurable subsets of ℝ of finite positive measure.\" So \"finite positive measure\" is a single condition? But according to the example, when the problem said \"for every integer n\", it was split into \"n is an integer\" as a separate assumption. So perhaps \"finite positive measure\" can be split into \"A has finite measure\" and \"A has positive measure\". Similarly for B. So yes, six assumptions. Then the problem is to show the convolution is continuous and not identically zero, and use that to prove A+B contains a segment.\n\nBut wait, the problem is in two parts. The user is asking to show two things: 1) convolution is continuous and not identically zero, 2) use this to prove A+B contains a segment. So should the problem statement include both parts? According to the example, the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91, which was the original problem. So here, the problem statement should be as in the original question: \"Show that the convolution χ_A * χ_B is continuous and not identically 0. Use this to prove that A + B contains a segment.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list all assumptions (measurable, finite measure, positive measure for both A and B), and then the problem statement as given. The user's original problem includes all these conditions. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal question: \"Suppose A and B are measurable subsets of ℝ of finite positive measure. Show that the convolution χ_A * χ_B is continuous and not identically 0. Use this to prove that A + B contains a segment.\"\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a measurable subset of ℝ\n\n- A has finite measure\n\n- A has positive measure\n\n- B is a measurable subset of ℝ\n\n- B has finite measure\n\n- B has positive measure\n\nEach of these as separate lines in the Assumption section.\n\nThen the Problem is: Show that the convolution χ_A * χ_B is continuous and not identically 0. Use this to prove that A + B contains a segment.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition per line. So yes, each of the six points above. Then the problem statement as given.\n\nNow, the user's example included in the problem had some edits where they discussed their attempts. However, the task is to filter out the unrelated information. The user's own edits and thought process (like EDIT 1, etc.) should be ignored, focusing only on the core problem. The original problem statement is at the beginning of the question, so that's what we need to structure.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should have the six assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
