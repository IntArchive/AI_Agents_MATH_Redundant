    "Content": "Let $A$ be the set of all $a\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ for which there exist $x,y,z\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ not all $=0$ such that $$a=\\frac{xy+yz+zx}{x^2+y^2+z^2}.$$ Prove that $$a\\in A\\iff \\frac{1}{2}-a\\in A.$$ Note: This is a special case of a more general result I discovered while investigating Diophantines of the form $a(x^2+y^2+z^2)=b(xy+yz+zx)$ and already have a solution using methods I invented for that purpose, but this is indirect/unmotivated. I am looking for a more direct solution. It might help to know the \"more general result:\" Proposition. If $b\\in A$ then $a\\in A\\iff \\frac{b-a}{1+a-2ab}\\in A.$ However, none of these look as nice as the case where $b=\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1\\cdot 1+1\\cdot 4+4\\cdot 1}{1^2+1^2+4^2}$, which gives rise to the above problem: $a\\in A\\iff \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}-a}{1+a-a}=\\frac{1}{2}-a\\in A.$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let\n$$\na = \\frac{xy+yz+zx}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\n$$\nas above, note that this is equivalent to \n$$ \n1+2a = \\frac{(x+y+z)^2}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\n$$ and let $a'=\\frac12-a$.\nIf $x=y=z$ then $a=1$ and\n$$\na' = -\\frac12 = \\frac{-1\\cdot 2 -1\\cdot 2 + 1}{(-1)^2+(-1)^2+2^2} \\in A\n$$\nOtherwise, if $x,y,z$ are not all equal then\n$$\n1+2a' = 2-2a = \\frac{u+v+w}{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \\frac{(u+v+w)^2}{u^2+v^2+w^2}\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nu = x^2+y^2-z(x+y) \\\\\nv = y^2+z^2-x(y+z) \\\\\nw = z^2+x^2-y(z+x) \\\\\nu+v+w = (x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2>0\n$$\nclearly $u,v,w$ are not all zero and hence\n$$\na' = \\frac{uv+vw+wu}{u^2+v^2+w^2} \\in A\n$$\nThus $a\\in A \\implies \\frac12-a \\in A$, and the other direction follows immediately because $a'\\in A \\implies \\frac12-a' = a \\in A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a set A defined as all rational numbers a such that there exist integers x, y, z (not all zero) where a equals (xy + yz + zx) divided by (x² + y² + z²). The task is to prove that a is in A if and only if (1/2 - a) is also in A.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me break down the problem.\n\nThe set A is defined by the existence of integers x, y, z (not all zero) such that a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²). So the first assumption would be about the definition of A. Then, the problem statement is the equivalence between a being in A and (1/2 - a) being in A. The note mentions that it's a special case of a more general proposition, but the user wants a direct solution. However, the user also provides the general result where if b is in A, then a is in A iff (b - a)/(1 + a - 2ab) is in A. For the specific problem, b is 1/2, which simplifies the expression. But since the problem is the specific case, perhaps the only assumption needed is the definition of A and the specific condition for b=1/2. Wait, but in the formatted example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the main assumption is the definition of A. The problem is to show the bi-conditional. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- A is the set of a ∈ ℚ such that there exist x, y, z ∈ ℤ, not all zero, with a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n- The problem requires proving that a ∈ A ⇨ (1/2 - a) ∈ A.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property. So the first assumption is the definition of set A. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem states: Let A be the set of all a ∈ ℚ for which there exist x,y,z ∈ ℤ not all =0 such that a=(xy+yz+zx)/(x²+y²+z²). So that's one assumption about how A is defined.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is defined as {a ∈ ℚ | ∃x,y,z ∈ ℤ, not all zero, such that a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²)}.\n- The problem is to prove a ∈ A ⇨ (1/2 - a) ∈ A and vice versa.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem's assumption is the definition of A. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumption should list all the given conditions. Wait, in the example, the user's formatted problem included the assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\", but the example added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't add \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be a mistake. Hmm, perhaps I should ignore that and just follow the instruction, which says to list the assumptions as per the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is the set of all a ∈ ℚ such that there exist integers x, y, z (not all zero) with a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n2. The problem requires proving the equivalence a ∈ A ⇨ (1/2 - a) ∈ A.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So maybe the first assumption is about the definition of A, which is one property. Then the problem is the equivalence statement. Wait, but the example's formatted problem included two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption should be n is an integer. But then where did the \"n is divisible by 7\" come from? Wait, maybe the example had a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be n is an integer. The conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. This suggests that the example might have a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I should follow the instruction to list the assumptions as per the problem given.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- A is defined as all a in ℚ where there exist integers x, y, z (not all zero) such that a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumption should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is the set of all a ∈ ℚ such that there exist x, y, z ∈ ℤ (not all zero) with a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n\nProblem:\nProve that a ∈ A ⇨ (1/2 − a) ∈ A.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption line addresses only one property applied to one object. So maybe breaking down the definition into parts? For example:\n\n- For a ∈ ℚ, a ∈ A if there exist x, y, z ∈ ℤ (not all zero) such that a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n\nBut the definition of A is a single condition. So perhaps the assumption is just that definition. Then the problem is the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the denominator x² + y² + z² is non-zero, but since x, y, z are not all zero, that's already covered.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nA is the set of a ∈ ℚ where there exist x, y, z ∈ ℤ (not all zero) such that a = (xy + yz + zx)/(x² + y² + z²).\n\nProblem:\nProve that a ∈ A ⇨ (1/2 − a) ∈ A.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions on a, other than its definition. The note mentions a general result, but the problem is to prove the specific case. Therefore, the assumption is solely the definition of set A.",
