    "Content": "Let $(A,+,\\cdot)$ be a ring such that there are $a,b \\in A$ which satisfy $$(a+b)^2=a^2+b^2, \\quad (a+b)^3=a^3+b^3$$\n  Prove that $(a+b)^n=a^n+b^n,$ for all positive integers $n.$ I have found the following solution, but I am not quite satisfied with it. From the hypothesis we get $ab+ba=0$ and $ab^2+ba^2=0.$ We will prove the identity using induction. Suppose that it is true for $1,2,...,n-1, \\: n \\geq 4.$ We can write $$(a+b)^n=(a+b)^{n-1}(a+b)=(a^{n-1}+b^{n-1})(a+b)=a^n+a^{n-1}b+b^{n-1}a+b^n$$\nIt is left to prove that $a^{n-1}b+b^{n-1}a=0.$ We can write $$a^{n-1}b+b^{n-1}a=a^{n-2}ab+b^{n-2}ba=-a^{n-2}ba-b^{n-2}ab \\quad (*)$$\nBut $(a+b)^{n-1}=(a+b)^{n-2}(a+b)=(a^{n-2}+b^{n-2})(a+b)=a^{n-1}+b^{n-1},$ so $$a^{n-2}b+b^{n-2}a=0 \\Rightarrow b^{n-2}a=-a^{n-2}b$$\nPlugging this back in $(*)$ gives $$a^{n-1}b+b^{n-1}a=-a^{n-2}ba+a^{n-2}b^2=a^{n-2}(-ba+b^2)=a^{n-3}ab(-a+b)$$\nBut $0=ab^2+ba^2=ab^2-aba=ab(b-a),$ so $$a^{n-1}b+b^{n-1}a=a^{n-3}\\cdot 0 = 0$$ and this completes the indution. Is there any other solution, maybe quicker or more beautiful?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is the same, but maybe rearranged to see an idea of norming (non-commutative) monomials in $a,b$. As noticed in the OP, from $a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+ab+ba+b^2$ we get the \"supercommutativity relation\"\n$$\nab=  -ba\\ .\n$$\nThe other relation, extended as  $a^3+b^3=(a+b)^3=(a+b)^2(a+b)=(a^2+b^2)(a+b)=a^3+a^2b+b^2a+b^3$ gives as in the OP\n$$\na^2b=-b^2a\\ .\n$$ We start now a \"new\" proof. (Essentially the same.) The strategy being to write each monomial in $a,b$ in a \"normalized form\". First, using supercommutativity we can write any monomial $aa\\dots abb\\dots baa\\dots a bb\\dots b\\dots$ in the form $\\pm aa\\dots a\\ aa\\dots a\\ \\dots bb\\dots b\\ bb\\dots b\\dots$ by pushing all $a$'s in the front and changing signs. Using the second rule, we can reduce the $a$ powers in front of the $b$'s to get a \"normalized\" monomial of the shape $\\pm b^?a$. Let us show inductively the relation $a^nb=-b^na$, starting from the given one for $n=2$. For $n\\ge 2$ we have\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na^{n+1}b\n&=\naa^n b\\\\\n&=\n-ab^n a&&\\text{(by induction)}\\\\\n&=\n-(-1)^n aa b^n&&\\text{(by supercommutativity)}\\\\\n&=-(-1)^n a^2 \\underbrace{bbb\\dots b}_{n\\text{ times}}\\\\\n&=-(-1)^n(- b^2 a)\\underbrace{bb\\dots b}_{n-1\\text{ times}}\\\\\n&=+(-1)^n b^2\\ (a\\underbrace{bb\\dots b}_{n-1\\text{ times}})\\\\\n&=+(-1)^n b^2\\ (-1)^{n-1}\\underbrace{bb\\dots b}_{n-1\\text{ times}}a&&\\text{(by supercommutativity)}\\\\\n&=-b^{n+1}a\\ .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe wanted relation now follows also inductively,\n$$\n(a+b)^{n+1}=(a^n+b^n)(a+b)=a^{n+1}+\\underbrace{a^nb+b^na}_{=0\\text{ shown above}}+b^{n+1}\n=\na^{n+1}+b^{n+1}\n\\ .$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is talking about a ring (A, +, ·) where there exist elements a and b such that (a + b)^2 = a² + b² and (a + b)^3 = a³ + b³. They want to prove that (a + b)^n = a^n + b^n for all positive integers n. The user also mentions a solution involving induction and certain algebraic manipulations, but they're looking for an alternative, possibly quicker or more elegant solution.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a ring with specific properties. The key conditions are:\n\n1. The ring is denoted as (A, +, ·).\n2. There exist elements a and b in A such that (a + b)² = a² + b².\n3. Additionally, (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nThese are the main assumptions. Each should be a separate line in the Assumption section. Let me check if there are any more implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions the ring structure, so we assume the standard ring axioms (closure under operations, associativity of addition, distributivity, etc.), but those are part of the definition of a ring and don't need to be listed unless specified. The problem doesn't state any additional constraints like commutativity (other than what's derived from the given equations) or characteristic, so the explicit assumptions are the existence of a and b with those two equations.\n\nSo, the Assumption section should list each condition applied to the elements a and b. Each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. In this case:\n\n- The first condition is (a + b)² = a² + b². This leads to ab + ba = 0 when expanded.\n- The second condition is (a + b)³ = a³ + b³. Expanding this gives terms that lead to ab² + ba² = 0.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement, the user doesn't explicitly state these derived conditions (ab + ba = 0 and ab² + ba² = 0) as assumptions. The original problem only gives the two equations (a + b)^2 and (a + b)^3. Therefore, the assumptions should be those given in the problem, not the derived ones. The user's solution uses those derived equations, but the problem itself states the conditions on the powers of (a + b).\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- The ring is (A, +, ·).\n- There exist elements a, b in A such that (a + b)² = a² + b².\n- There exist elements a, b in A such that (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"there are a, b in A which satisfy both equations\". So maybe each equation is a separate assumption. Let me structure that:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nThere exist a, b ∈ A such that (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nThere exist a, b ∈ A such that (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the two equations are given together for the same a and b. So it's not that there exist a, b for the square and some (possibly different) a, b for the cube. It's the same a and b satisfying both. So the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nThere exist elements a, b in A such that (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nThere exist elements a, b in A such that (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem states \"there are a,b ∈ A which satisfy [both equations]\". So maybe better to write it as:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nThere exist a, b ∈ A such that (a + b)² = a² + b² and (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nBut according to the example given, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. So splitting them:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nThere exist a, b ∈ A such that (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nThere exist a, b ∈ A such that (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nBut in the problem, it's the same a and b satisfying both equations. So maybe better to phrase as:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nThere exist elements a, b in A satisfying (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nThe same elements a, b in A satisfy (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nElements a and b in A satisfy (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nElements a and b in A satisfy (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nThis way, each equation is a separate assumption about the same elements a and b.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each equation is a separate condition applied to the elements a and b.\n\nSo the Assumption section would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nElements a and b in A satisfy (a + b)² = a² + b²,\nElements a and b in A satisfy (a + b)³ = a³ + b³.\n\nThen the Problem is to prove that (a + b)^n = a^n + b^n for all positive integers n.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n(A, +, ⋅) is a ring,\nElements a and b in A satisfy $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$,\nElements a and b in A satisfy $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3$.\nProblem: \nProve that $(a + b)^n = a^n + b^n$ for all positive integers $n$.\n###",
