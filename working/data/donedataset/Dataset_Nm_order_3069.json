    "Content": "Let $(a_n)$ be a positive and monotonically increasing sequence that\nsatisfies $$ a_{n \\cdot m} \\geq n a_m \\; \\; \\; \\; \\text{for} \\; \\; n,m \\in\n \\mathbb{N} $$ Suppose $\\sup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\left\\{ \\dfrac{a_n}{n} \\right\\} < +\n \\infty $ , Prove ${\\bf carefully}$ that $\\left( \\dfrac{ a_n }{n}\n \\right) $ ${\\bf converges}$ Attempt: By hypothesis, if $\\alpha$ is the supremum of the sequence, then $\\dfrac{a_n}{n} \\leq \\alpha $ so we observe that $(a_n/n)$ is bounded. If we can prove that is monotonic, then we are done. Let $b_n = a_n/n$ . Then, we have $$ \\dfrac{b_{n+1} }{b_n} = \\dfrac{n}{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} > \\dfrac{n}{n+1} $$ Which leads nowhere. But, if we use the property of the sequence with $m=1$ we see that $$ a_n \\geq n a_1 $$ And in particular with $n$ replaced by $n+1$ one sees that $a_{n+1} \\geq (n+1) a_1 $ or that $\\dfrac{ a_{n+1} }{n+1} \\geq a_1 $ . Now, Id be tempted to say that $$ \\dfrac{ a_{n+1} }{n+1} - \\dfrac{ a_n }{n} \\geq a_1 - a_1 = 0 $$ but unfortunaly the inequality is not always true. Am I on the right directio nto solve this problem?Any hint/suggestion is welcome!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Clearly $\\limsup_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_k}{k} \\le \\sup_n \\frac{a_n}{n}$ . Fix $n \\ge 1$ . For $k \\ge 1$ , write $k = nq+r$ for $0 \\le r \\le n-1$ . Then $\\frac{a_k}{k} = \\frac{a_{nq+r}}{nq+r} \\ge \\frac{a_{nq}}{nq+r} \\ge \\frac{qa_n}{qn+r}$ . So, $\\liminf_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_k}{k} \\ge \\frac{a_n}{n}$ . It follows that $\\liminf_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_k}{k} \\ge \\sup_n \\frac{a_n}{n}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question. Let's read through the question carefully.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the sequence (a_n / n) converges. The given conditions are:\n\n1. The sequence (a_n) is positive and monotonically increasing.\n2. It satisfies the inequality a_{n*m} >= n*a_m for all natural numbers n, m.\n3. The supremum of {a_n / n} is finite (i.e., less than infinity).\n\nThe user's task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem sections as per the example. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- (a_n) is a positive sequence.\n- (a_n) is monotonically increasing.\n- For all natural numbers n and m, a_{n*m} >= n*a_m.\n- The supremum of the set {a_n / n | n in N} is finite (i.e., sup exists and is less than infinity).\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that (a_n / n) converges.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is separate. Let me check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions that (a_n) is positive and increasing, which are two separate conditions. Then the functional inequality, and the boundedness of the sequence a_n/n. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement itself is to prove convergence of the sequence a_n/n. \n\nNow, let me check if there's any additional information in the user's attempt that might affect the assumptions. The user mentions trying to use properties with m=1, leading to a_n >= n*a_1, but this is derived from the given inequality when m=1. So the original assumptions are as listed above.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have four assumptions and the problem statement.",
