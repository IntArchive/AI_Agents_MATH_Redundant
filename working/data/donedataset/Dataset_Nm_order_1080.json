    "Content": "I recently came across this problem Q1 Show that $\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\underbrace{{\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}}}_{n \\textrm{ times  }} = 3$ After trying it I looked at the solution from that book which was very ingenious but it was incomplete because it assumed that the limit already exists. So my question is Q2 Prove that the sequence$$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}},\\cdots,\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}$$ converges. Though I only need solution for Q2 , if you happen to know any complete solution for Q1 it would be a great help . If the solution from that book is required I can post it but it is not complete as I mentioned. Edit : I see that a similar question was asked before on this site but it was not proved that limit should exist.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to parse the original question and identify the key components. The problem is about proving the convergence of a specific sequence. The sequence is described with nested square roots, each term adding another layer. The original question mentions Q1 and Q2, but the user is focusing on Q2, which is proving convergence. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the sequence is defined recursively with each term involving an additional nested square root. The main assumptions here would relate to the structure of the sequence. Each term in the sequence is built by adding another square root layer, starting from the innermost part, which is n√1, but as n increases, each subsequent term adds another layer. However, the problem is to show that this entire sequence converges.\n\nWait, the sequence is constructed as follows: the first term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)), the second is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1))), the third is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + 4*sqrt(1)))), and so on. Each term adds another square root inside. The question is to prove convergence of this sequence. So the assumptions would be about how each term is structured. Each term a_n is defined by starting with n√1 and then nesting the previous terms. However, in the problem statement, the user hasn't provided explicit recursion, but the sequence is given as a sequence of such nested radicals. \n\nAssumptions should be each condition applied to one object. Let me think: each term of the sequence is defined by a nested radical starting from 1 and adding up to k√1 where k starts from 2 up to n+1? Wait, the first term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)), which is for n=2? Or maybe n=1? Let's check: the terms are listed as sqrt(1+2√1), sqrt(1+2√1+3√1), etc. Wait, actually, looking at the sequence:\n\nThe first term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)),\n\nSecond term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1))),\n\nThird term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + 4*sqrt(1)))),\n\nSo each term adds another layer. The nth term (assuming starting from n=1) would have n+1 layers? For example, the first term (n=1) has 2 layers: 2*sqrt(1) inside the sqrt(1 + ...). The second term (n=2) has 3 layers: 3*sqrt(1) inside the 2*sqrt(...), which is inside the outer sqrt(1 + ...). Wait, maybe the index is a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps the nth term has n square roots. Let me count:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)) → two square roots: the outer one and the inner sqrt(1).\n\nWait, no. The inner sqrt(1) is just √1, which is 1. So the first term is sqrt(1 + 2*1) = sqrt(3). The second term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*1)) = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(4)) = sqrt(1 + 2*2) = sqrt(5). The third term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + 4*1))) = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(5)))... Hmm, perhaps the pattern is more complex. But the key point is that each term adds another coefficient inside the nested radicals.\n\nBut for the assumptions, perhaps the main structure is that each term in the sequence is of the form sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + n*sqrt(1)...))). Therefore, each term is built recursively. However, the problem statement is to prove that the sequence converges. The original problem mentions that the limit was assumed to exist in the solution provided, but the user wants to prove convergence (Q2). \n\nSo the assumptions here would relate to the structure of each term in the sequence. Each term is a nested radical starting from 1 and with coefficients increasing from 2 up to k, where k is the term's position plus 1? Wait, the first term has 2, the second has 2 and 3, the third has 2,3,4, etc. So the nth term has coefficients 2,3,...,n+1? So the general term a_n is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))). Therefore, each term adds one more layer. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- For each natural number n, the nth term of the sequence is defined as sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))).\n\nBut wait, the problem states the sequence as:\n\nsqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1}}, sqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1 + 3sqrt{1}}}, sqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1 + 3sqrt{1 + 4sqrt{1}}}}, ..., sqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1 + 3sqrt{1 + 4sqrt{1 + ... + n sqrt{1}}}}}\n\nWait, in the last term, it's up to n sqrt{1}. So maybe the nth term is when the innermost term is n sqrt{1}. Let's check:\n\nFirst term: sqrt{1 + 2 sqrt{1}} → innermost is 2 sqrt{1}?\n\nWait, no. The structure is: each term starts with sqrt{1 + 2*sqrt{...}, where inside the ... is another sqrt{1 + 3*sqrt{...}}, and so on until the innermost is k*sqrt{1}. \n\nLooking at the first term: sqrt{1 + 2*sqrt{1}}. The innermost is 2*sqrt{1}.\n\nSecond term: sqrt{1 + 2*sqrt{1 + 3*sqrt{1}}} → innermost is 3*sqrt{1}.\n\nThird term: sqrt{1 + 2*sqrt{1 + 3*sqrt{1 + 4*sqrt{1}}}} → innermost is 4*sqrt{1}.\n\nSo the nth term would have the innermost term being (n+1)*sqrt{1}? For the first term, n=1: innermost is 2*sqrt{1}; n=2: innermost is 3*sqrt{1}, etc. So generalizing, the nth term has the innermost term as (n+1)*sqrt{1}, and each subsequent layer adds the next lower integer coefficient. So the nth term is:\n\nsqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...)))\n\nTherefore, each term a_n is defined with coefficients from 2 up to (n+1), each nested inside the previous.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions needed would be:\n\n- The sequence is defined such that each term a_n is a nested radical of the form sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))).\n\nBut the problem is to prove convergence. So perhaps another assumption is that each term is well-defined (i.e., all expressions under the square roots are non-negative). Since all terms inside are positive, this is automatically satisfied, but maybe it's an implicit assumption.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each natural number n ≥ 1, the nth term of the sequence is defined recursively as a_n = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))).\n\nBut maybe breaking it down into multiple assumptions. However, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumption is the definition of the sequence. Since the problem is about proving convergence, the structure of the sequence is the main assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach term of the sequence is constructed by nesting square roots starting from 1 and adding coefficients incrementally.\n\nBut that's vague. To be precise, following the example's style, which lists each assumption line by line. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the sequence is defined in a specific way. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined as a_1 = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)),\n\na_2 = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1))),\n\na_3 = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + 4*sqrt(1)))),\n\nand so on, with each subsequent term adding an additional nested term of the form (k+1)*sqrt(1) inside the previous term's innermost square root.\n\nBut this is a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nFor each natural number n ≥ 1, the nth term a_n is defined by the nested radical expression starting with sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))).\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition. So maybe list each step of the recursive definition as a separate assumption. However, that might not be necessary. Alternatively, since the problem statement already describes the sequence structure, the main assumption is the definition of the sequence. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined by a_n = sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))) for each natural number n ≥ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were two separate conditions. Here, it's one assumption about the structure of the sequence. However, maybe the problem has more assumptions. For example, the terms are real numbers (since square roots of non-negative numbers are real), which is necessary for convergence in real numbers. But perhaps that's implicit. The user might not need to state that, but according to the example, if there are specific conditions, they should be listed. But in the original problem, the only explicit assumption is the structure of the sequence. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption section would list the definition of the sequence's terms. Since the problem is to prove convergence, the key assumption is how each term is built. Therefore, the assumption is the recursive definition of the sequence. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the assumption is about the structure of each a_n. So I think the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach term of the sequence is a nested radical of the form sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (k+1)*sqrt(1)...))) where k ranges from 1 to n.\n\nBut this is still a bit vague. Let me check the original problem's exact wording:\n\n\"Prove that the sequence$$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}},\\cdots,\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}$$ converges.\"\n\nSo the nth term is the last expression, which ends with n√1. Wait, in the last term, the innermost part is n√1, but in the previous terms, for example, the first term is sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1)), which ends with 2*sqrt(1). The second term ends with 3*sqrt(1). Wait, no. Let's parse the last term:\n\nsqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1 + 3sqrt{1 + 4sqrt{1 + ... + n sqrt{1}}}}}\n\nSo for the nth term, the innermost radical is n*sqrt{1}, then moving outward, it's (n-1)*sqrt{1 + ...}, etc. Wait, no. Let's take n=3:\n\nThird term: sqrt{1 + 2sqrt{1 + 3sqrt{1 + 4sqrt{1}}}}\n\nWait, that's n=3? Because the innermost is 4sqrt{1}, which is (3+1)sqrt{1}. Wait, so for the nth term, the coefficients go up to (n+1). Therefore, the nth term has coefficients 2,3,...,n+1. So the assumption is that for each n ≥ 1, the nth term a_n is defined as sqrt(1 + 2*sqrt(1 + 3*sqrt(1 + ... + (n+1)*sqrt(1)...))).\n\nBut to list assumptions line by line, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- For each natural number n ≥ 1, the nth term of the sequence is defined recursively with k from 2 to n+1 nested inside square roots.\n\nBut this is vague. Alternatively, since the sequence is explicitly written out in the problem statement, maybe the assumption is just the structure given. However, the example's assumptions were listed as separate lines. Given that, perhaps the correct way is to state the structure of each term as the assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- The first term is √(1 + 2√1),\n\n- The second term is √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√1)),\n\n- The third term is √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√1))),\n\n- Each subsequent term adds an additional nested term of the form (k+1)√(1 + ...) inside the previous term's innermost square root.\n\nBut this is multiple lines, each describing a property. However, in the example, the assumptions were two separate conditions on n. Here, the sequence's definition is a single assumption, but broken down into how each term is built. However, the user's example had two separate assumptions, each on the same object (n). In this problem, the sequence's definition is a single assumption but may involve multiple parts. However, the user's format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps the main assumption is the recursive definition of the sequence. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach term of the sequence is constructed by adding an additional nested square root with the next integer coefficient.\n\nBut this is too vague. Alternatively, the exact structure is necessary. Given the problem statement, the sequence is defined as:\n\na_1 = √(1 + 2√1)\n\na_2 = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√1))\n\na_3 = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√1)))\n\n...\n\na_n = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√(1 + ... + (n+1)√1...)))\n\nTherefore, the assumption is the recursive structure of the sequence. To list this as assumptions, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The first term of the sequence is √(1 + 2√1),\n\n- Each subsequent term adds an additional nested square root term of the form (k)√(1 + (k+1)√(...)), where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut this is still two lines. Alternatively, since the problem explicitly writes out the sequence, perhaps the assumption is the general form of the nth term. However, the example's assumptions were two separate conditions on n. Here, the key is that the sequence is defined with each term having an additional nested radical. Therefore, the assumption section should capture the recursive definition. But how to split it into line-by-line assumptions?\n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumption is simply the definition of the sequence as given. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined by $$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}},\\cdots,\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}.$$\n\nBut this is the problem statement itself. However, in the example, the assumption was more about the conditions on n rather than the structure of A(n). Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the example might have been edited. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That might be an error in the example, or perhaps it's a hypothetical. But regardless, following the user's instructions, we need to list all assumptions from the problem. However, in the current problem, the user's question is to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange post, which includes Q2: proving convergence of the sequence. The original problem's assumptions are the definition of the sequence. The user hasn't added any extra conditions, so the assumption is simply how the sequence is defined. Therefore, the correct assumption should be the definition of the sequence's terms as given. Since the problem is to prove convergence, the main assumption is the structure of the sequence. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach term of the sequence is a nested radical of the form $$\\sqrt{1 + 2\\sqrt{1 + 3\\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{1 + \\cdots + n\\sqrt{1}}}}.$$\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the sequence converges.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's sequence is up to n√1 in the nth term. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sequence is listed as:\n\nsqrt{1+2√1}, sqrt{1+2√1+3√1}, sqrt{1+2√1+3√1+4√1}}},..., sqrt{1+2√1+3√1+4√1+...+n√1}}}\n\nWait, actually, in the last term, it's up to n√1. Let me check the LaTeX code given in the problem:\n\n$$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}},\\cdots,\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}$$\n\nSo the nth term (the last one) is sqrt{1 + 2*sqrt{1 + 3*sqrt{1 + 4*sqrt{1 + ... + n*sqrt{1}}}}}\n\nTherefore, each term a_n corresponds to a nested radical starting with 1 + 2*sqrt(...), with the innermost term being n*sqrt{1}.\n\nSo for the nth term, the innermost radical is n*sqrt{1}, then moving outwards, it's (n-1)*sqrt{1 + n*sqrt{1}}, etc. So the nth term is built by starting from the innermost n*sqrt{1} and working outward. Therefore, the sequence is defined such that the nth term has n layers of square roots, starting from k = n down to 2. \n\nThus, the assumption is:\n\nFor each natural number n ≥ 1, the nth term a_n is defined as a nested radical where the innermost term is n*sqrt{1}, and each subsequent layer outward adds a coefficient decreasing by 1 until reaching 2.\n\nBut to break this into line-by-line assumptions per the example:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence is defined such that each term a_n contains n nested square roots.\n\n- The innermost term of a_n is n*sqrt{1}.\n\n- Each subsequent layer outward adds a coefficient one less than the previous layer.\n\nBut this might be more structured. However, perhaps it's better to capture the recursive nature. Alternatively, since the problem states the sequence explicitly, the main assumption is the given structure. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- For n = 1: a_1 = √(1 + 2√1),\n\n- For n = 2: a_2 = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√1)),\n\n- For n = 3: a_3 = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√1))),\n\n- ...\n\n- For each n, a_n = √(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√(1 + ... + n√1...))).\n\nBut this is multiple lines, but according to the example, each assumption should be on a single line. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach term a_n of the sequence is defined recursively starting from the innermost term n√1 and building outward with coefficients decreasing by 1.\n\nBut this is still a bit vague. Alternatively, to follow the example's style where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The sequence is defined by nested radicals with increasing coefficients.\n\n- The innermost radical for the nth term is n√1.\n\n- Each layer outward from the innermost term has a coefficient one less than the layer inside.\n\nBut I think this is overcomplicating. The problem statement clearly defines the sequence, so the main assumption is the definition provided. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption section should state the structure of the sequence as given. Since the example had two assumptions (though possibly incorrect), here the assumption is the definition of the sequence. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe sequence is defined by $$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}},\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}},\\cdots,\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}.$$\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the sequence converges.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumption should list the conditions, so here the sequence's definition is the main assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is defined as $$\\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1}}, \\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1}}}, \\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1}}}}, \\ldots, \\sqrt{1+2\\sqrt{1+3\\sqrt{1+4\\sqrt{1+\\cdots+n\\sqrt{1}}}}}.$$\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence converges.",
