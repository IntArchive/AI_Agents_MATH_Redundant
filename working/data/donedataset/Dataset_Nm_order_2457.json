    "Content": "Consider the set $$A=\\{2^n+3^n\\mid n\\in \\mathbb Z^+\\}$$ Prove that the set of primes (call it $P$ ) dividing $A$ is infinite. (A prime is in $P$ iff it divides at least one element of $A$ ). The \"natural\" way to do this is to assume the set $P=\\{p_1,...,p_k\\}$ is finite, and then construct an $n_o$ such that $2^{n_o}+3^{n_o}$ is divisible by a new prime not in $P$ . But I tried a lot of things like $p_1p_2...p_k$ but they don't work. How am I supposed to approach this? By the way this is just a special case of a more general problem. It replaces $2^n+3^n$ by $ab^n+cd^n$ . But I think that solving the special case is enough to get an idea how to solve the general one.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Regarding the general case of $$f(n) = ab^n + cd^n \\tag{1}\\label{eq1B}$$ then with $a$ , $b$ , $c$ and $d$ being positive integers, the only requirement for the set of primes which divide $f(n)$ for at least one positive integer $n$ to be infinite in size is that $b \\neq d$ . As your comment indicates, the AoPS thread Exponential function with finitely many primes deals with this problem. However, most of the solutions there have various mistakes, in particular inappropriately assuming certain coprime conditions. The following is a rearrangement, with some more details and other changes, of what's in post #6 . First, as it states, and I've explained in more detail in my earlier answer , we can WLOG assume $$\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(b,d) = 1 \\tag{2}\\label{eq2B}$$ Next, let $P$ be the set of primes which divide at least one of the values of the sequence $f(n)$ in \\eqref{eq1B}. Assume $P$ has a finite number of elements, with $Q$ being the product of those primes which don't divide either $b$ or $d$ . Note that $Q \\gt 1$ since for any primes $p \\in P$ which divide either $b$ or $d$ , then the coprime conditions mean they divide $a$ (if $p \\mid d$ ) or $c$ (if $p \\mid b$ ). However, say for $p \\mid d$ so $p \\mid a$ , then for large enough $n$ we have $\\nu_p(ab^n +cd^n) = \\nu_p(a)$ , i.e., it's bounded above. This is also true for the other case. However, since $f(n)$ is unbounded, then it must have other prime factors, i.e., those used in producing the product $Q$ . Thus, for some integer $k \\ge 1$ , primes $q_i \\in P$ , any integer $j \\ge 1$ , and using Euler's totient function , we have $$Q = \\prod_{i=1}^{k}q_i, \\;\\; M = Q^{a+c}, \\;\\; s_{j} = j\\varphi(M) \\tag{3}\\label{eq3B}$$ Thus, we also get $$f(s_j) = ab^{s_j}+cd^{s_j} \\equiv a + c \\pmod{M} \\tag{4}\\label{eq4B}$$ This means there's an integer $r$ where $f(s_j) = a + c + rM$ . The $a+c$ exponent used for $M$ in \\eqref{eq3B} means, for any $q_i$ prime factor of $Q$ , that $\\nu_{q_i}(rM) \\ge a + c$ . Since $\\nu_{q_i}(a+c) \\lt a + c$ , then $\\nu_{q_i}(a+c) \\lt \\nu_{q_i}(rM)$ , we get $$\\nu_{q_i}(f(s_j)) = \\nu_{q_i}(a+c) \\tag{5}\\label{eq5B}$$ which means its bounded. This, along with the explanation earlier that the value of $\\nu_p(f(n))$ for any prime $p \\in P$ and $p \\mid bd$ is also bounded, means the possible values of $f(s_j)$ are bounded, contradicting that $f(s_j)$ actually grows without bound. This contradiction means the finite assumption is incorrect, i.e., there are infinitely many elements in the set of primes $P$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the set of primes dividing at least one element of the set A = {2^n + 3^n | n ∈ ℤ⁺} is infinite. The user mentioned trying an approach similar to Euclid's proof for the infinitude of primes, where you assume a finite set of primes and then construct a number that contradicts that assumption. But they ran into issues when using the product of those primes. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recap Euclid's proof. He supposed there were finitely many primes, multiplied them all together, added 1, and showed that this new number must have a prime factor not in the original list. Here, instead of numbers of the form p1*p2*...*pk + 1, we need to consider numbers of the form 2^n + 3^n. The challenge is to find an n such that 2^n + 3^n is not divisible by any of the primes in the supposed finite set P.\n\nSuppose P is finite, say P = {p1, p2, ..., pk}. Each prime pi in P divides at least one term 2^{ni} + 3^{ni} for some ni. The idea is to construct an n0 such that 2^{n0} + 3^{n0} is not divisible by any pi in P, thereby introducing a new prime.\n\nOne possible approach is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) or properties of exponents modulo primes. Let's consider that for each prime pi, the expression 2^n + 3^n ≡ 0 mod pi. Let's analyze this congruence.\n\nIf pi divides 2^n + 3^n, then 2^n ≡ -3^n mod pi. Let's divide both sides by 2^n (assuming pi ≠ 2,3, but we can handle those separately). Then 1 ≡ (- (3/2))^n mod pi. Let’s denote r = (-3/2) mod pi. Then r^n ≡ 1 mod pi. This implies that the multiplicative order of r modulo pi divides n. So for each pi, there exists some order di such that r^di ≡ 1 mod pi. Therefore, if we choose n such that n ≡ 0 mod di for each pi, then r^n ≡ 1 mod pi, leading to 2^n + 3^n ≡ 0 mod pi. But we need to avoid this. Wait, actually, we want to choose an n such that 2^n + 3^n is NOT divisible by any pi. Hmm, so maybe instead of making n divisible by di, we need to choose n such that for each pi, 2^n + 3^n ≡ something not 0 mod pi.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a similar approach to the proof that there are infinitely many primes in arithmetic progressions. Or maybe using the fact that if there were only finitely many primes dividing any 2^n + 3^n, then there would be a periodicity modulo those primes, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: consider the primes dividing 2^n + 3^n. If there are only finitely many such primes, then for some large n, 2^n + 3^n must be a product of these primes. But 2^n + 3^n grows exponentially, whereas the product of a fixed set of primes raised to exponents grows only polynomially, so this might lead to a contradiction. However, this is vague. Let's think more concretely.\n\nLet me consider specific primes. For example, if p is a prime that divides 2^n + 3^n, then 2^n ≡ -3^n mod p. Suppose p ≠ 2,3. Then, dividing both sides by 3^n, we get (2/3)^n ≡ -1 mod p. Let’s set a = 2/3 mod p. Then a^n ≡ -1 mod p. Squaring both sides, we get a^{2n} ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, the multiplicative order of a modulo p divides 2n but not n. This implies that the order of a is even, and divides 2n but not n. Therefore, the order of a must be 2d where d divides n. Therefore, for each such p, the order of 2/3 modulo p is even, and there's some relationship with n.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix a prime p and look at the exponents n for which p divides 2^n + 3^n, these n might form an arithmetic progression or have some periodicity. If there are only finitely many primes in P, then for each prime pi in P, there's a period di such that pi divides 2^{n} + 3^{n} whenever n ≡ some residue mod di. Then, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists some n0 such that n0 ≡ desired residues mod each di, making 2^{n0} + 3^{n0} not divisible by any pi. But how to formalize this?\n\nWait, let's suppose P is finite. For each prime pi in P, except possibly 2 and 3, there exists exponents where pi divides 2^n + 3^n. Let’s exclude 2 and 3 for a moment. For each pi ≠ 2,3, the equation 2^n ≡ -3^n mod pi implies (2/3)^n ≡ -1 mod pi. Let’s let’s denote a = 2/3 mod pi. Then a^n ≡ -1 mod pi. If a has order d modulo pi, then a^d ≡ 1 mod pi. So a^n ≡ -1 mod pi implies that a^{2n} ≡ 1 mod pi, so d divides 2n. Also, since a^n ≡ -1, d does not divide n, so the order d must be even, and the exponent n must satisfy n ≡ d/2 mod d. Therefore, for each such pi, the exponents n where pi divides 2^n + 3^n are precisely those n ≡ d/2 mod d, where d is the order of a modulo pi. Thus, if we can find an n0 that is not congruent to d_i/2 mod d_i for any pi in P, then 2^{n0} + 3^{n0} would not be divisible by any pi in P. But since P is finite, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to construct such an n0. For each pi, pick a residue class mod d_i that's different from d_i/2. Then, there exists some n0 that satisfies all these congruences. Hence, 2^{n0} + 3^{n0} is not divisible by any pi in P, which means it must have a new prime divisor not in P, contradicting the finiteness of P.\n\nHowever, we need to handle primes 2 and 3 separately. Let’s check:\n\nFor p=2: 2^n + 3^n. Since 3 is odd, 3^n is odd, so 2^n is even if n ≥1. So 2^n is even, 3^n is odd, so their sum is even + odd = odd. So 2 cannot divide 2^n + 3^n for any n ≥1. Therefore, 2 is not in P.\n\nFor p=3: Similarly, 2^n mod 3 cycles every 2: 2^1=2 mod3, 2^2=1 mod3, 2^3=2 mod3, etc. 3^n ≡0 mod3. So 2^n +0 ≡2^n mod3. This is 2 when n is odd, 1 when n is even. So 3 divides 2^n +3^n iff 2^n ≡0 mod3, which never happens. So 3 is also not in P.\n\nTherefore, P does not include 2 and 3. So all primes in P are greater than 3.\n\nThus, returning to the argument: assuming P is finite, we can construct an n0 such that 2^{n0} +3^{n0} is not divisible by any primes in P, which would imply it has a prime divisor not in P, contradicting P being the set of all such primes. Therefore, P must be infinite.\n\nBut how exactly to construct n0? Let's formalize this.\n\nFor each prime pi in P, we have that pi divides 2^{n} +3^{n} if and only if n ≡ k_i mod d_i, where d_i is twice the order of (2/3) modulo pi. Then, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can choose n0 such that n0 ≡ not k_i mod d_i for each i. Therefore, 2^{n0} +3^{n0} is not divisible by any pi in P. Hence, it must be divisible by a prime not in P, which contradicts the assumption that P contains all such primes.\n\nTherefore, the set P must be infinite.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use a theorem in number theory that states that if a and b are coprime, then the sequence a^n + b^n has infinitely many prime divisors. But since the user wants to use an elementary approach similar to Euclid's proof, the above method should work.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps using Zsigmondy's theorem. Zsigmondy's theorem states that for integers a > b > 0, coprime, the number a^n + b^n has a prime factor that does not divide a^k + b^k for any k < n, with some exceptions. If this applies here, then for a=3, b=2, coprime, then for each n, 3^n +2^n has a primitive prime divisor, except for some small n. If there are infinitely many n where 3^n +2^n has a primitive prime divisor, then P is infinite. However, Zsigmondy's theorem might require n ≥3 or something, but even if there are exceptions, infinitely many n would still give primitive primes, making P infinite. But the user might not be familiar with Zsigmondy's theorem, and the original problem suggests an elementary approach, so perhaps the earlier method is better.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n1. Assume P is finite, containing primes p1, p2, ..., pk (all >3).\n2. For each pi, determine the exponents n where pi divides 2^n +3^n. These n satisfy n ≡ k_i mod d_i for some d_i.\n3. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find n0 not in any of these congruence classes, ensuring 2^{n0} +3^{n0} is not divisible by any pi.\n4. Conclude 2^{n0} +3^{n0} has a new prime divisor, contradicting P's finiteness.\n\nThis should form the basis of the proof. Now, structuring the answer according to the required format.",
