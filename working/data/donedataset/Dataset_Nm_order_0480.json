    "Content": "Let $R$ be a ring. According to this MO question , the modules $M \\in R\\text{-Mod}$ such that $\\text{Hom}(M, -)$ preserves all filtered colimits (the compact objects ) are precisely the finitely-presented modules. Where can I find a proof of this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is easy enough to prove directly: For the direction finitely presented $\\implies$ compact , one can easily\nprove it by hand, and there is also the following somewhat slicker argument: For any module $M$ and any filtered direct limit $N = \\varinjlim_i N_i$,\nthere is a natural transformation $\\varinjlim_i Hom(M,N_i) \\to Hom(M,N).$\nThis is certainly an isomorphism when $M = R$ (because it then reduces\nto the original equality $\\varinjlim_i N_i = N$), and hence when $M = R^n$\nfor some $n \\geq 0$, because both functors $\\varinjlim_i Hom(\\text{--},N_i)$\nand $Hom(\\text{--},N)$ commute with finite direct sums. Since filtered direct limits are exact, both functors are also right\nexact. Now if $M$ is finitely presented, choose a presentation $R^m \\to R^n \\to M \\to 0,$ and apply both functors to it.  By what has already been said together with\nthe five lemma, we see that $\\varinjlim_i Hom(M,N_i) \\to Hom(N,M)$ is an isomorphism. For the other directon, suppose that $M$ is compact.\nLike any module, $M$ can be written as a filtered direct limit of finitely presented modules $M_i$.  Thus $Hom(M,M) = Hom(M,\\varinjlim_i M_i)\n= \\varinjlim_i Hom(M,M_i)$\n(the last equality following by compactness).  In particular, the identity\n$M \\to M$ can be factored through the map $M_i \\to M$ for some sufficiently\nlarge $i$.  Thus the map $M_i \\to M$ can be split, and so $M$ is a direct summand of the finitely presented module $M_i$.   Consequently, $M$ is itself finitely presented. A related fact, mentioned in the excerpt quoted by Math Gems: If we restrict to filtered direct limits with injective transition maps\n(diret unions in the language of the excerpt quoted by Math Gems), then we similarly find, using the fact that any module can be written as the filtered union of its finitely generated submodules, that finitely generated modules \nare precisely  those $M$ for which $Hom(M,\\text{--})$ commutes with filtered direct limits having injective transition maps. Added in response to the OP's questions below: If $A \\to B$ is a morphism of rings with $1$, then \n$M \\mapsto Hom_A(B,M)$ (Homs of left $A$-modules, and $Hom_A(B,M)$\nbeing endowed with the left $B$-module structure coming from the right\n$B$-module structure on $B$) is a right adjoint to the forgetful functor\nfrom left $B$-modules to left $A$-modules.   This shows that formation\nof colimits commutes with this forgetful functor. Alternatively, one can check by hand that the formula for filtered direct limits in $R$-mods is the same as in abelian groups.  (Just use the fact that direct sums, kernels, and cokernels are the same.) Also, any finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is of the form $R^n/N$ for some submodule $N$.  We may write $N = \\varinjlim_i N_i$ as the direct limit of its\nf.g. submodules.  Then $M = \\varinjlim_i R^n/N_i$ is the filtered direct limit\nof f.p. modules.  Since any module is the direct limit of its f.g. submodules,\nwe see that it is also the filtered direct limit of f.p. modules.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about compact objects in R-Mod being finitely presented modules. The user wants assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition on one object. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem. The question states that in R-Mod, the compact objects (those modules M for which Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits) are exactly the finitely presented modules. The user is asking for a reference to a proof of this fact.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be about the properties that define a compact object and the characterization of finitely presented modules. Let me break them down:\n\n1. R is a ring.\n2. M is an object in R-Mod (the category of R-modules).\n3. Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (i.e., M is a compact object).\n\nThe problem is to show that such M are precisely the finitely presented modules. So the problem statement is to prove that M being compact is equivalent to M being finitely presented.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"the modules M in R-Mod such that Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (the compact objects) are precisely the finitely-presented modules.\" So the key is to map each assumption properly. Let me check the example given by the user. In the example, they listed assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- M is an R-module.\n- Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (compactness).\n- M is finitely presented.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that compact objects are exactly the finitely presented ones. So maybe the assumptions are just the general context: R is a ring, M is in R-Mod. The problem is to prove that M is compact (Hom(M,-) preserves filtered colimits) if and only if M is finitely presented. But according to the user's example, the assumptions list conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example seems off. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user's formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7? Wait, no, the example provided by the user might have been a mistake. Wait, let me check again. The example original problem states: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong, but I shouldn't follow that. However, the user wants the assumptions to be each line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. R is a ring.\n2. M is an object in R-Mod.\n3. Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (i.e., M is a compact object).\n4. M is a finitely presented module.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that 3 and 4 are equivalent. So perhaps the assumptions are just the general context, and the problem is the equivalence. But according to the user's example, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer (from the original problem's \"for every integer n\") but also added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. However, maybe the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. But in the current problem, the user is asking for where to find the proof that the compact objects are the finitely presented modules. So the problem is to prove that in R-Mod, the compact objects (those M where Hom(M,-) preserves filtered colimits) are exactly the finitely presented modules. So the assumptions here would be the general setup: R is a ring, M is in R-Mod, and the problem is the equivalence. But according to the user's instructions, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a ring.\n- M is an object in R-Mod.\n- Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits.\n- M is a finitely presented R-module.\n\nBut no, the problem is to show that the third condition (compactness) is equivalent to the fourth (finitely presented). So maybe the assumptions are the general context, and the problem is to show the equivalence. Wait, the original problem is \"the modules M ∈ R-Mod such that Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (the compact objects) are precisely the finitely-presented modules. Where can I find a proof of this?\" So the problem is to show that for M in R-Mod, M is compact (Hom(M,-) preserves filtered colimits) iff M is finitely presented. So the assumptions would be the general setup:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- M is a module in R-Mod.\n\nThe problem is to prove that M is a compact object in R-Mod (i.e., Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits) if and only if M is a finitely presented module.\n\nBut according to the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that in the problem, when there are conditions, split them into assumptions. For the current problem, since it's a characterization, maybe the assumptions are just the general context (R is a ring, M is in R-Mod), and the problem is the equivalence. But the user's example added assumptions that weren't in the original problem. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, and the user wants to list all assumptions given in the problem. The original problem here says \"Let R be a ring. According to this MO question, the modules M in R-Mod such that Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (the compact objects) are precisely the finitely-presented modules. Where can I find a proof of this?\" So the problem is under the assumption that R is a ring, and M is an R-module. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- M is a module in R-Mod.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that M is compact (Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits) if and only if M is finitely presented.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which in the original problem the divisibility by 7 wasn't mentioned. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to structure the problem as the original assumptions, but in that example, there's a mistake. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem, the correct way is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a ring.\n- M is a module in R-Mod.\n- Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits (i.e., M is a compact object).\n- M is a finitely presented R-module.\n\nProblem: Prove that the modules M ∈ R-Mod such that Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits are precisely the finitely-presented modules.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show equivalence between being compact and finitely presented, so the assumptions should not list both conditions. Instead, the problem is to show that each implies the other. Therefore, the assumptions should be the general context (R is a ring, M is in R-Mod), and the problem is the equivalence. However, according to the user's example, perhaps the assumptions should list each condition given in the problem. But the problem here is a characterization, so maybe the correct approach is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a ring.\n- M is a module in R-Mod.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a compact object (i.e., Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits) if and only if M is a finitely presented module.\n\nBut the user's example listed specific conditions even when the original problem had a universal quantifier. Given the confusion from the example, but following the instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps here:\n\nAssumptions:\n- R is a ring.\n- M is an object in R-Mod.\n- Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits.\n- M is finitely presented.\n\nProblem: Prove that Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits if and only if M is finitely presented.\n\nBut that seems redundant because the problem is to show the equivalence, so the assumptions shouldn't list both conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the general ones (R is a ring, M is in R-Mod), and the problem is the equivalence. But the user's example added specific conditions. Maybe in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption that n is an integer, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. But in the example, the formatted problem incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example, and I should focus on the current problem. \n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- M is a module in R-Mod.\n\nProblem: Prove that M is a compact object (i.e., Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits) if and only if M is finitely presented.\n\nBut the user's example included specific conditions even when the original problem had a universal statement, but perhaps the user's example was incorrect. To adhere to the user's format, perhaps the assumptions are the general context, and the problem is the equivalence. However, the original problem states \"the modules M in R-Mod such that...\" so the problem is to show that the set of M with Hom(M,-) preserving filtered colimits equals the set of finitely presented M. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- M is an object in R-Mod.\n\nProblem: Prove that the modules M ∈ R-Mod for which Hom(M, -) preserves all filtered colimits are precisely the finitely-presented modules.\n\nThus, the assumptions are just the general setup, and the problem is the characterization.",
