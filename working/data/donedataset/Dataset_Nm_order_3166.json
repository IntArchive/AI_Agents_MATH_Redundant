    "AcceptedAnswer": "Attention [2016-11-20]: This answer is not correct as it is based upon a wrong assumption\n\\begin{align*}\nx^\\color{blue}{m}\\left|f(x)-\\zeta_m x\\right.\\qquad\\qquad m>1\n\\end{align*}\ninstead of\n\\begin{align*}\nx^\\color{blue}{2}\\left|f(x)-\\zeta_m x\\right.\\qquad\\qquad m>1\n\\end{align*} I have offered a bounty for compensation in order to support a correct answer to OPs question. Let $m>1$ be a positive integer and $f(x)$ a polynomial with complex coefficients and degree $n\\geq m$. We denote with $\\zeta_m$  the following $m$-th root of unity $$\\zeta_m=\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}\\right)$$ Claim: The following is valid for $m>1$ \\begin{align*}\nx^m\\left|f(x)-\\zeta_m x\\right.\\qquad\\implies\\qquad x^{m+1}\\left|f^{(m)}-x\\right.\\tag{1}\n\\end{align*} with \n  \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m)}(x)&:=f^{(m-1)}\\left(f(x)\\right)\\qquad m>1\\\\\nf^{(1)}(x)&:=f(x)\\\\\nf^{(0)}(x)&:=x\\\\\n\\end{align*} We introduce some more settings for convenience. Since $x^m|f(x)-\\zeta_m x$ there is a polynomial\n$$q(x)=\\sum_{j=0}^{n-m}a_jx^j$$ of degree $n-m$ with\n\\begin{align*}\nx^mq(x)&=f(x)-\\zeta_m x\\\\\n\\text{resp.}\\qquad\\qquad\\\\\nf(x)&=x^mq(x)+\\zeta_m  x\\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} Approach: The idea is to repeatedly apply (2) and so reduce $m$ in $f^{(m)}$ until we see that (1) is valid. In order to keep the calculation manageable we will consequently simplify expressions modulo $x^{m+1}$. We do not go the shortest way, but add some intermediate steps to easier see what is going on and to motivate the claim (9) which is central for proving the answer. Step: $m\\rightarrow (m-1)$ We obtain\n  \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m)}(x)-x&=f^{(m-1)}\\left(f(x)\\right)-x\\\\\n&=f^{(m-1)}\\left(x^mq(x)+\\zeta_m  x\\right)-x\\tag{3}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-1)}\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m  x\\right)-x&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{4}\\\\\n\\end{align*} Comment: In (3) we substitute the RHS of (2) for $f(x)$. In (4) we note that \n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=x^mq(x)+\\zeta_m  x\\\\\n&=x^m\\left(a_0+a_1x+\\cdots+a_{n-m}x^{n-m}\\right)+\\zeta_m\\\\\n&\\equiv x^m(a_0)+\\zeta_m&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\n\\end{align*}\nThis behaviour is also valid, when we consider compositions of $f$. This will become more obvious when we calculate the next steps. Step: $(m-1)\\rightarrow (m-2)$ We obtain from (4) \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m)}&(x)-x\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-2)}\\left(f\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m  x\\right)\\right)-x&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-2)}\\left(\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x\\right)^mq\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m  x\\right)\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\quad +\\left.\\zeta_m\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m  x\\right)\\right)-x&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{5}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-2)}\\left(x^m q\\left(x^m a_0+\\zeta_m x\\right)+\\zeta_m x^m _0+\\zeta_m^2 x\\right)-x&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{6}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-2)}\\left(x^m a_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2 x\\right)-x&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{7}\\\\\n\\end{align*} Comment: In (5) we note the only contribution of $\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x\\right)^m\\pmod{x^{m+1}}$ is $\\zeta_m^m x^m$ and since $\\zeta_m^m=1$ we get $x^m$. In (6) we note the only contribution of $x^mq\\left(x^m a_0+\\zeta_m x\\right)\\pmod{x^{m+1}}$ is the constant part $a_0$ of $q$ multiplied with $x^m$. Observation: When looking at (4) and (7) we might see a pattern, but to be sure we add one step more. Step: $(m-2)\\rightarrow (m-3)$ We obtain from (7) and continue in the same way as in the step before\n  \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m)}&(x)-x\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-3)}\\left(f\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-3)}\\left(\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)^mq\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\quad\\quad +\\left.\\zeta_m\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-3)}\\left(x^m q\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&\\qquad +\\zeta_m\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2  x\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ \\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-3)}\\left(x^m a_0+\\zeta_m x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^2 x^m a_0+\\zeta_m^3 x\\right)-x\\qquad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{8}\\\\\n\\end{align*} We see from (4),(7) and (8) a pattern which we will prove next. In fact we could start the answer with the next step. Step: $(m-k)\\rightarrow (m-k-1)$ We show the following is valid for $1\\leq k \\leq m-1$:\n  \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m-k)}&\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{k+1} x\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{9}\n\\end{align*} We obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nf^{(m-k)}&\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(f\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)^mq\\left(xa_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\quad +\\left.\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(x^mq\\left(xa_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\quad+\\left(\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(x^ma_0\n+\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^k x\\right)\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-k-1)}\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{k+1} x\\right)&\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nand the claim follows. Putting all together With the help of (9) we can show OPs  claim (1). We obtain\n  \\begin{align*}\nf^{(m)}&(x)-x\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(m-1)}\\left(x^ma_0+\\zeta_m  x\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ \\ \\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{10}\\\\\n&\\equiv f^{(1)}\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{11}\\\\\n&\\equiv \\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)^m\nq\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\quad+\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)-x\\qquad\\quad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{12}\\\\\n&\\equiv x^m q\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\quad+\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)-x\\qquad\\quad\\ \\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{13}\\\\\n&\\equiv x^m a_0+\\zeta_m\\left(a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-2} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m-1} x\\right)-x\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\\\\n&\\equiv a_0 x^m\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\zeta_m^j+\\zeta_m^{m} x-x\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\ \\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{14}\\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\pmod{x^{m+1}}\\tag{15}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n  and the claim follows. Comment: In (10) we apply the result  (4) of the first step to derive $f^{(m-1)}$ from $f^{(m)}$. In (11) we apply the main result (9) $m-2$ times to reduce $f^{(m-1)}$ to $f^{(1)}=f$. In (12) we apply (2), the representation $f(x)=x^mq(x)+\\zeta_m x$. In (13) to (14) we do simplifications $\\pmod{x^{m+1}}$ similarly to the steps before. In (15) we note $\\zeta_m^m=1$ so that $\\zeta_m^{m} x-x=0$ and we also use\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\zeta_m^j=\\frac{1-\\zeta_m^{m}}{1-\\zeta_m}=0\n\\end{align*}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is from Math Stack Exchange with the title: \"prove this $x^{m+1}|f^{(m)}(x)-x$\". The question states:\n\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial with complex coefficients such that\n$$x^2 | f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} \\cdot x$$\nwhere $m > 1$ is a given positive integer. Define\n$$f^{(1)}(x) = f(x), \\quad f^{(2)}(x) = f(f(x)), \\quad f^{(3)}(x) = f(f(f(x))), \\quad \\cdots, \\quad f^{(m)}(x) = f(f^{(m-1)}(x)).$$\nShow that\n$$x^{m+1} | f^{(m)}(x) - x.$$\n\nThe user tried induction but didn't succeed. My task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem sections as per the example given.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The example lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break down the original problem's conditions:\n\n1. The function $f(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients. So that's an assumption about $f(x)$ being a polynomial over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n2. The next condition is $x^2$ divides $f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} x$. So this is another assumption about $f(x)$, specifically its form modulo $x^2$.\n\n3. The integer $m$ is given as a positive integer greater than 1. So $m > 1$ is an assumption on $m$.\n\n4. The definition of $f^{(k)}(x)$ as the $k$-th iterate of $f$ is given. This is more about notation than an assumption, but perhaps needs to be included as part of the problem setup. Wait, in the example, the assumptions included the divisibility by 7 as a separate line, but here, maybe the conditions on $f(x)$ are the main assumptions. The definitions of the iterates might not be assumptions but rather part of the problem statement. Let me check the original example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem mentioned that $n$ is an integer, and then the user had two assumptions: $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem as given, it was \"for every integer $n$\", so maybe the example added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption? Wait, no. Wait the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but the original problem didn't state n being an integer as a separate condition but as part of the universal quantifier. Hmm, perhaps the example's formatting is to list all the conditions given in the problem. Let me re-examine.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not \"for n divisible by 7\". Wait, the user example might have a mistake. Wait, looking back: the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show how to structure, even if the example is wrong. So maybe in their example, they considered that the problem as stated actually requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Anyway, perhaps I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says: Let f(x) be a polynomial with complex coefficients such that x^2 divides f(x) - e^{2πi/m} x, where m >1 is a given positive integer. Then defines f^{(k)}(x) as the k-th iterate. The goal is to show x^{m+1} divides f^{(m)}(x) - x.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f(x) is a polynomial with complex coefficients.\n\n2. x² divides f(x) - e^{2πi/m} x. So f(x) ≡ e^{2πi/m} x mod x².\n\n3. m is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\n4. The iterates are defined as f^{(1)}(x) = f(x), f^{(k)}(x) = f(f^{(k-1)}(x)).\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are about the objects and their properties. So for the problem at hand, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is a polynomial with complex coefficients.\n\n- x² divides f(x) - e^{2πi/m} x.\n\n- m is a positive integer, m >1.\n\nThe definitions of the iterates are part of the problem setup but perhaps not assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the current problem, even though m is given as a positive integer >1, that's an assumption. So each assumption line by line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients,\n$x^2$ divides $f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} x$,\n$m$ is a positive integer,\n$m > 1$.\n\nProblem: Show that $x^{m+1}$ divides $f^{(m)}(x) - x$.\n\nBut wait, the problem defines $f^{(m)}(x)$ as the m-th iterate. Do I need to include that in assumptions? Or is it part of the problem's notation? Since the problem defines the iterates, but in the example, they didn't include the definition of A(n) in the assumptions. So perhaps the definitions are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. The assumptions are the conditions given on f(x) and m. So the above four points: f is a polynomial over C, f(x) ≡ e^{2πi/m} x mod x², m is a positive integer, m >1.\n\nWait, the problem says \"where m>1 is a given positive integer\". So m is given and fixed, with m >1. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. $f(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients.\n\n2. $x^2$ divides $f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} x$.\n\n3. $m$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nThese are the key assumptions. The definitions of the iterates are part of the problem setup but not assumptions per se. So I should list the three assumptions as above. Then the problem is to show that x^{m+1} divides f^{(m)}(x) -x.\n\nBut let me check if there's anything else. For example, is the polynomial f(x) of a certain degree? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the only assumption on f(x) is that it's a polynomial (degree unspecified) with complex coefficients, and satisfies the divisibility condition.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$f(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients,\n$x^2$ divides $f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} x$,\n$m$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$x^{m+1} \\mid f^{(m)}(x) - x.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"show that $$x^{m+1}|f^{(m)}(x)-x$$ I try to use mathematical induction to prove.But there is no proof\". So the problem is to show the divisibility by x^{m+1} after m iterations.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients,\n$x^2$ divides $f(x) - e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{m}} x$,\n$m$ is a positive integer greater than 1.\nProblem:\nShow that $$x^{m+1} \\mid f^{(m)}(x) - x.$$\n###\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. The first line is about f(x) being a polynomial over C, the second about the divisibility condition, and the third about m. The problem is to show the higher divisibility after m iterations.",
