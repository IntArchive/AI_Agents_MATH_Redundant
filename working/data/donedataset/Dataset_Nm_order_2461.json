    "Content": "Let $M_i$ be a arbitrary colection of $A$ -modules and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $A$ . I want to show that $$S^{-1}\\left(\\bigoplus_i M_i\\right)\\cong \\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i$$ as $A$ -modules and as $S^{-1}A$ -modules. I know how to explicitly write an isomorphism between them but I want to do it using the universal properties to understand better how they work. Here's what I've done: Let $M=\\bigoplus_i M_i$ with the canonical injections $\\iota_i:M_i\\to M$ . Also let $\\Phi:M\\to S^{-1}M$ be the canonical morphism associated with the localization. Composing these morphisms we get $$\\Phi\\circ\\iota_i:M_i\\to S^{-1}M.$$ By the universal property of the localization, we obtain a unique morphism $$\\overline{\\Phi\\circ\\iota_i}:S^{-1}M_i\\to S^{-1}M$$ such that $\\overline{\\Phi\\circ\\iota_i}\\circ\\Phi_i=\\Phi\\circ\\iota_i$ , where $\\Phi_i:M_i\\to S^{-1}M_i$ is the localization morphism. Finally, by the universal property of the coproduct we obtain a morphism $$\\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i\\to S^{-1}M.$$ I think this morphism might be the desired isomorphism but I don't know how to prove it. (Maybe a good idea would be to find its inverse but for it I need some kind of morphism $M\\to M_i$ , which is not available when the direct sum is infinite.) Also, I know there are a couple questions here about similar things but they do either the explicit isomorphism or the finite case. Edit: after @GreginGre commentaries, I have a morphism $S^{-1}M\\to S^{-1}M_i$ but I don't know neither how to obtain a morphism $S^{-1}M\\to\\bigoplus S^{-1}M_i$ (since this is the wrong side for the universal property of coproducts) nor how to show that these two morphisms are inverses of each other.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Similarly as you have constructed the map, you can show that $\\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i$ satisfies the universal property of $S^{-1}\\bigoplus_i M$ , which is just the combination of the universal property of localisation and the direct sum. This can be done 'by hand', which usually involves a large diagram, or as follows, if you are confident with functors: We have the following sequence of natural equivalences of functors from the category of $S^{-1}A$ -modules to the category of sets, given by various universal properties: $$\\begin{align*}\n\\hom_{S^{-1}A}(S^{-1}M,-) &= \\hom_A(M,-|_A)\\\\\n&=\\prod\\nolimits_i \\hom_A(M_i,-|_A)\\\\\n&=\\prod\\nolimits_i \\hom_{S^{-1}A}(S^{-1}M_i,-|_A)\\\\\n&= \\hom_{S^{-1}A}\\left(\\bigoplus\\nolimits_i S^{-1}M_i,-\\right),\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$ where $-|_A$ means restriction of the $S^{-1}$ -module structure to $A$ . This is the same as saying that their universal properties are equivalent; formally, one should invoke the Yoneda Lemma to conclude the claim. Tracing through the isomorphisms also tells you how to construct the isomorphisms if you plug in $S^{-1}M$ or $\\bigoplus\\nolimits_i S^{-1}M_i$ and look where the identity goes. And this shows that the map you've constructed is indeed the natural isomorphism.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Localization commutes with arbitrary direct sums\". The user wants to show that the localization of a direct sum of A-modules is isomorphic to the direct sum of their localizations, both as A-modules and S⁻¹A-modules. They tried using universal properties but got stuck in proving the isomorphism, especially in constructing the inverse morphism.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The user mentions \"Let M_i be an arbitrary collection of A-modules\". So, M_i are A-modules, and the collection is arbitrary (could be any set, possibly infinite).\n2. \"S is a multiplicative subset of A\": This is another assumption. S is a multiplicative subset of the ring A.\n3. The problem involves showing an isomorphism between S⁻¹(⊕M_i) and ⊕S⁻¹M_i as both A-modules and S⁻¹A-modules. However, since the user is focusing on using universal properties, the key assumptions are about the structure of the modules and the properties of localization.\n\nWait, the original problem statement might have more details. Let me check again.\n\nThe user starts by stating M_i is an arbitrary collection of A-modules and S is a multiplicative subset of A. They want to show the isomorphism. Then they talk about using universal properties, mentioning the direct sum M with injections ι_i, and the localization morphism Φ: M → S⁻¹M. They compose these to get maps from M_i to S⁻¹M, then use the universal property of localization to get maps from S⁻¹M_i to S⁻¹M, and then the universal property of coproducts to get a morphism from ⊕S⁻¹M_i to S⁻¹M. They suspect this is an isomorphism but struggle with proving it, especially finding an inverse.\n\nSo the main assumptions are:\n\n- M_i is an arbitrary collection of A-modules.\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n- The direct sum M = ⊕M_i with canonical injections ι_i.\n- The localization morphisms Φ: M → S⁻¹M and Φ_i: M_i → S⁻¹M_i.\n\nBut when listing assumptions, they should be conditions or properties. The key assumptions here are the structures involved: the direct sum of modules, multiplicative subset, and the canonical morphisms. However, the problem is to show the isomorphism, so the assumptions are the given data.\n\nSo, translating into the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n- The collection of M_i is arbitrary (possibly infinite).\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n- The direct sum ⊕M_i is considered with canonical injections.\n- Localization is taken with respect to S.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the objects (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about modules and localization, so the assumptions are the given structures. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the user might have added another assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: Assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, it's for every integer n, so the formatted problem seems to have added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which is not present. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user intended to filter out some conditions? Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That would actually restrict the problem. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. But regardless, the user wants to apply this format to the new problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, \"Localization commutes with arbitrary direct sums\", the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\n- The direct sum is taken over an arbitrary collection (so possibly infinite).\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question is to show S⁻¹(⊕M_i) ≅ ⊕S⁻¹M_i as A-modules and S⁻¹A-modules. So the assumptions are the given structures: A is a ring, S is a multiplicative subset, M_i are A-modules, and we take their direct sum and localize.\n\nBut in the example, the user might have included conditions that were not in the original problem. However, since the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", that seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example is wrong, and the user actually wants to extract the explicit assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user didn't mention any specific conditions on S or M_i other than they are a multiplicative subset and A-modules. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\n- The direct sum ⊕M_i is considered.\n\nBut the problem is to show the isomorphism between S⁻¹(⊕M_i) and ⊕S⁻¹M_i.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated by the user includes that they want to show this isomorphism as both A-modules and S⁻¹A-modules. However, localization S⁻¹M is naturally an S⁻¹A-module. So maybe the key assumptions are about the structures, but not additional conditions.\n\nSo following the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in reality, the original problem's assumption is only \"n is an integer\", and the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. So the example might have a mistake where they added an extra assumption. Therefore, perhaps in the current problem, we should only list the assumptions given in the problem statement, not inferred.\n\nIn the current problem, the user starts with \"Let M_i be an arbitrary collection of A-modules and S a multiplicative subset of A.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- M_i is an arbitrary collection of A-modules.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\n- The direct sum ⊕M_i is considered.\n\nSo each of these would be separate lines in the assumption list. Then the problem is to show the isomorphism.\n\nWait, but \"arbitrary collection\" could be considered as one assumption. Also, the direct sum is part of the problem setup. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- {M_i} is an arbitrary collection of A-modules.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\nProblem: Show that S⁻¹(⊕M_i) ≅ ⊕S⁻¹M_i as A-modules and as S⁻¹A-modules.\n\nSo that's probably the correct way. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user might have incorrectly added an assumption. But since the example is given, I have to follow its structure, even if it's flawed. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- The collection of M_i is arbitrary.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\nBut the user also mentions that they are using the universal properties, so perhaps the assumptions include the existence of canonical morphisms? No, those are part of the problem's structure, not assumptions. The key given data are the modules, the multiplicative subset, and the direct sum.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- The collection of M_i is arbitrary.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\nProblem: Show that $$S^{-1}\\left(\\bigoplus_i M_i\\right)\\cong \\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i$$ as A-modules and as S⁻¹A-modules.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"I want to show that...\". The key is to list all assumptions explicitly. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- The collection of M_i is arbitrary (possibly infinite).\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\n- The direct sum ⊕M_i is considered with its canonical injections.\n\n- Localization is taken with respect to S.\n\nWait, but \"direct sum with canonical injections\" is part of the structure, but not an assumption. The problem is to construct the isomorphism using universal properties. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the objects (n being integer, etc.), not about the methods used. So probably, the assumptions here are about the modules and the multiplicative set.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- Each M_i is an A-module.\n\n- S is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\n- The collection of M_i is arbitrary.\n\nThus, three assumptions. Each is a separate line.\n\nThe problem is to show the isomorphism between the localization of the direct sum and the direct sum of localizations, as both A-modules and S⁻¹A-modules.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nEach $M_i$ is an $A$-module,\n$S$ is a multiplicative subset of $A$,\nThe collection of $M_i$ is arbitrary.\nProblem:\nShow that $$S^{-1}\\left(\\bigoplus_i M_i\\right)\\cong \\bigoplus_i S^{-1}M_i$$ as $A$-modules and as $S^{-1}A$-modules.\n###",
