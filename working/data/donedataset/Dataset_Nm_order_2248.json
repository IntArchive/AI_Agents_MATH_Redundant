    "Content": "There is a result that if $p_n$ is the $n$th prime, then $p_n\\sim n\\log n$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$. I wonder: Is it a direct consequence of the prime number theorem $\\pi(x)\\sim x/\\log x$? The theorem says that there are approximately $n/\\log n$ primes less than or equal to $n$. So there are approximately $n$ primes less than or equal to $n\\log n$. So $p_n$ is approximately $n\\log n$. But I'm having trouble turning this into a formal argument. We have $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\dfrac{\\pi(n)\\log n}{n}=1$. How would it show that $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\dfrac{p_n}{n\\log n}=1$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The proposals are $p_n\\sim n\\log n$ and $\\pi(x)\\sim \\frac{x}{\\log x}$. Consider: $$p_{\\pi(x)}\\sim \\pi(x)\\log\\pi(x)\\sim\\frac{x}{\\log x}\\log\\left(\\frac{x}{\\log x}\\right)=\\frac{x}{\\log x}\\left(\\log x-\\log\\log x\\right)\\sim x$$ and $$\\pi(p_n)\\sim\\pi(n\\log n)\\sim\\frac{n\\log n}{\\log(n\\log n)}=\\frac{n\\log n}{\\log n+\\log\\log n}\\sim n$$ Try formailizing this (giving more meaning to $\\sim$) to show that $p_{({.})}$ and $\\pi({.})$ are asymptotic inverses. To formalize more: Let $f(x)=\\frac{x}{\\log{x}}$ and $g(x)=x\\log{x}$. Then \n$$\\frac{f(g(x))}{x}=\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{x\\log{x}}{\\log(x\\log{x})}=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\log\\log x}{\\log x}}\\xrightarrow{x\\to\\infty}1$$ And $$\\frac{g(f(x))}{x}=\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{x}{\\log{x}}\\log\\left(\\frac{x}{\\log{x}}\\right)=\\frac{1-\\frac{\\log\\log x}{\\log x}}{1}\\xrightarrow{x\\to\\infty}1$$ And so for large $x$, $f(g(x))\\sim x$ and $g(f(x))\\sim x$, where $A\\sim B$ means that their ratio approaches $1$. All this is to say that $f$ and $g$ are asymptotic inverses. So if we start with the premise that the $n$th prime number $p_n$ is approximately $g(n)$ (in the same \"ratio approaches 1\" sense), and then define $\\pi(x)$ as the inverse concept (the number of primes less than a given $x$), then $\\pi(x)$ is approximately $f(x)$ (again in that sense).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the result that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n as n approaches infinity is a direct consequence of the prime number theorem (PNT), which states that the number of primes less than x, π(x), is approximately x / log x. They tried to reason through it by noting that if π(n) ~ n / log n, then there are roughly n primes less than or equal to n log n. Therefore, p_n should be around n log n. However, they're struggling to formalize this argument and specifically want to show that the limit of p_n / (n log n) as n approaches infinity is 1, given the PNT.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here are the given conditions or theorems that the problem relies on. The prime number theorem is stated as π(x) ~ x / log x, which is given. The problem is to show that p_n ~ n log n, i.e., that the nth prime is asymptotic to n log n, using the PNT.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included a specific condition applied to one object. Here, the main assumption is the prime number theorem, which relates π(x) and x / log x. The user is asking if p_n ~ n log n follows directly from PNT. So the assumption should list the PNT as given. Also, the problem is to prove that p_n is asymptotic to n log n, given that π(x) ~ x / log x.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The user mentions that they have the limit lim_{n→∞} π(n) log n / n = 1, which is another way of stating the PNT for x = n. Then they want to show lim_{n→∞} p_n / (n log n) = 1. So the key is to invert the relationship between π(x) and p_n. Since π(p_n) = n, because the nth prime is p_n, and π(x) counts primes up to x, so π(p_n) = n. Therefore, if we can express p_n in terms of the inverse function of π(x), then using the asymptotic of π(x) we can find the asymptotic of p_n.\n\nThe problem is to show that p_n ~ n log n given π(x) ~ x / log x. So the assumption is the prime number theorem, and the problem is to prove the asymptotic for p_n. The user is trying to convert the approximation of π(x) into an approximation for its inverse function, which is p_n.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format: the assumptions should list the given conditions. Here, the main assumption is the prime number theorem applied to π(x). The problem is to prove that p_n is asymptotic to n log n. Therefore, the assumption would be that π(x) is asymptotic to x / log x as x approaches infinity. The problem is to show that p_n is asymptotic to n log n as n approaches infinity.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. In this case, the prime number theorem is one assumption about the asymptotic behavior of π(x). Are there any other assumptions? The user mentions that p_n is the nth prime, which is a definition, not an assumption. So the only assumption needed here is the prime number theorem for π(x).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: π(x) ~ x / log x as x approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that p_n ~ n log n as n approaches infinity, where p_n denotes the nth prime.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumption was split into two lines, each addressing one property. Here, the PNT is one statement. So maybe just one line. However, if the user's original problem had any other implicit assumptions, like n being a positive integer, but that's standard. However, the example given included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, we should also include that n is a positive integer. Although in the original problem statement, the user says \"the nth prime\", so n is a positive integer by definition. But maybe to be thorough, list that as an assumption.\n\nBut the example given for the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, the user hasn't specified any divisibility conditions. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. π(x) is asymptotic to x / log x as x approaches infinity.\n\n2. p_n is the nth prime number.\n\nBut wait, the second is more of a definition. The problem is to show the asymptotic for p_n given the asymptotic for π(x). So perhaps the only assumption needed is the PNT. The fact that p_n is the nth prime is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the user starts by stating that p_n is the nth prime and refers to the PNT. Therefore, in the assumptions, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nπ(x) ~ x / log x as x → ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that p_n ~ n log n as n → ∞.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in the original problem here, the user is not imposing any conditions on n except that it's a positive integer (since we're talking about the nth prime). But in the problem statement, they mention n approaching infinity, so n is a positive integer going to infinity. However, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" even though that's part of the problem's premise. So perhaps here, to follow the example's structure, we should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nπ(x) ~ x / log x as x → ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that p_n ~ n log n as n → ∞.\n\nBut in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So in this case, the original problem says \"the nth prime\", so n is a positive integer. So maybe it's redundant, but to follow the example's style, perhaps include \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption.\n\nHowever, the key assumption here is the prime number theorem. The fact that n is a positive integer is part of the problem's context. But given the example, maybe it's better to include both. Let me check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the user in the example made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, the original example might have had a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems incorrect, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. So maybe the example is flawed. Therefore, maybe in this case, the user wants us to list all the assumptions inherent in the problem, even if they are part of the definitions.\n\nBut given that, in the current problem, the key assumption is the prime number theorem. The rest is part of the problem setup. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is only the PNT. The fact that n is a positive integer is part of the problem's context, but not an assumption per se. However, to match the example's style, maybe include \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. But I need to check the original question.\n\nOriginal question states: \"Estimate of nth prime. There is a result that p_n ~ n log n as n→infty. I wonder: Is it a direct consequence of PNT π(x) ~x/log x? [...] How would it show that lim_{n→infty} p_n/(n log n)=1?\"\n\nSo the problem is to show that the nth prime p_n satisfies p_n ~n log n, given that π(x) ~x/log x. The user is asking if this follows directly. So the key assumption is π(x) ~x/log x. The rest is the problem to be proven. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption should be π(x) ~x/log x as x→infty. The problem is to prove p_n ~n log n as n→infty.\n\nThus, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nπ(x) ~ x / log x as x → ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p_n ~ n log n as n → ∞.\n\nBut according to the example, if the original problem had a \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\", perhaps here, since p_n is the nth prime, n is inherently a positive integer. So maybe include that as an assumption? But in the example, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and an additional condition. However, in the current problem, there are no additional conditions on n beyond it being a positive integer (which is part of the definition of p_n). Therefore, if we follow the example's style, perhaps list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. But in the example, the additional assumption was \"n is divisible by 7\", which was not in the original problem's statement. Wait, that seems contradictory. The original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n must be divisible by 7. That changes the problem. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, I should not take the example as a strict guide but rather the instructions given.\n\nThe user says: \"All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The prime number theorem: π(x) is asymptotic to x / log x as x approaches infinity.\n\nThat's the main given. Additionally, the problem is about the nth prime, so p_n is defined as the nth prime, which implies n is a positive integer. However, since the problem is about asymptotic behavior as n approaches infinity, n being a positive integer is part of the problem's context. But according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, to adhere to the example's format, perhaps here include:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nπ(x) ~ x / log x as x → ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that p_n ~ n log n as n → ∞.\n\nBut in the original question, the user didn't state any restriction on n other than it being an index for the prime, which is inherently a positive integer. So including \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption might be redundant but follows the example's structure. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption \"n is an integer\". But the problem here is about p_n, the nth prime, which by definition requires n to be a positive integer. So perhaps it's better to include it as an assumption for clarity, even if it's inherent.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nπ(x) ~ x / log x as x → ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p_n ~ n log n as n → ∞.\n\nYes, this seems to fit the structure where each assumption is one line, addressing one property. The first line establishes that n is a positive integer (the index of the prime), and the second line states the prime number theorem as the given condition. The problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence for p_n.",
