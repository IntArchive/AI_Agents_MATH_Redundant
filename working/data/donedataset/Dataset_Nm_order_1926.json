    "Content": "I'm trying to understand an alternative proof of the idea that if $E$ is a dense subset of a metric space $X$, and $f\\colon E\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ has a uniform continuous extension to $X$. I think I know how to do this using Cauchy sequences, but there is this suggested alternative. For each $p\\in X$, let $V_n(p)$ be the set of $q\\in E$ such that $d(p,q)<\\frac{1}{n}$. Then prove that the intersections of the closures\n$$\nA=\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty\\overline{f(V_n(p))}\n$$\nconsists of a single point, $g(p)$, and so $g$ is the desired continuous extension of $f$. Why is this intersection a single point, and why is $g$ continuous? This is what I did so far. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, for given $\\epsilon>0$, there is $\\delta>0$ such that $\\text{diam }f(V)<\\epsilon$ whenever $\\text{diam }V<\\delta$. Since $V_n(p)$ has diameter at most $\\frac{2}{n}$, taking $n>2/\\delta$ would imply \n$$\n\\text{diam }f(V_n(p))=\\text{diam }\\overline{f(V_n(p))}<\\epsilon\n$$\nSo I think $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\text{diam }\\overline{f(V_n(p))}=0$, which would imply $A$ consists of at most one point. I noticed that the closures form a descending sequence of closed sets, but I couldn't tell if they are bounded since $X$ is an arbitrary metric space, in order to conclude that the intersection is nonempty, and hence a single point. Lastly, why is $g$ continuous at points $p\\in X\\setminus E$? I was trying to think of an argument with sequences converging to $p$ since $p$ is a limit point of $E$, but got stumping on how to show $g$ is actually continuous. Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I had a lot of help on this question in chat from users Srivatsan and t.b. the other day. I tried my best to write up what was said as an answer here. Notice that the sets $\\overline{f(V_n(p))}\\supseteq\\overline{f(V_{n+1}(p))}\\supseteq\\cdots$ form a nested sequence of closed sets. Moreover, let $\\epsilon>0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $d(p,q) < \\delta$ implies $d(f(p),f(q))<\\epsilon$ for $p,q\\in E$. Taking $n$ large enough so that $\\frac{2}{n}<\\delta$, then for $q,r\\in V_n(p)$,\n$$\nd(q,r)<d(q,p)+d(p,r)<\\frac{2}{n}<\\delta\n$$\nso $d(f(q),f(r))<\\epsilon$. Thus $f(V_n(p))$ is bounded in $\\mathbb{R}$, so $\\overline{f(V_n(p))}$ is bounded as well. Hence for large enough $n$ the sets form a compact nested sequence. Since $V_n(p)$ has diameter at most $\\frac{2}{n}$, taking $n>2/\\delta$ would imply \n$$\n\\operatorname{diam } f(V_n(p))=\\operatorname{diam }\\overline{f(V_n(p))}<\\epsilon\n$$\nSo $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\operatorname{diam }\\overline{f(V_n(p))}=0$, and thus their intersection consists of a single point. Also, since $\\operatorname{diam }f(V_n(p))\\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$, and so by choosing points arbitrarily close to $p$, their images under $g$ are arbitrarily close to $g(p)$. (To be more explicit, letting $\\delta$ be small enough such that for $x,y\\in E$, then $d(x,y)<2\\delta$ implies $d(f(x),f(y))<\\epsilon/3$, choose $n$ large enough that $\\frac{1}{n}<\\delta$, and thus for any $x,y\\in V_n(p)$, $d(x,y)<2/n<2\\delta$, so $\\operatorname{diam }f(V_n(p))<2\\epsilon/3$, so $d(f(x),g(p))<2\\epsilon/3$. Note also that this can be done for any $p$.) I contend that $g$ is uniformly continuous. Let $\\epsilon>0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $d(r,s)<\\delta$ implies $d(f(r),f(s))<\\epsilon/3$. Now let $p,q\\in X$ be any points such that $d(p,q)<\\delta/3$. By the above reasoning, choose $n$ large enough so that $n>\\frac{3}{\\delta}$, and both $d(g(r),g(p))<\\epsilon/3$ and $d(g(s),g(q))<\\epsilon/3$ for $r\\in V_n(p)$ and $s\\in V_n(q)$. Also, \n$$\nd(r,s)<d(r,p)+d(p,q)+d(q,s)<\\delta\n$$\nso $d(f(r),f(s))=d(g(r),g(s))<\\epsilon/3$. By the triangle inequality, $d(g(p),g(q))<\\epsilon$, so $g$ is uniformly continuous, and thus continuous on $X$, and of course $g|_E=f$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading through the original question carefully. The user is asking about extending a uniformly continuous function from a dense subset to the entire metric space. The key points here are:\n\n1. E is a dense subset of a metric space X.\n2. f: E → ℝ is uniformly continuous.\n3. They want to prove that f has a uniformly continuous extension to X using a specific method involving the intersections of closures of images of neighborhoods.\n\nThe user's approach involves defining V_n(p) as the set of points in E within distance 1/n of p, then looking at the intersection of the closures of f(V_n(p)). They showed that the diameter of these closures goes to zero, implying the intersection is at most a single point. However, they are stuck on why the intersection is non-empty (hence exactly one point) and why the resulting function g is continuous, especially at points not in E.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- E is a dense subset of the metric space X. (Assumption about E and X)\n- f is a function from E to ℝ. (Assumption about f's domain and codomain)\n- f is uniformly continuous on E. (Assumption about f's continuity)\n- For each p in X, V_n(p) is defined as the set of q in E with d(p,q) < 1/n. (Defining V_n(p))\n- A is the intersection of the closures of f(V_n(p)) for all n. (Defining A)\n- The problem is to prove that A is a singleton {g(p)}, and that g is a uniformly continuous extension of f. (The actual problem)\n\nWait, the user also mentions that they need to show g is continuous. But in the problem statement, the user says \"why is this intersection a single point, and why is g continuous?\" So the problem has two parts: showing the intersection is a single point (i.e., A is a singleton) and showing g is continuous. Also, note that the original problem is about continuous extension, but the user refers to uniform continuity. Wait, the title says \"uniformly continuous function\" and the problem mentions \"uniform continuous extension\". But in the problem statement as structured, maybe the key is that the extension is uniformly continuous? Wait, but the user's question is about proving that the intersection A is a singleton and why g is continuous, but the original problem is to show that f has a uniformly continuous extension. However, the user's specific questions are about the singleton intersection and continuity of g. So perhaps the problem, as per the user's specific questions, is to show that A is a singleton (hence defining g(p)) and that g is continuous.\n\nBut the original problem's title mentions \"continuous extension\", but the user is following an approach where they define g via the intersection. So the problem as structured by the user is: given E dense in X, f uniformly continuous on E, then for each p in X, define A as the intersection of closures of f(V_n(p)), show that A is a singleton, hence defining g(p), and then show that g is continuous (and uniformly continuous? The original problem states \"uniform continuous extension\", so maybe the continuity here is uniform? But the user's specific question is about continuity of g at points in X\\E.)\n\nWait, the original problem the user is trying to solve is: if E is dense in X and f: E → ℝ is uniformly continuous, then f has a uniformly continuous extension to X. The alternative approach suggested is to define g(p) via the intersection A, and the user needs to show that A is a singleton (so g is well-defined) and that g is continuous (and presumably uniformly continuous). However, the user's specific questions are: why is A a single point (which they partially solved by showing the diameter goes to zero, but need to confirm non-emptiness), and why is g continuous. So the problem, as per the user's focus, is to show that for each p in X, the intersection A is a singleton (thus defining g(p)), and that g is continuous. Additionally, since the original aim is a uniformly continuous extension, perhaps the problem also includes showing g is uniformly continuous, but the user's specific problem stops at continuity. Hmm.\n\nBut the user writes: \"prove that the intersections of the closures [...] consists of a single point, g(p), and so g is the desired continuous extension of f.\" So the problem is two parts: showing A is a singleton, hence defining g(p), and showing g is continuous. The original problem's desired conclusion is that g is the continuous extension. However, in the original problem statement, the user says \"uniformly continuous extension\", so maybe continuity here is part of the process, and uniform continuity is another step. But the user's specific questions are about why A is a single point and why g is continuous. So the problem to structure is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- E is a dense subset of a metric space X.\n- f: E → ℝ is uniformly continuous.\n- For each p ∈ X, V_n(p) is the set of q ∈ E with d(p, q) < 1/n.\n- A = ⋂_{n=1}^∞ closure(f(V_n(p))).\n\nProblem:\nProve that A consists of a single point g(p), and that g is a continuous extension of f.\n\nWait, but in the user's problem, they already take A as defined, and need to show it's a singleton and g is continuous. So the problem is to show that for each p, A is a singleton (i.e., the intersection is non-empty and has diameter zero, hence one point) and that g is continuous. So the assumptions are E dense in X, f uniformly continuous, V_n(p) as defined, and A as the intersection. The problem is to prove A is a singleton and g is continuous.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nEach assumption should be line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a dense subset of the metric space X,\nf is a function from E to ℝ,\nf is uniformly continuous on E,\nFor each p in X, V_n(p) is the set { q ∈ E | d(p, q) < 1/n },\nA is the intersection over n ≥ 1 of the closures of f(V_n(p)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that A consists of a single point g(p), and that g is a continuous extension of f.\n\nWait, but the problem as per the user's question is more specific: why is the intersection a single point (which they partially solved by showing the diameters go to zero, but need to show non-empty) and why is g continuous. So the problem is two parts: singleton intersection and continuity of g.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove that the intersection is a singleton (hence defining g) and that g is continuous. The extension part is given that f is defined on E, and g is defined on X, so g extends f if for points in E, g(p) = f(p). The user might also need to verify that, but in their question, they didn't mention that part, focusing on the intersection being a singleton and continuity at points not in E.\n\nSo in the structured problem, the assumptions include E being dense, f uniformly continuous, V_n(p) defined as the neighborhood, and A as the intersection. The problem is to show A is a singleton (hence defining g(p)) and that g is continuous.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were:\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the example lists each assumption on a separate line. Each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is a dense subset of the metric space X.\n- f: E → ℝ is a uniformly continuous function.\n- For each p ∈ X and n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is defined as { q ∈ E | d(p, q) < 1/n }.\n- A(p) is the intersection ⋂ₙ=1^∞ closure(f(Vₙ(p))).\n\nProblem:\nProve that for each p ∈ X, A(p) consists of exactly one point g(p), and that g: X → ℝ is a continuous extension of f.\n\nBut need to check if the user's problem includes proving g is an extension. Since the user mentions \"so g is the desired continuous extension of f\", the problem includes showing that g extends f. Therefore, the problem is:\n\nProve that for each p ∈ X, the intersection A(p) is a singleton {g(p)}, that g extends f, and that g is continuous.\n\nBut the user's specific questions are about why the intersection is a singleton and why g is continuous. The extension part might be considered straightforward but necessary. However, the original problem says \"prove that the intersections [...] consists of a single point, g(p), and so g is the desired continuous extension\". So the problem as per the user's phrasing is to prove the intersection is a singleton (hence defining g) and that g is the continuous extension. Therefore, the problem should include both parts.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a dense subset of the metric space X,\nf is a function from E to ℝ,\nf is uniformly continuous on E,\nFor each p ∈ X and each n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is the set { q ∈ E | d(p, q) < 1/n },\nFor each p ∈ X, A(p) is defined as ⋂ₙ=1^∞ closure(f(Vₙ(p))).\n\nProblem:\nProve that for each p ∈ X, A(p) consists of exactly one point g(p), and that g is a continuous extension of f to X.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that A(p) is a singleton (so g(p) exists) and that g is continuous (and extends f). The original problem also mentions \"uniform continuous extension\", but the user's specific problem within this approach is about the continuity, not necessarily uniform continuity here. Wait, the user says in their question that they need to prove g is the desired continuous extension. The original problem's title mentions \"uniformly continuous function\", but the extension's continuity is what's in question here. The user's approach is about proving continuity, not necessarily uniform continuity. However, the problem as structured by the user's question is about the continuity, not uniform continuity. The user mentions they know how to do it via Cauchy sequences but are trying this alternative method.\n\nTherefore, in the problem statement, we should structure it as proving that A(p) is a singleton (hence defining g(p)) and that g is a continuous extension. The uniform continuity of the extension might be part of the original problem, but the user's specific question here is about the continuity, not uniform. So the problem is about proving continuity of g. Hence, the problem statement is as above.\n\nChecking for each assumption:\n\n- E is dense: yes.\n- f is from E to R: yes.\n- f is uniformly continuous: yes.\n- Vₙ(p) defined as points in E within 1/n of p: yes.\n- A(p) is the intersection of closures: yes.\n\nProblem: Prove A(p) is a singleton and g is continuous extension.\n\nThis seems to cover all the parts. So the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nE is a dense subset of the metric space X,\nf is a function from E to ℝ,\nf is uniformly continuous on E,\nFor each p ∈ X and n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is the set { q ∈ E | d(p, q) < 1/n },\nFor each p ∈ X, A(p) is the intersection ⋂ₙ=1^∞ closure(f(Vₙ(p))).\n\nProblem:\nProve that for each p ∈ X, A(p) consists of exactly one point g(p), and that g is a continuous extension of f to X.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal example:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. In the current case:\n\n- E is a dense subset of the metric space X.\n- f is a function from E to ℝ.\n- f is uniformly continuous on E.\n- For each p ∈ X and n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is defined as { q ∈ E | d(p, q) < 1/n }.\n- For each p ∈ X, A(p) is defined as ⋂ₙ=1^∞ closure(f(Vₙ(p))).\n\nBut in the user's problem statement, the Vₙ(p) and A are part of the problem setup, so they need to be included in the assumptions. Each of these is a separate condition applied to one object. However, \"For each p ∈ X and n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is defined as...\" can be split into two assumptions? No, it's a single definition. So each bullet is a separate assumption. Similarly, A(p) is defined as the intersection. So these are part of the assumptions given in the problem.\n\nThus, the structured problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nE is a dense subset of the metric space X,\nf is a function from E to ℝ,\nf is uniformly continuous on E,\nFor each p ∈ X and n ∈ ℕ, Vₙ(p) is the set of q ∈ E with d(p, q) < 1/n,\nFor each p ∈ X, A(p) is the intersection of the closures ⋂ₙ=1^∞ closure(f(Vₙ(p))).\nProblem:\nProve that for each p ∈ X, A(p) consists of exactly one point g(p), and that g is a continuous extension of f to X.\n###",
