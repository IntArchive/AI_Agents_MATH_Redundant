    "AcceptedAnswer": "If you know the product representation $$\\sin (\\pi z) = \\pi z \\prod_{k = 1}^\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{z^2}{k^2}\\right),\\tag{1}$$ it is rather easy. Setting $z = i$, we obtain $$\\frac{\\sin (\\pi i)}{\\pi i} = \\frac{\\sinh \\pi}{\\pi} = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(1 - \\frac{i^2}{k^2}\\right) = \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) = 2 \\prod_{k=2}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{k^2+1}{k^2}\\right).$$ On the other hand, $$\\prod_{k=2}^n \\left(\\frac{k^2-1}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac12\\cdot \\frac32\\cdot \\frac23\\cdot \\frac43 \\dotsb \\frac{n-1}{n}\\cdot \\frac{n+1}{n} = \\frac12\\cdot\\frac{n+1}{n},$$ so $$\\prod_{k=2}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{k^2-1}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac12.$$ Now divide.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, the original question is about evaluating an infinite product: the product from k=2 to infinity of (k² -1)/(k² +1), which is supposed to equal π/sinh(π). The user included their attempt using Gamma functions and asymptotic behavior to evaluate the limit. \n\nNow, I need to structure this according to the given format. The key part is the Assumption section. The example provided listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, what are the assumptions here? The product is from k=2 to infinity, so each term is (k² -1)/(k² +1). The problem is to show that this product equals π/sinh(π). The user's approach involved rewriting the terms using Gamma functions. \n\nHowever, in terms of assumptions for the problem, the problem itself doesn't state any specific conditions or constraints unless they are implied. The product is an infinite product starting at k=2. The variables here are k, which is an integer starting from 2. The problem is to evaluate the product, but the original problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the product definition. \n\nWait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption that the infinite product converges? Or perhaps the use of Gamma functions assumes knowledge of their properties? But according to the example given, assumptions are more about the problem's conditions rather than the methods used to solve it. \n\nIn the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any such conditions. The product is over integers k starting at 2. So perhaps the only assumption is that k is an integer greater than or equal to 2? But since the product is written as from k=2 to infinity, that's part of the problem statement. \n\nWait, the example included an assumption that wasn't explicitly in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that would be adding an extra condition. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect?\n\nWait, the original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's not correct because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Hmm, perhaps the example was miswritten. Because if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7 unless the original problem had that condition. Wait, the original problem's formatted version says \"assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem's statement is \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91\". So maybe there's a confusion here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the problem was supposed to have n divisible by 7 as an assumption, but the original problem didn't state that. So maybe there was an error in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, for the current problem, we need to list the assumptions of the problem. \n\nLooking at the current problem: \"How does one show that the product from k=2 to infinity of (k² -1)/(k² +1) equals π/sinhπ?\" The problem is to evaluate this infinite product. The assumptions here would be related to the conditions under which the product converges or is defined. However, the problem statement itself doesn't specify any restrictions beyond k starting at 2. \n\nIn the context of infinite products, convergence is important, but unless specified, perhaps the problem assumes that the product converges. But according to the example, assumptions are listed as separate points. Since the product is written as from k=2 to infinity, perhaps the assumption is that k is an integer greater than or equal to 2. So each term in the product is (k² -1)/(k² +1) for integer k starting at 2. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k is greater than or equal to 2.\n- The infinite product converges.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that the product equals π/sinhπ. The problem itself is the evaluation. But does the problem state any assumptions, or are they implicit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the product definition. Since the problem is presented as is, perhaps the only assumption is that the product starts at k=2 and goes to infinity. So in the assumption section, we can list:\n\n- The product is taken over integers k starting from 2.\n- The product is an infinite product.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So if the problem is about the product over k starting at 2, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k ≥ 2.\n- The infinite product converges.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state these; they are inherent to the product notation. However, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, and the user wants to list all the inherent conditions as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the correct assumption was that n is an integer (which was part of the original statement), and the user added another assumption. But that seems confusing.\n\nGiven the user's example, they included both the fact that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7 as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that case, the user made a mistake. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem here is the infinite product from k=2 to ∞ of (k² -1)/(k² +1). The objects here are the terms of the product, which are defined for each integer k starting at 2. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k is greater than or equal to 2.\n- The product is taken from k = 2 to infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more precise:\n\n- For each integer k ≥ 2, the term is (k² -1)/(k² +1).\n- The product is an infinite product.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to list each assumption on one line, each about one object. So, for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 2,\nthe product is taken over all integers k starting from 2 to infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement itself already includes \"k=2 to infinity\", so maybe the assumptions are redundant. However, following the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So, similarly, here, even though the product is from k=2 to infinity, the assumptions would list that k is an integer and k ≥ 2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is an integer,\nk is greater than or equal to 2.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{k^{2}-1}{k^{2}+1}  =\\frac{\\pi}{\\sinh \\pi}. $$\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The assumptions are that k is an integer and k starts at 2. The problem is to show the product equals π/sinhπ.\n\nThe user's attempt involved rewriting the product using Gamma functions and taking a limit, but the problem itself doesn't require those steps to be part of the assumptions. The core problem is to evaluate the infinite product under the given conditions.",
