    "Content": "Some quick notes about what I have studied so far about sequences (Note: this is an edit after I accepted the answer and realized my lack of understanding for this simple sequence): Here I am working with sequences of Real numbers, therefore, for that sequence, I defined a function $a$ , such that $$a: \\mathbb{N}\\to \\mathbb{R}$$ $$a:n  \\mapsto a(n) = a_n$$ The sequence is denoted as $\\{a_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ , such that $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ . Given sequence $\\left\\{6(-\\frac{5}{6})^n\\right\\} _{n=1}^\\infty$ Once a sequence $\\{a_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ is convergent for $L\\in\\mathbb{R}$ when $n\\to\\infty$ , therefore $$\\lim _{n\\to\\infty} a_n = L$$ this is for only if for a given $\\epsilon > 0$ , so we can find a $N_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\forall n > N_0$ we have $|a_n - L| < \\epsilon $ .\nBasically, a sequence is convergent if it tends to a Real number. On the other hand, it is divergent if it does not converge to a Real number. This is the reason why I tried to find the limit but I ended up not being able to solve it. I know that for the sequence $a_n$ , such that $a_n = 6\\left(-\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^n$ we have. $$a_n = 6\\left(-\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^n = 6 \\cdot\\dfrac{(-5)^n}{6^n} = 6^{1-n}\\cdot(-5)^n$$ According to Wolfram Alpha, $\\lim _{n\\to \\infty }(6^{1-n}(-5)^n) = 0$ and thus the sequence converges to $0$ . But I couldn't solve the limit. Wolfram solves it using exponential but it wasn't a straightforward solution for me. How can I solve $\\lim _{n\\to \\infty }(6^{1-n}(-5)^n)$ in a simpler and good way? This might be a  consequence of the first question, but how can I show that the sequence is convergent? What would be another approach?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about showing that the sequence {6*(-5/6)^n} converges to 0. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and structure the problem properly.\n\nThe sequence is defined as a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n for n starting from 1 to infinity. The user mentions that Wolfram Alpha says the limit is 0, but they want to understand how to prove it step by step. \n\nAssumptions: First, the sequence is defined for all natural numbers n. Each term of the sequence is a real number because even though there's a negative base, the exponent is an integer, so the result is real. The problem is about showing convergence to 0. \n\nWait, in the original example, they had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the sequence is defined for n in natural numbers, so n is a positive integer. That's an assumption. Also, the terms involve (-5/6)^n. The key here is the absolute value of the base, which is 5/6, a fraction between 0 and 1. When raised to the power n, as n approaches infinity, this should go to 0. But since there's a factor of 6 multiplied, maybe it's 6*(5/6)^n, but the sign alternates because of the negative. However, regardless of the sign, if the absolute value goes to 0, the sequence converges to 0. \n\nSo the assumptions would be that n is a natural number, the sequence is defined as 6*(-5/6)^n, and we need to show that the limit as n approaches infinity is 0. \n\nWait, the original problem's example listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the main assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence is defined as a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n for each natural number n.\n\nBut maybe also that we're considering the limit as n approaches infinity. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is defined by a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n for each n in the natural numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence {a_n} converges to 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the sequence {6*(-5/6)^n} from n=1 to infinity, the assumptions would include that n is a natural number (since the sequence is indexed by n starting at 1). Each term is a real number. The problem is to show the limit is 0. But the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, perhaps the key assumptions are just the definition of the sequence. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was n is an integer, but then there was an additional condition that n is divisible by 7. But in this current problem, there's no such additional condition except that n is a natural number. So maybe the assumption here is just:\n\n- n is a natural number (i.e., n ∈ ℕ).\n\nBut the problem is about the sequence a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n. So maybe another assumption is that the sequence is defined for all n ∈ ℕ. Alternatively, since the problem is as given, perhaps the key assumption is the definition of the sequence. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each natural number n, the sequence term is a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {a_n} converges to 0.\n\nBut I need to follow the example format. In the example, the user listed two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about a sequence defined for n in natural numbers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a natural number (i.e., n ∈ ℕ).\n\nBut perhaps also that the terms are real numbers. However, in the original example, they didn't list the codomain, just the conditions on n. So maybe here, the main assumption is that the sequence is defined by a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n for each n ∈ ℕ. But to break it down into line items, as per the example:\n\nAssumption:\nEach term of the sequence is defined as a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n,\nn is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ).\n\nBut the example had each assumption on a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is defined by a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n,\nn is an element of the natural numbers (n ∈ ℕ).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the sequence {a_n} converges to 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even more broken down:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each natural number n, the sequence term a_n is 6 multiplied by (-5/6) raised to the nth power.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity is 0.\n\nBut the example had each assumption as separate lines. So here, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is defined by a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n for each n ∈ ℕ.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to split into two assumptions: one about the form of a_n and another about n being a natural number. However, in the original example, the user split the assumptions into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ),\nEach term of the sequence is a_n = 6*(-5/6)^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence {a_n} converges to 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line. So the problem is correctly structured with those two assumptions and the problem statement.",
