    "Content": "The companion matrix of a monic polynomial $f \\in \\mathbb F\\left[x\\right]$ in $1$ variable $x$ over a field $\\mathbb F$ plays an important role in understanding the structure of finite dimensional $\\mathbb F[x]$ -modules. It is an important fact that the characteristic polynomial and the minimal polynomial of $C(f)$ are both equal to $f$ . This can be seen quite easily by induction on the degree of $f$ . Does anyone know a different proof of this fact? I would love to see a graph theoretic proof or a non inductive algebraic proof, but I would be happy with anything that makes it seem like more than a coincidence!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose your matrix is over a field $\\mathbb{F}$. Look at $G = \\mathbb F[x]/f$, where $f$ is your polynomial of degree $n$. Then $G$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}$, and $C(f)$ is the matrix (with respect to the basis $1,x,x^2,\\ldots,x^{n-1}$) corresponding to the linear operator $g \\mapsto x \\cdot g$. Since $f = 0$ in $G$, also $fx^i = 0$ in $G$, and so $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ such that $f(C(f)) = 0$. Moreover, any polynomial $g$ of smaller degree does not reduce to $0$ in $G$, so in particular $g(C(f))$ applied to the vector $1$ does not equal the zero vector. So $f$ is the minimal polynomial of $C(f)$. Since it has degree $n$, it must be the characteristic polynomial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the user's example. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question on Math Stack Exchange.\n\nThe original question is about the characteristic and minimal polynomials of a companion matrix. The user mentions that the companion matrix C(f) of a monic polynomial f in F[x] has both its characteristic and minimal polynomials equal to f. They want a different proof than the inductive one, maybe graph-theoretic or a non-inductive algebraic approach.\n\nSo, following the example format, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n- The companion matrix is of a monic polynomial f in F[x]. So first assumption: f is a monic polynomial in F[x].\n\n- The polynomial is in one variable x over a field F. Wait, the original says \"monic polynomial $f \\in \\mathbb{F}[x]$ in 1 variable x over a field F\". So maybe break that into two? Or is it one assumption? The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate. So here, maybe \"f is a monic polynomial in F[x]\", \"f is a polynomial in one variable x\", \"F is a field\". But wait, F[x] already denotes polynomials in x over F, so maybe \"f is a monic polynomial in F[x]\" and \"F is a field\". The fact that it's in one variable x is inherent in F[x]. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F is a field.\n- f is a monic polynomial in F[x].\n- C(f) is the companion matrix of f.\n\nWait, the companion matrix is part of the problem setup. The problem is to show that both characteristic and minimal polynomials of C(f) are equal to f. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- f is a monic polynomial in F[x].\n- C(f) denotes the companion matrix of f.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial of C(f) are both equal to f.\n\nBut the original question mentions \"different proof of this fact\" other than induction on the degree. However, in the example provided, the formatted problem included the problem statement as given, not including the request for alternative proofs. So maybe in the Problem section, we just state the problem as \"Prove that the characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial of C(f) are both equal to f.\" and the user's additional request for a different proof is part of the original question but not part of the structured problem. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem had \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" So they included the core problem, filtering out the context about induction. Similarly here, the user's problem is to prove that char poly and min poly of C(f) are f, and the original question's context about wanting a different proof is filtered out. So the Problem section should just state the mathematical problem, not the request for alternative proofs.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a field.\n- f is a monic polynomial in F[x].\n- C(f) is the companion matrix of f.\n\nProblem: Prove that the characteristic polynomial and the minimal polynomial of C(f) are both equal to f.\n\nWait, but in the example, they included the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's specific conditions. However, in this case, the original problem doesn't have any extra conditions beyond the general case. The companion matrix is defined for any monic polynomial f over a field F. So the assumptions are just the standard setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions, then the problem statement.",
