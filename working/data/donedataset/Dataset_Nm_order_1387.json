    "Content": "I'm pretty new to writing proofs. I've recently been trying to tackle proofs by induction. I'm having a hard time applying my knowledge of how induction works to other types of problems (divisibility, inequalities, etc). I've been checking out the other induction questions on this website, but they either move too fast or don't explain their reasoning behind their steps enough and I end up not being able to follow the logic. I do understand how to tackle a problem which involves a summation. \nThis is the one I just did (the classic \"little gauss\" proof): Prove $1+2+3+\\dots+n = n(n+1)/2$ I. Basis $1=(1+1)/2$ $1=1$ II. Induction Assume the expression holds for an arbitrary $n=k$ such that\n$1+2+3+\\dots+k = k(k+1)/2$ Show that the expression holds for $n=k+1$\n$1+2+3+...+n+k+(k+1) = k+1[(k+1)+1]/2$ And this is done mainly by observing that we already have a formula for 1 through k on the LHS, so the equation can be rewritten as $k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = k+1[(k+1)+1]/2$ NOTE: I believe this is using the inductive hypothesis. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, finding common denominators on the left hand side and distributing on the right, you eventually show that it's true. This (so far) has worked for every proof I've attempted that involves a summation on the left hand side. Now, I start losing it when the format changes. For example, this inequality proof I'm trying to write. I'll post what I have here: $n^2 \\ge 2n$ for all $n>1$ I. Basis $2^{2} \\ge 2(2)$ $4 \\ge 4$ II. Induction Assume the inequality holds for an arbitrary $n=k$, such that $k^2 \\ge 2(k)$ Show that the expression holds for $n=k+1$ such that $(k+1)^2 \\ge 2(k+1)$ This is where I get lost andI know I'm supposed to invoke the IH somewhere in the expression. But unlike the summation problem earlier, I'm not sure where to begin. Could anyone point me in the right direction?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Induction hypothesis is not  $2^k\\geq 2k$ but $k^2\\geq 2k$. Then, for $P(k+1)$, we have to prove $(k+1)^2\\geq 2(k+1)$. Proof: $(k+1)^2=k^2+2k+1$ but $k^2 \\geq 2k$ (by IH) $\\implies k^2+2k+1\\geq (2k+2k+1=4k+1)\\geq 2k+2$  as $k\\geq 1\\implies (k+1)^2\\geq 2(k+1)$. Hence ,$P(k+1)$ is true whenever $P(k)$ is true. Since $P(1)$ is true $\\implies P(n)$ is true $\\forall n\\in \\Bbb Z^+$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about structuring a problem from a Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example given shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The original question is about proving inequalities using induction, specifically the problem n² ≥ 2n for all n > 1.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user mentions their experience with induction on summations like the Gauss proof but struggles with inequalities. The actual problem here is proving n² ≥ 2n for n > 1 using induction. The example included in the problem is their attempt, which includes the basis step and inductive step but gets stuck at the inductive hypothesis part.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are that n is an integer, and n is greater than 1. The problem is to prove the inequality using induction. The example format lists each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property per line. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer\n- n > 1\n\nThen the problem is to prove that n² ≥ 2n for all n > 1.\n\nWait, but in the example provided in the user's initial message, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just stated \"for every integer n\". Hmm, but in that example, maybe the user made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be correct. Wait, no, looking again, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was a mistake. But the user is providing that as an example of how they want the format. So perhaps in their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. That might be an error in the example, but the user wants me to follow that structure regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is about proving n² ≥ 2n for all n > 1. The assumptions here are that n is an integer and n > 1. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition. The problem statement is to prove the inequality. So following the example's structure, each assumption is on a separate line. Therefore, the answer should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that n² ≥ 2n for all n > 1.\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra information. The user's question includes their confusion about applying induction to inequalities instead of summations, but the formatted problem should only include the core assumptions and the problem statement. The rest of the details (like their induction steps) are part of the original question but not needed in the structured format. So filtering out the extra text, the key problem is the inequality proof by induction with the given conditions.",
