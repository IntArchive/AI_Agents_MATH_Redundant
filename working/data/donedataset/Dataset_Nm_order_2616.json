    "Content": "I read in a paper that $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p) \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p) $ this is counterintuitive / surprising since $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{R}) \\not \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R}) $ I don't know about $p$-adic numbers, but for reals numbers small rotations are $1$ plus a skew-symmetric matrix: $$\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &  0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n+ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr} 0 &  a & b \\\\ -a & 0 & c \\\\ -b & -c & 0\\end{array}\\right]$$ Therefore a rotation of a sphere is defined by the three numbers $a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.  Next an element of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$: $$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{array} \\right]: ad-bc=1 $$ These also have three numbers, so at least the both spaces are $3$ dimensions, but $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{R})$ is compact, while $ \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is not compact.  For example a matrix like:\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\end{array} \\right] $$\nand we can use  any number instead of $2$ (such as a million, $10^6$). However, I do recall reading that $\\mathrm{SO}(2,1, \\mathbb{R})\\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ to make matters more confusing. Do we get any sort of identification when we try $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ instead of $\\mathbb{R}$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The thing is, as opposed to the case of $\\mathbb{R}$, there are few anisotropic quadratic forms over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. In fact over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, the standard quadratic form $\\langle 1,1,1\\rangle$  is not anisotropic but it is isometric to $\\langle 1,-1,-1\\rangle$, so given your statement for $SO_{2,1}(\\mathbb{R})$ this shouldn't be too surprising. The situation is as follows (all quadratic forms are supposed to be non-degenrerate) : any quadratic form $q$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be written $\\langle pa_1,\\dots,pa_r, b_1,\\dots,b_s\\rangle$ with $a_i,b_i\\in \\mathbb{Z_p}^*$. Then $q$ is uniquely characterized by $q_1 = \\langle \\overline{a_1},\\dots,\\overline{a_r}\\rangle$ and $q_2 = \\langle \\overline{b_1},\\dots,\\overline{b_s}\\rangle$ which are quadratic forms over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ ; and a quadratic form over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is uniquely characterized by its dimension and its discriminant. Now an elegant way to see that $SO_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p)\\simeq SL_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is the following : in general, if $Q$ is a quaternion algebra over a field $K$, then the quaternion norm $N$ of $Q$ is a quadratic form, and so is its restriction $q$ to pure quaternions $Q_0$. And it is known that the map $Q_1\\to SO(Q_0,q)$ defined by $z\\mapsto (x\\mapsto zx\\overline{z})$, where $Q_1 = \\{ z\\in Q\\,|\\, N(z)=1\\}$, is an isomorphism. EDIT : no, actually it has kernel $\\{\\pm 1\\}$, and this is also a mistake in your question I think. What we will get is $SL_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)/\\{\\pm1\\} \\simeq SO_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Now over $\\mathbb{R}$ there are two quaternion alegbras : $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and the Hamilton quternions $\\mathbb{H}$, and the corresponding $q$ are respectively $\\langle 1,-1,-1\\rangle$ and $\\langle 1,1,1\\rangle$, while the corresponding $Q_1$ are $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\mathbb{H}_1$ (which doesn't have an obvious simpler expression), which in particular gives us $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/\\{\\pm1\\} \\simeq SO_{2,1}(\\mathbb{R})$. But over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, the hamilton quaternions and the split quaternions $M_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ are isomorphic, precisely because $\\langle 1,-1,-1\\rangle$ and $\\langle 1,1,1\\rangle$ are isometric, so this gives $SL_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)/\\{\\pm1\\}\\simeq SO_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p)\\simeq SO_{2,1}(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me start by understanding the problem the user is presenting. The question is about showing that the special orthogonal group SO₃ over the p-adic numbers ℚₚ is isomorphic to the special linear group SL₂ over the same field. The user mentions that this is surprising because over the real numbers, SO₃(ℝ) isn't isomorphic to SL₂(ℝ). They also bring up some points about dimensions and compactness differences in the real case, and mention SO(2,1;ℝ) being isomorphic to SL₂(ℝ), which adds confusion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem correctly. The main task is to show the isomorphism between SO₃(ℚₚ) and SL₂(ℚₚ). The user is confused because this doesn't hold over the reals. So, the assumptions here would involve the definitions of these groups over the p-adic field. \n\nSO₃(ℚₚ) consists of 3x3 matrices with entries in ℚₚ that preserve a quadratic form (probably the standard one, since they didn't specify) and have determinant 1. SL₂(ℚₚ) is the group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1. The user didn't specify a particular quadratic form for SO₃, so I should assume the standard one unless stated otherwise. However, sometimes in lower dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms between classical groups. For instance, in the real case, SL₂(ℝ) is related to SO(2,1), which is a different orthogonal group with signature (2,1). Maybe over p-adic fields, the orthogonal group's structure changes because the quadratic form's behavior is different.\n\nThe user's confusion arises from the real case not holding, but in p-adic cases, the isomorphism exists. The problem's core is to establish this isomorphism. The assumptions need to be listed one by one. So, each line in the assumptions should address a single property. Let's see:\n\n1. The first assumption is about the group SO₃(ℚₚ), which is the special orthogonal group of degree 3 over ℚₚ. That means we're dealing with 3x3 matrices preserving a quadratic form, with determinant 1. But the exact quadratic form isn't specified. However, in the real case, the standard SO₃ preserves the quadratic form x² + y² + z². Over p-adics, maybe it's similar, but the isomorphism might depend on the quadratic form being isotropic. If the quadratic form is isotropic (i.e., there exists a non-trivial solution to x² + y² + z² = 0 in ℚₚ), then the orthogonal group might have a different structure. For example, over ℚₚ, the sum of squares is isotropic for p≠2, so maybe that's a key point. But since the problem doesn't specify the quadratic form, perhaps the standard one is assumed, and the isomorphism holds under that.\n\n2. The problem statement is to show that SO₃(ℚₚ) is isomorphic to SL₂(ℚₚ). But in the real case, SO₃ is compact and SL₂ is not, so they can't be isomorphic as Lie groups. However, over p-adic fields, the topology is totally different (totally disconnected), so compactness arguments don't apply in the same way. The isomorphism here is likely as algebraic groups, or maybe as topological groups. The user mentions they read it in a paper, so the context is algebraic groups over p-adic fields.\n\nAnother point: In low dimensions, there are exceptional isomorphisms between classical groups. For example, over algebraically closed fields, SL₂ is isomorphic to Sp₂, but here we're dealing with p-adic fields, which are not algebraically closed. However, maybe for certain orthogonal groups, there's an isomorphism. In the real case, SO(3) is related to SU(2)/{±1}, but that's a different case. Wait, SU(2) is compact, but here over p-adics, maybe the structure is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a specific isomorphism similar to how SL₂(ℚₚ) acts on a certain space, and this action induces an isomorphism to SO₃. For example, using the adjoint representation or something similar. Alternatively, the isomorphism could be constructed through the use of quaternions or other algebras over ℚₚ.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided additional details, so the main assumptions are:\n\n- Working over the p-adic field ℚₚ.\n- Considering the special orthogonal group SO₃(ℚₚ) with respect to some quadratic form.\n- Considering the special linear group SL₂(ℚₚ).\n\nThe problem is to show these two groups are isomorphic. The user's confusion stems from the real case not having this isomorphism, but over p-adics, it does. So the key assumptions would be about the definitions of the groups over ℚₚ and any specific conditions needed for the isomorphism (like the quadratic form being isotropic). But since the problem statement doesn't mention a particular quadratic form, perhaps the isomorphism holds for the standard quadratic form, which is isotropic over ℚₚ (for p ≠ 2, maybe?).\n\nHowever, the user might not have specified the quadratic form, so the problem as stated might assume a particular quadratic form that makes the isomorphism valid. So, in the assumptions, we need to list each condition:\n\n1. The base field is ℚₚ.\n2. The group SO₃ is defined with respect to a specific quadratic form (probably the standard one, but in p-adic context, this needs to be considered).\n3. The determinant condition for both groups: determinant 1 for SO₃ and SL₂.\n\nBut since the problem is to show the isomorphism, the assumptions are likely:\n\n- SO₃(ℚₚ) is the special orthogonal group over ℚₚ.\n- SL₂(ℚₚ) is the special linear group over ℚₚ.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's more. Maybe the quadratic form for SO₃ is split or isotropic, which allows the isomorphism. For instance, over ℝ, SO(3) is compact because the quadratic form is positive definite, but over ℚₚ, the standard quadratic form might be isotropic, leading to a non-compact group, which might be similar to SL₂(ℚₚ).\n\nBut the user's example mentioned SO(2,1;ℝ) ≃ SL₂(ℝ). So maybe in the p-adic case, the orthogonal group is in a split form (like SO(3) over ℚₚ with a split quadratic form) which would correspond to SL₂(ℚₚ). However, the problem states SO₃, which usually is the split form if the quadratic form is isotropic.\n\nSo, in the assumptions, perhaps:\n\n- The quadratic form defining SO₃(ℚₚ) is isotropic.\n\nBut since the original problem statement doesn't mention this, maybe it's implicit. Alternatively, over ℚₚ, the quadratic form x² + y² + z² is isotropic (for p ≠ 2), hence SO₃(ℚₚ) is split, leading to the isomorphism.\n\nBut given that the user's original problem statement is as written, I need to extract the assumptions as per the format. The original question says \"Show that SO₃(ℚₚ) ≃ SL₂(ℚₚ)\". The user mentions that over ℝ, this isn't true, but over ℚₚ, it is. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- The base field is ℚₚ.\n- The group SO₃ is defined over ℚₚ.\n- The group SL₂ is defined over ℚₚ.\n\nBut maybe there's more structure. Wait, the user didn't specify any particular conditions on p, like p ≠ 2. However, in p-adic fields, quadratic forms behave differently for p=2. But since the problem states ℚₚ without qualification, perhaps we need to assume p ≠ 2. However, the original problem didn't specify, so maybe we shouldn't include that unless it's in the problem statement.\n\nBut the problem as stated on Math Stack Exchange is just \"Show that SO₃(ℚₚ) ≃ SL₂(ℚₚ)\", so the assumptions are inherent to the problem. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe base field is ℚₚ.\nSO₃(ℚₚ) is the special orthogonal group of degree 3 over ℚₚ.\nSL₂(ℚₚ) is the special linear group of degree 2 over ℚₚ.\n\nBut the original example had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", so each line addresses one property. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is considered over the p-adic numbers,\nThe group $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is considered over the p-adic numbers,\nThe quadratic form defining $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is isotropic.\n\nWait, but does the problem mention the quadratic form being isotropic? The user's question doesn't specify that. So perhaps the problem assumes a standard quadratic form which is isotropic over ℚₚ, leading to the isomorphism. But if the original problem statement doesn't mention it, should I include it as an assumption?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context of p-adic fields, the special orthogonal group in three variables is always isomorphic to SL₂. However, that might depend on the quadratic form. For example, if the quadratic form is split, then SO₃ would be split and isomorphic to PSL₂ or something. But I think in odd dimensions, the split orthogonal group is related to symplectic groups, but maybe in three dimensions, there's an exceptional isomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the isomorphism is through the use of the adjoint action. SL₂ acts on its Lie algebra, which is three-dimensional, and preserves the Killing form, which is a quadratic form. Hence, this would give a homomorphism from SL₂ to SO₃. Over p-adic fields, this might be an isomorphism.\n\nBut to structure the problem, the user wants assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition. Since the original problem statement doesn't specify the quadratic form, maybe the assumption is just that we are working over ℚₚ, and the groups are SO₃ and SL₂. However, in the example given, the user included \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the example seems to have a mistake. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to show filtering of unrelated information, but the original problem had a redundant assumption? Maybe the example is incorrect, but regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question is to show that SO₃(ℚₚ) ≃ SL₂(ℚₚ). The assumptions here would be that we're working over ℚₚ, and that the groups in question are SO₃ and SL₂. However, in the example, assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n, so perhaps the example is wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to filter out the extra information from the question. The original question on Math Stack Exchange has a lot of discussion about real numbers, compactness, dimensions, etc., but those are not part of the actual problem to solve. The actual problem is to show the isomorphism over ℚₚ. So, the task is to extract the core problem and list the assumptions.\n\nThe actual problem is: Show that SO₃(ℚₚ) ≃ SL₂(ℚₚ). The assumptions are that we're working with these groups over the p-adic field. The rest of the text in the question is context, confusion, examples in reals, which are unrelated to the actual problem.\n\nTherefore, following the example (even if the example had a mistake), we need to list the assumptions. The assumptions here are:\n\n- The base field is ℚₚ (p-adic numbers).\n- SO₃(ℚₚ) is the special orthogonal group in three dimensions over ℚₚ.\n- SL₂(ℚₚ) is the special linear group in two dimensions over ℚₚ.\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group $\\mathrm{SO}_3$ is considered over the field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$,\nThe group $\\mathrm{SL}_2$ is considered over the field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p) \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify any conditions on the quadratic form for SO₃, so maybe we have to assume it's the split form, which is isotropic. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps that's part of the problem. But as per the example, we need to list only the assumptions inherent to the problem. The original problem says \"Show that SO₃(ℚₚ) is isomorphic to SL₂(ℚₚ)\", so the assumptions are that we're working over ℚₚ and considering those groups.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe group $\\mathrm{SO}_3$ is defined over the p-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$,\nThe group $\\mathrm{SL}_2$ is defined over the p-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\mathrm{SO}_3(\\mathbb{Q}_p) \\simeq \\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each group is considered as an algebraic group over ℚₚ. But since the user hasn't specified, it's safer to stick to the basic definitions.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after filtering the unrelated information (like the real case comparisons), the structured problem is as above.",
