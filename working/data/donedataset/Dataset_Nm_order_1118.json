    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that every finite extension of a finite field is separable. I found a solution on internet which says: Let $F$ be a finite field and $E$ be an extension of $F$ having  $p^n$\n  elements. Then $E=F(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha \\in E$ and so\n  $\\alpha^{p^n} -\\alpha=0$. This implies $\\alpha$ is a separable\n  element, and hence $F(\\alpha)$ is a separable extension of F. I don't understand why $\\alpha^{p^n} -\\alpha=0$ and why $\\alpha$ is a separable element, I need help. Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is cyclic, if a field has $\\,p^n\\,$ elements, then its multiplicative group has $\\,p^n-1\\,$ elements, and thus for any non-zero element $\\,\\alpha\\,$ in the field, $$\\alpha^{p^n-1}=1\\Longrightarrow \\alpha^{p^n}=\\alpha\\Longleftrightarrow \\alpha^{p^n}-\\alpha=0$$ Note that the above equality is true also for the zero element in the field. Thus, any element in a field with $\\,p^n\\,$ elements is a root of $\\,x^{p^n}-x\\,$ , and this pol. is separable since its derivative is $\\,p^nx^{p^n-1}-1=-1\\neq 0\\pmod p\\,$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking why α^(p^n) - α = 0 implies that α is separable over F, and consequently why every finite extension of a finite field is separable. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a separable extension is. An algebraic extension E/F is separable if every element of E is separable over F, meaning the minimal polynomial of each element has distinct roots. For fields of characteristic p, a common issue is inseparability when dealing with polynomials like x^p - a, which might have multiple roots.\n\nNow, the user mentions that E is an extension of F with p^n elements. Since F is a finite field, say of order p^m, then E being an extension of F must have order p^m*k for some k. But the problem states that E has p^n elements, so perhaps F has order p, making E of order p^n. Wait, the original problem says \"every finite extension of a finite field is separable\". So regardless of F being any finite field, its finite extension E should be separable.\n\nThe solution provided states that E = F(α) for some α (by the primitive element theorem, which holds for finite fields), and that α^(p^n) - α = 0. This equation comes from the fact that in a finite field with p^n elements, every element satisfies x^(p^n) = x. So α is an element of E, hence α^(p^n) = α. \n\nBut why does this imply α is separable? The minimal polynomial of α over F must have distinct roots. For finite fields, even though we have characteristic p, the Frobenius endomorphism (x ↦ x^p) is an automorphism. This means that the polynomial x^(p^n) - x splits into distinct linear factors in its splitting field, which is E itself. Each element of E is a root of this polynomial, and since x^(p^n) - x has no repeated roots (its derivative is -1, which has no roots, hence no multiple factors), all its roots are simple. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of α must divide x^(p^n) - x and hence must also have distinct roots. Thus, α is separable over F.\n\nTherefore, every generator α of E over F is separable, so E/F is a separable extension. The key points here are the properties of finite fields: their extensions are simple, the polynomial x^(p^n) - x has only simple roots, and the minimal polynomial of any element in a finite field extension must therefore be separable.\n\nNow, structuring this according to the required format. The assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement is to prove every finite extension of a finite field is separable.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions include specific conditions on the variables. Here, the assumptions would involve the properties of F, E, and α. So:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is a finite extension of F,\nAssumption: E has p^n elements for some prime p and integer n,\nAssumption: E = F(α) for some α ∈ E,\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that every finite extension of a finite field is separable.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"every finite extension of a finite field is separable\". The user's question is about understanding the given proof. The assumptions here are taken from the solution the user found. So in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions given in that solution, not the general case. The solution starts by letting F be a finite field, E an extension with p^n elements, E=F(α), and α^(p^n)-α=0. So the assumptions should be those steps. But the user is confused why α^(p^n)-α=0 implies α is separable. Therefore, the problem in the formatted version is to show that under these assumptions, F(α)/F is separable. Or perhaps the problem is as stated, but the assumptions are the given context.\n\nWait, the original problem is \"Prove that every finite extension of a finite field is separable.\" The solution provided uses the fact that E=F(α) and α^(p^n)-α=0 to conclude α is separable. The user is confused why α^(p^n)-α=0 leads to α being separable.\n\nBut when structuring the problem according to the example, the original problem is restated with the assumptions listed. In the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which was in the solution but not in the original problem. Wait, the example given by the user seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems to add an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might be an error. Wait, maybe in the example, the user intended to filter out some unrelated information and restructure the problem with the necessary assumptions. Perhaps the original problem had some context where n is divisible by 7, but in the given original problem statement, it's for every integer n, so adding \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. Hmm, maybe that example is a mistake, but the user wants me to follow that format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is \"Prove that every finite extension of a finite field is separable.\" The solution provided uses specific assumptions: F is finite, E is an extension of F with p^n elements, E=F(α), and α^(p^n)-α=0. The user is confused about why α^(p^n)-α=0 implies α is separable. So perhaps in structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions given in the solution, and then the problem is to show that under those assumptions, F(α)/F is separable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem remains \"Prove that every finite extension of a finite field is separable,\" and the assumptions are the context given in the solution. Let me see how the example was structured. The original problem was general, but the formatted problem added an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. However, maybe in that example, the user intended to show a filtered problem where the original problem had hidden assumptions. But perhaps the example is not perfect.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the user found a solution that makes certain assumptions. The task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format. The original problem is to prove every finite extension of a finite field is separable. The solution in the question mentions F is a finite field, E is an extension with p^n elements, E=F(α), and α^(p^n)-α=0. The user's confusion is about why α^(p^n)-α=0 implies α is separable. Therefore, the structured problem should include these assumptions and the problem is to show that under these conditions, α is separable over F, hence E/F is separable.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is an extension field of F with p^n elements,\nAssumption: E = F(α) for some α ∈ E,\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that α is a separable element over F, hence E is a separable extension of F.\n\nBut the original problem is more general, but the user is asking about this specific proof. Alternatively, the problem could remain as the original statement, but the assumptions are the ones used in the proof. However, following the example, even if the original problem is general, the formatted problem includes specific assumptions from the solution. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is a finite extension of F,\nAssumption: E has p^n elements,\nAssumption: E = F(α),\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that E is a separable extension of F.\n\nBut the original problem is to prove every finite extension of a finite field is separable, which is more general. But the user is referencing a specific proof attempt, so structuring it based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as in the example: the original problem is general, but the formatted problem narrows it down with specific assumptions from the solution. However, in the example, the formatted problem added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. But in reality, the original problem's solution might require that n is an integer, but the divisibility by 91 holds for all n, but maybe the example had a typo.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the formatted problem should include the assumptions from the solution provided in the question. The user's question is about understanding that specific solution. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is an extension field of F,\nAssumption: E has p^n elements,\nAssumption: E = F(α) for some α ∈ E,\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that α is a separable element over F.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem is to prove every finite extension is separable, but the specific step the user is stuck on is why α^(p^n)-α=0 implies α is separable. Therefore, the formatted problem would be to show that under the given conditions, α is separable.\n\nIn the example, the problem was restated with the assumptions, even if they added an extra one. So following that pattern, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is a finite extension of F,\nAssumption: E has p^n elements,\nAssumption: E = F(α),\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that E is a separable extension of F.\n\nBut the problem is already given in the assumptions. Alternatively, the problem is to show that α is separable over F, which would then imply E/F is separable.\n\nBut given the example, it seems the problem statement is kept as the original, with the assumptions added from the solution. So here, the original problem is to prove every finite extension of a finite field is separable. The solution uses F finite, E=F(α) with α^(p^n)-α=0, and concludes α is separable. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those assumptions and the problem remains to prove the extension is separable.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was modified to include specific assumptions. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: F is a finite field,\nAssumption: E is a finite extension of F with p^n elements,\nAssumption: E = F(α) where α ∈ E,\nAssumption: α^(p^n) - α = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that E is a separable extension of F.\n\nThis way, the problem is structured with the given assumptions from the solution, and the problem is to prove the conclusion. This matches the example where assumptions were added to the original problem. Even though the original problem is more general, the formatted version focuses on the specific case presented in the solution the user is questioning.\n\nYes, this seems to align with the example. Therefore, the answer would be structured accordingly.",
