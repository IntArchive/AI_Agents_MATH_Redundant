    "Content": "During my work I came up with this integral: $$\\mathcal{J} = \\int_0^{+\\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{x}\\ln(x)}{e^{\\sqrt{x}}}\\ \\text{d}x$$ Mathematica has a very elegant and simple numerical result for this, which is $$\\mathcal{J} = 12 - 8\\gamma$$ where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The integral given is ∫₀^∞ sqrt(x) ln(x) / e^sqrt(x) dx, and the answer is supposed to be 12 - 8γ, where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I notice that the integral has sqrt(x) and ln(x) in the numerator, and the denominator is e^sqrt(x). The limits are from 0 to infinity. Maybe substitution can help simplify this. Let me try substituting t = sqrt(x). Then x = t², so dx = 2t dt. Let's see:\n\nWhen x = 0, t = 0. When x → ∞, t → ∞. So substituting, the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ (t * ln(t²)) / e^t * 2t dt\n\nSimplify ln(t²) as 2 ln t. Then:\n\n∫₀^∞ t * 2 ln t / e^t * 2t dt = ∫₀^∞ 4 t² ln t / e^t dt\n\nWait, let me check that again. Original substitution:\n\nsqrt(x) = t → x = t² → dx = 2t dt. Then sqrt(x) = t, ln(x) = ln(t²) = 2 ln t. So plugging into the integral:\n\n∫₀^∞ [t * 2 ln t] / e^t * 2t dt. The sqrt(x) is t, ln(x) is 2 ln t, dx is 2t dt. So the integrand becomes (t * 2 ln t) / e^t * 2t dt. Multiplying together: t * 2 ln t * 2t / e^t = 4 t² ln t / e^t. So the integral becomes 4 ∫₀^∞ t² ln t e^{-t} dt.\n\nSo now the integral is 4 times the integral of t² ln t e^{-t} from 0 to infinity. Hmm. I remember that integrals involving t^n e^{-t} relate to the Gamma function. The Gamma function is Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt. But here we have t² ln t e^{-t}. Maybe there's a way to express this integral in terms of the derivative of the Gamma function?\n\nYes, because the derivative of Γ(n) with respect to n would involve integrating t^{n-1} ln t e^{-t}. Let's recall that Γ'(n) = ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} ln t e^{-t} dt. So if I set n = 3, then Γ'(3) = ∫₀^∞ t^{2} ln t e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral we have is Γ'(3). So our integral becomes 4 Γ'(3).\n\nBut then, how do we compute Γ'(3)? I know that Γ(n) = (n-1)! for integer n. So Γ(3) = 2! = 2. But what about Γ'(3)? There's a relation involving the digamma function, which is ψ(n) = Γ'(n)/Γ(n). So Γ'(n) = ψ(n) Γ(n). Therefore, Γ'(3) = ψ(3) Γ(3). Since Γ(3) = 2!, which is 2, then Γ'(3) = 2 ψ(3).\n\nNow, what's ψ(3)? The digamma function ψ(n) for integer n is given by ψ(n) = -γ + Σ_{k=1}^{n-1} 1/k. So for n=3, ψ(3) = -γ + 1/1 + 1/2 = -γ + 3/2. Therefore, Γ'(3) = 2*(-γ + 3/2) = -2γ + 3.\n\nTherefore, the integral 4 Γ'(3) = 4*(-2γ + 3) = -8γ + 12. Which is exactly 12 - 8γ. So that checks out! Therefore, the result is indeed 12 - 8γ.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check substitution again. t = sqrt(x), so x = t², dx = 2t dt. Original integrand is sqrt(x) ln x / e^{sqrt(x)} dx. Substitute sqrt(x) = t, so sqrt(x) = t, ln x = ln t² = 2 ln t, dx = 2t dt. Then integrand becomes t * 2 ln t / e^t * 2t dt. So combining terms: t * 2 ln t * 2t / e^t dt = 4 t² ln t e^{-t} dt. Correct. Then integral becomes 4 ∫ t² ln t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞. Correct.\n\nThen, recognizing that ∫ t^{n-1} ln t e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞ is Γ'(n). So here n=3, so Γ'(3) = ∫ t² ln t e^{-t} dt. So the integral is 4 Γ'(3). Then Γ'(3) = ψ(3) Γ(3). Γ(3) is 2! = 2. ψ(3) is digamma function at 3. For positive integers, ψ(m) = -γ + Σ_{k=1}^{m-1} 1/k. So for m=3, sum from k=1 to 2: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Hence ψ(3) = -γ + 3/2. So Γ'(3) = (-γ + 3/2)*2 = -2γ + 3. Multiply by 4: 4*(-2γ +3) = -8γ +12. Correct.\n\nYes, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer is 12 - 8γ. So the integral equals 12 - 8γ as given. Therefore, the problem is solved.",
