    "Content": "Given a descending sequence of sets $$\nF_1\\supset F_2\\supset\\cdots F_n\\supset\\cdots \n$$ \nin which each $F_i$ is connected. I wonder if the limit set $$\nF=\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty F_i\n$$\nis still connected? I believe it is, but cannot make a proof. Anyone can help? Updated: Samuel has showed a counter example. Thus now I wonder can I add some constraints such that the conclusion holds? I ask this problem because when I look up the The Princeton Companion to Mathematics ，chapter IV.14. Dynamics, section 2.8 The Mandelbrot Set M, there is the following words: It follows from the above that as $t$ approaches zero, the equipotential\n  of potential $t$, together with its interior, gets closer and closer\n  to M: that is, M is the intersection of all such sets. Hence, M is a\n  connected, closed, bounded subset of the plane. I wonder why such argument shows $M$, the Mandelbrot set, is connected.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No. Let $F_n$ be the the plane $\\mathbb R^2$ minus the line $\\{0\\}\\times(-\\infty,n)$. Added: It is true when all the $F_n$ are compact subsets of $\\mathbb R^N$. Suppose otherwise: then there exist open disjoint sets $A,B$ such that $F$ contains points of both $A$ and $B$ and $F$ is contained in $A\\cup B$. Now consider $F_n\\cap (\\partial A)$. Since each $F_n$ is connected, and contains points in both $A$ and $B$, the intersection $F_n\\cap (\\partial A)$ must be nonempty, and moreover, for $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$ it is a decreasing sequence of compact sets, and therefore the intersection of all $F_n\\cap (\\partial A)$ is nonempty. Contradiction. Thus $F$ is connected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The user has a question about whether the intersection of a descending sequence of connected sets remains connected. They initially thought it was true but found a counterexample. Now they want to know what additional constraints would make the conclusion hold, referencing the Mandelbrot set example.\n\nThe task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the original problem: it's about a descending sequence F₁ ⊃ F₂ ⊃ ... where each Fᵢ is connected. The question is whether the intersection F is still connected. After a counterexample was shown, the user wants to add constraints so that F remains connected. The example given relates to the Mandelbrot set, which is proven connected by being the intersection of connected sets with increasing potentials.\n\nAssumptions need to be extracted. The original problem's assumptions are a descending sequence of connected sets. The user is now asking about additional constraints. But how to phrase that as assumptions?\n\nWait, the problem after the update is: can we add some constraints such that the intersection remains connected? So the problem is to find conditions under which the intersection of a descending sequence of connected sets is connected.\n\nSo the assumptions would include the basic setup: a descending sequence of connected sets, and then any additional constraints that might be imposed to ensure connectedness.\n\nBut the example given in the problem mentions the Mandelbrot set, where the intersection is of connected sets (equipotentials and their interiors) that are getting closer to M. The key here might be that the sets are compact and connected in a space like the plane. Maybe the additional constraints needed are compactness and being in a continuum (like the plane), or perhaps that each set is compact and connected in a Hausdorff space, ensuring the intersection is connected.\n\nBut the user's question is to structure the problem as per the example. The original problem's assumptions were that each F_i is connected and the sequence is descending. But since the user now wants to add constraints, the problem is to determine under what additional conditions the intersection remains connected.\n\nSo the Assumptions part should list the initial conditions plus any added constraints. However, the user is asking for possible constraints, so the problem is to find such constraints. But how to frame this in the given format?\n\nWait, the example given in the problem structure had specific assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the user is asking for additional constraints. So perhaps the problem is to determine what constraints are needed, given the original assumptions (descending connected sets) and any other necessary ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that under certain constraints, the intersection is connected. So the assumptions would be the original setup plus those constraints.\n\nBut the user's updated question is: \"Thus now I wonder can I add some constraints such that the conclusion holds?\" So they want to know what constraints would make the intersection connected. Therefore, the problem is to find such constraints. However, the format requires listing assumptions and then the problem.\n\nPerhaps the problem is: \"What additional constraints can be added such that the intersection F is connected?\" But the example given in the problem structure had a problem to prove something. Here, the problem is more of a question about what conditions would ensure connectedness.\n\nBut the original example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions. Here, maybe the problem is \"Determine additional constraints such that F is connected.\"\n\nBut how to phrase this in the required format. The Assumptions would include the descending sequence of connected sets. Then the problem is to find additional constraints that make F connected. Alternatively, the problem is \"Under what additional constraints is F connected?\" But the example uses \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here it's \"Determine the additional constraints under which F is connected.\"\n\nBut the user's own example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So maybe here, after adding constraints, the problem becomes \"Prove that F is connected under additional constraints X, Y, Z.\"\n\nBut the user hasn't specified the constraints; they're asking for possible constraints. So perhaps the problem is to \"Find additional constraints such that F is connected,\" but the format requires a problem statement that can be addressed. Alternatively, the problem is \"Prove that F is connected under the following constraints.\"\n\nHowever, the user's exact question after the update is: \"Thus now I wonder can I add some constraints such that the conclusion holds? ... I wonder why such argument shows M, the Mandelbrot set, is connected.\"\n\nSo the problem is: \"Under what additional constraints does the intersection F remain connected?\" and the example given in the dynamics text uses that M is the intersection of connected sets (equipotentials with interiors) and thus M is connected. So in that case, the connected sets are compact and nested in a continuum (the plane), and perhaps each is compact and connected, leading to the intersection being connected.\n\nIn topology, a classic result is that the intersection of a nested sequence of compact connected sets in a Hausdorff space is connected. So the additional constraints might be that each F_i is compact and the space is Hausdorff (like the plane). So the problem would be to prove that if each F_i is compact and connected in a Hausdorff space, then the intersection is connected.\n\nBut the user's problem is to structure the original question into the format. The original problem's assumptions are the descending sequence of connected sets. The updated question is asking for additional constraints. So the assumptions should include the original ones plus the added constraints, but since the user is seeking what constraints to add, maybe the problem is to determine those constraints. However, the format example had specific assumptions leading to a specific problem. Here, the user's problem is more open-ended.\n\nBut perhaps the way to frame it is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F₁ ⊃ F₂ ⊃ ... is a descending sequence of connected sets.\n- Each F_i is compact.\n- The ambient space is a Hausdorff space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the intersection F = ∩_{i=1}^∞ F_i is connected.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified these constraints; they are asking what constraints to add. However, the example from the Mandelbrot set mentions that each set is closed, bounded (hence compact in the plane), and connected, leading to M being connected. Therefore, the problem in the Mandelbrot case uses compactness in a Hausdorff space (the plane is Hausdorff) as the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would have assumptions including compactness and perhaps the ambient space, leading to the problem statement to prove connectedness of F.\n\nBut the user's original problem after the update is: \"Thus now I wonder can I add some constraints such that the conclusion holds?\" So they want to know what constraints to add. But according to the format, we need to structure the problem with assumptions and the problem. So perhaps the problem is to prove that under certain constraints, F is connected. The user is referencing the Mandelbrot set case where they used such an argument.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the descending sequence of connected, compact sets in a Hausdorff space, and the problem is to prove the intersection is connected.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is asking for possible constraints, but the format requires a problem with given assumptions and a problem statement, then we can structure it as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F₁ ⊃ F₂ ⊃ ... is a descending sequence of connected sets.\n- Each F_i is compact.\n- The ambient space is a Hausdorff space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the intersection F = ∩_{i=1}^∞ F_i is connected.\n\nBut to confirm, in general topology, the intersection of a decreasing sequence of compact connected sets in a Hausdorff space is connected. So this is a known result. Therefore, the problem could be structured with those assumptions, leading to the conclusion.\n\nGiven that the user mentions the Mandelbrot set example, where the sets are compact (closed and bounded in the plane) and connected, their intersection M is connected. Therefore, the additional constraints needed are compactness and perhaps the ambient space being Hausdorff.\n\nSo putting this all together, the formatted problem would have the assumptions including compactness of each F_i and the Hausdorff condition on the space, and the problem to prove the intersection is connected.",
