    "Content": "I'd like to show $P(z)=1-2z^2-2z^3-2z^4-2z^5$ has a unique root inside the disk $|z|<0.6$ . I tried using Rouche's theorem, which worked for polynomials of this form $1-2z^2-2z^3-2z^4...-2z^n$ but of higher degrees, but the same method did not work on $n=5$ or smaller $n$ . For higher degrees, I used it as follows, multiplying by $z-1$ we obtain the polynomial $-2z^{n+1}+2z^2+z-1$ . By defining $f(z)=2z^2+z-1=2(z+1)(z-\\frac{1}{2})$ and $g(z)=-2z^{n+1}$ one can show (using the regular and reverse triangle inequality) that on $|z|=0.6$ we have $|f(z)|>|g(z)|$ for $n\\geq6$ . However for $n=3,4,5$ this method failed. I'm wondering if there's another way besides Rouche's theorem, or maybe a different use of Rouche here, or even some idea on why Rouche doesn't work on those values. Just note that $0.6$ is not especially important, it's what I thought to use myself to find a proof of a certain claim. Similar radii (not far from $0.6$ ) that guarantee a unique root inside it would also be helpful.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will expand on my comment.  Following the OP's attempt, I will minimize $$F(x,y)=\\big|f(x+yi)\\big|=2\\sqrt{\\big((x+1)^2+y^2\\big)\\big((x-1/2)^2+y^2\\big)}$$ subject to $x^2+y^2=r^2$ ( $r$ is a non-negative constant).  Let $$\\mathcal{L}(x,y,\\lambda)=\\frac14\\big(F(x,y)\\big)^2+\\lambda(x^2+y^2-r^2).$$ We set $$0=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x}=2(x+1)\\big((x-1/2)^2+y^2\\big)+2(x-1/2)\\big((x+1)^2+y^2)+2\\lambda x,\\tag{1}$$ $$0=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y}=2y\\big((x-1/2)^2+y^2\\big)+2y\\big((x+1)^2+y^2)+2\\lambda y.$$ For the second equation, we have either that $y=0$ or $$(x-1/2)^2+(x+1)^2+2y^2+\\lambda=0.\\tag{2}$$ We also have the constraint condition $$y^2=r^2-x^2.\\tag{3}$$ Thus $y=0$ yields solutions $$(x,y)=(\\pm r,0).$$ We have $$a(r)=F(r,0)=|2r^2+r-1|$$ and $$b(r)=F(-r,0)=|2r^2-r-1|$$ From now on suppose that $y\\ne 0$ .  Therefore $(2)$ holds.  Plug $(3)$ into $(1)$ and $(2)$ to get $$(x+1)\\big((x-1/2)^2-x^2+r^2\\big)+(x-1/2)\\big((x+1)^2-x^2+r^2\\big)+\\lambda x=0\\tag{4}$$ and $$(x-1/2)^2+(x+1)^2-2x^2+2r^2+\\lambda=0.$$ The previous equation gives $$x=-2r^2-\\lambda-5/4.\\tag{5}$$ Plug $(5)$ into $(4)$ to get $$-\\left(2r^2+\\lambda+\\frac14\\right)\\left(3r^2+\\lambda+\\frac32\\right)+\\left(2r^2+\\lambda+\\frac74\\right)\\left(3r^2+2\\lambda+\\frac32\\right)-\\lambda\\left(2r^2+\\lambda+\\frac54\\right)=0.$$ That is, $$\\lambda=-\\frac{9(2r^2+1)}{8}.$$ This means $$x=-2r^2+\\frac{9(2r^2+1)}{8}-\\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{2r^2-1}{8}.$$ Therefore $$y=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{-4r^4+68r^2-1}}{8},$$ which is real only if $$0.12132\\approx \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-4}{2}\\le r \\le \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+4}{2}\\approx 4.12132.$$ Observe that \\begin{align}c(r)&=F\\left(\\frac{2r^2-1}{8},\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{-4r^2+68r-1}}{8}\\right)\\\\&=2\\sqrt{\\left(r^2+2\\cdot\\frac{2r^2-1}{8}+1\\right)\\left(r^2-\\frac{2r^2-1}{8}+\\frac14\\right)}\\\\&=\\frac{3(2r^2+1)}{2\\sqrt2}.\\end{align} We have $$\\big(c(r)\\big)^2-\\big(a(r)\\big)^2=\\frac{(2r^2-8r-1)^2}{8}\\geq 0$$ and $$\\big(c(r)\\big)^2-\\big(b(r)\\big)^2=\\frac{(2r^2+8r-1)^2}{8}\\geq 0.$$ Therefore, $a(r)\\leq c(r)$ and $b(r)\\leq c(r)$ always. Therefore, the minimum of $F(x,y)$ with $x^2+y^2=r^2$ is $$m(r)=\\min\\{a(r),b(r)\\}=\\min\\big\\{|2r^2+r-1|,|2r^2-r-1|\\big\\}.$$ Since $m(0.6)=0.32$ , we see that $$\\big|g(z)\\big|=\\big|-2z^{n+1}\\big|=2\\cdot 0.6^{n+1}\\leq 2\\cdot 0.6^4=0.2592<0.32\\leq \\big|f(z)\\big|$$ for $n\\geq 3$ and $|z|=0.6$ .  Because $f(z)=2z^2+z-1$ has exactly one root $z=1/2$ inside the disk $|z|<0.6$ , by Rouche's theorem, $$1-2z^2-2z^3-\\ldots-2z^n=\\frac{f(z)+g(z)}{z-1}$$ has exactly one root inside $|z|<0.6$ .  (If you replace $0.6$ by $0.7$ , the statement is still true.) Question: This left me wonder whether this is true.  Let $f(z)$ be a polynomial function with only real roots.  Is it true that the minimum value of $\\big|f(z)\\big|$ on any circle $|z|=r$ is attained at $z=r$ or $z=-r$ (clearly $z=\\pm r$ are critical points)?  Can someone prove or disprove this? Edit: Fixed miscalculations.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the polynomial P(z) = 1 - 2z² - 2z³ - 2z⁴ - 2z⁵ has a unique root inside the disk |z| < 0.6. They tried using Rouché's theorem but it worked only for higher degrees (n ≥ 6) when they multiplied by (z - 1) to get a different form. For n=5 or lower, their approach didn't work. They’re asking for alternative methods or a different application of Rouché, or maybe insight into why it fails here.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem as per the given format. Let's parse the original question to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nAssumptions: The problem mentions P(z) as given, and the disk |z| < 0.6. The user also tried using Rouché's theorem with a specific approach (multiplying by (z - 1)) but it failed for n=5. However, the key assumptions here are about the polynomial itself and the region of interest. The user is considering the disk of radius 0.6, so that's an assumption. The polynomial is of degree 5. They tried using Rouché but it didn't work for lower n. However, the problem statement itself is to show the unique root inside |z| < 0.6 for the given P(z). So the assumptions would include the polynomial's form and the disk's radius.\n\nWait, the example given earlier lists assumptions as properties applied to one object each. So here, the polynomial is fixed, so maybe the assumptions are about the polynomial's terms and the disk's radius. But since the polynomial is given explicitly, perhaps the main assumption is that we're working within the disk |z| < 0.6, and the problem is to show uniqueness and existence of a root there.\n\nSo, structured:\n\nAssumption:\nP(z) = 1 - 2z² - 2z³ - 2z⁴ - 2z⁵,\nthe disk is |z| < 0.6.\n\nProblem:\nShow that P(z) has a unique root inside the disk |z| < 0.6.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the polynomial is fixed, but maybe the disk's radius is a condition. However, since the problem is to show a root exists within that disk, the radius is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the user says \"has a unique root inside the disk |z| < 0.6\". So the disk's radius is part of the problem, not an assumption. The assumption would be that z is in the complex plane, but perhaps more accurately, the problem is about roots within that specific disk. Wait, the example's assumptions included conditions on n. Here, maybe there are no variables with conditions except that the polynomial is as given, and we're considering the disk of radius 0.6. However, the problem doesn't have variables with conditions beyond the polynomial's definition. So perhaps the only assumption is the polynomial's form and the disk's radius. But since the problem is to show a property of the polynomial in that disk, maybe the disk's radius is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Wait, the user's example had the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which were conditions on n. Here, maybe there are no such conditions except that the problem is about the polynomial P(z) as defined. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is just the polynomial's expression, and the disk's radius is part of the problem. But the problem statement includes the disk, so maybe the assumption is that we are considering complex numbers z with |z| < 0.6. However, according to the example, assumptions list properties applied to one object each. So:\n\nAssumption:\nP(z) is defined as 1 - 2z² - 2z³ - 2z⁴ - 2z⁵,\nthe disk |z| < 0.6 is considered.\n\nBut wait, the disk is part of the problem's condition. The example's assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was a condition. Here, perhaps the disk's radius is part of the problem's assertion. Wait, the problem is to show that in |z| < 0.6, there's a unique root. So the disk is part of the problem's setting. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is the polynomial's definition. Wait, perhaps the user wants the problem statement to include \"inside the disk of radius 0.6\", so the problem is as stated. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the formatted problem lists those as assumptions. Here, the original problem states \"has a unique root inside the disk |z| < 0.6\", so the problem is to show that under the given polynomial, there's a unique root there. The assumptions would be the polynomial's form and perhaps that z is a complex number (but that's implicit). However, according to the example, assumptions are specific conditions. Since the polynomial is given, maybe the only assumption is the definition of P(z). But in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, perhaps the disk radius is part of the problem, not an assumption. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nP(z) = 1 - 2z² - 2z³ - 2z⁴ - 2z⁵.\n\nProblem:\nShow that P(z) has a unique root inside the disk |z| < 0.6.\n\nBut the original problem states \"has a unique root inside the disk of radius 0.6\", so that's the problem. The user tried using Rouché but it failed for lower n. So the formatted problem should capture that the disk |z| < 0.6 is part of the problem statement. So the assumptions are just the polynomial's definition, and the problem is to show the unique root in that disk. Alternatively, the disk's radius is an assumption? No, because the problem is about showing a property within that disk. Therefore, the assumption would just be the polynomial's form. The problem is to show the existence and uniqueness within the disk. So the formatted problem should be as follows.",
