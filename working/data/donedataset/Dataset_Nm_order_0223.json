    "Content": "Suppose we are given the following: $$\\left| \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) g(x) \\ dx \\right| \\leq \\int_{a}^{b} |f(x)|\\cdot |g(x)| \\ dx$$ How would we prove this? Does this follow from Cauchy Schwarz? Intuitively this is how I see it: In the LHS we could have a negative area that reduces the positive area. In the RHS the area can only increase because we take the absolute values of the functions first.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The big idea here is this: First: it is enough to show that\n$$\n\\left\\lvert\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx\\right\\rvert\\leq\\int_a^b\\lvert f(x)\\rvert dx,\n$$\nsince you can replace $f(x)$ by $f(x)\\cdot g(x)$ to get the desired result. Now, notice that\n$$\n-\\lvert f(x)\\rvert\\leq f(x)\\leq \\lvert f(x)\\rvert\n$$\nfor all $x$; hence\n$$\n-\\int_a^b\\lvert f(x)\\rvert\\,dx\\leq \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx\\leq\\int_a^b\\lvert f(x)\\rvert\\,dx.\n$$\nCan you finish it from here?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem is about proving an integral inequality involving absolute values. The user is asking whether this follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and provides an intuitive explanation. \n\nLooking at the inequality presented: the absolute value of the integral of f(x)g(x) from a to b is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute values of f(x) and g(x) over the same interval. \n\nNow, to list the assumptions. The problem mentions functions f and g, and integrates over the interval [a, b]. The key assumptions here would relate to the properties of these functions and the integral. \n\nFirst, the functions f and g must be integrable on [a, b], otherwise the integrals wouldn't make sense. The user didn't specify, but in such inequalities, typically f and g are assumed to be Riemann integrable or Lebesgue integrable. Since the user mentions Cauchy-Schwarz, which in the context of integrals usually refers to the Hölder's inequality or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in L² space, it implies that the functions are square-integrable. However, the problem as stated doesn't explicitly require square-integrability, just the absolute integrability. So maybe the minimal assumption is that f and g are integrable on [a, b]. \n\nAnother point is whether the interval [a, b] is closed and bounded. Since it's a standard integral from a to b, we can assume a and b are real numbers with a ≤ b. \n\nSo compiling the assumptions: f and g are integrable on [a, b], the interval is [a, b] where a and b are real numbers, and perhaps that the integral is in the Riemann sense unless specified otherwise. But the problem as written doesn't specify these details, so we need to extract only what's necessary from the question. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions on f and g beyond being part of the integral, so the main assumptions are that f and g are integrable on [a, b]. \n\nThe problem is to prove the given inequality. The user also asks if this follows from Cauchy-Schwarz. However, in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" section should just state what needs to be proved. The assumptions are the conditions required for the problem to hold. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is an inequality that generally holds under the conditions that f and g are integrable on [a, b]. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- f is integrable on [a, b]\n- g is integrable on [a, b]\n- a and b are real numbers with a ≤ b\n\nBut the original question doesn't explicitly state these; they are implicit in the problem. Since the user didn't mention any specific properties beyond the functions being integrated, those are the standard assumptions needed for the integral to exist. \n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function integrable on [a, b].\n2. g is a function integrable on [a, b].\n3. a and b are real numbers with a ≤ b.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the absolute value of the integral of f(x)g(x) from a to b is less than or equal to the integral of the absolute values of f(x) and g(x) over the same interval.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So splitting into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n- f is integrable on [a, b]\n- g is integrable on [a, b]\n- a and b are real numbers with a ≤ b\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\left| \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) g(x) \\ dx \\right| \\leq \\int_{a}^{b} |f(x)|\\cdot |g(x)| \\ dx$$\n\nThis should be correct. The user didn't mention any specific constraints on f and g beyond their integrability, so those are the key assumptions. The interval [a, b] being a real interval with a ≤ b is also necessary for the integral to be defined.",
