    "Content": "How does one know that a number field $K$ has a maximal abelian extension (unique up to isomorphism) $K^{\\text{ab}}$? I've read proofs involving Zorn's lemma that it has an algebraic closure (And that algebraic closures are unique up to isomorphism.) $\\bar{K}$ All these proofs involved ideals of the polynomial ring in variables $x_f$, $f$ an irreducible monic polynomial in $K[x]$, but I don't see any obvious way of \"restricting\" this proof to abelian extensions. I tried proving that such an extension exists using Zorn's lemma:  Let $\\Sigma$ be the set of all abelian subgroups of $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{K}/K)$ partially ordered by inclusion.  Any chain of subgroups $(G_\\alpha)$ has an upper bound, namely, $\\bigcup_\\alpha G_\\alpha$ (which is a [sub]group as each $G_\\alpha$ is contained in another), so by Zorn's lemma $\\Sigma$ has a maximal element.  But I don't have that this element is unique. (and I don't think I proved that $\\bigcup_\\alpha G_\\alpha$ is abelian, either). Additionally, how does $\\text{Gal}(K^\\text{ab}/K)$ relate to $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{K}/K)$ ?  My incomplete attempt at a Zorn's lemme proof doesn't tell me what the maximal abelian galois group should be, and I don't know many ways of finding abelian subgroups.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Existence: It's not hard to check that a compositum of abelian extensions is again abelian (the Galois group of the compositum embeds into the product of the individual Galois groups) and the maximal abelian extension of $K$ is precisely the compositum of all such extensions.  Once you've constructed an algebraic closure, you don't have to worry about working directly with minimal polynomials. Relation to $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{K}/K)$ :  As mentioned in the comments, the Galois group of the maximal abelian extension is just the abelianization of the absolute Galois group.  Note that this abelianization process can be trivial (though not for number fields) -- if you start with a finite field, or $\\mathbb{R}$, its algebraic closure is already an abelian extension. What it looks like: Remarkably, this is a largely wide open question, and I'll just briefly reference you to the whole branch of number theory known as class field theory .  When $K=\\mathbb{Q}$, the answer is completely understood (but fairly non-trivial):  The maximal abelian extension is the field obtained by adjoining all roots of unity to $\\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., the splitting field of the set of polynomials $x^n-1$ for all $n\\geq 1$.  The Galois group is precisely $\\prod \\mathbb{Z}_p^\\times$, where the product ranges over all primes $p$.  (Note this is an uncountable group).  There's also an explicit version of such a statement in the case that $K$ is quadratic imaginary, where the maximal extension is obtained by adjoining special values of functions defined on elliptic curves.  Beyond those two cases, the state of the art ranges from fairly explicit conjectures (e.g., Stark conjectures for totally real fields, in particular real quadratic fields) to completely unknown.  That said, there's lots of neat stuff known about these fields and their Galois groups which falls shy of an explicit construction, but I suspect they lie beyond the scope of the answer you were looking for.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and identify the key components: assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original question is about the existence and uniqueness of a maximal abelian extension of a number field K, denoted as K^ab, and understanding its Galois group. The user mentions using Zorn's lemma but is unsure about the details, particularly uniqueness and the structure of the Galois group.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions. The problem is in the context of number fields, so K is a number field. The user is trying to apply Zorn's lemma to the set of abelian subgroups of Gal(¯K/K), ordered by inclusion. However, they have issues with the union of a chain of abelian subgroups being abelian, which is necessary for Zorn's lemma. Also, they are interested in how Gal(K^ab/K) relates to Gal(¯K/K).\n\nThe key assumptions here would be:\n1. K is a number field. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n2. The algebraic closure ¯K exists and is unique up to isomorphism. (The user references proofs involving Zorn's lemma for algebraic closures.)\n3. The set of abelian extensions of K is considered. (The problem is about maximal abelian extension.)\n4. The maximal abelian extension K^ab should be unique up to isomorphism. (The user mentions uniqueness in the title.)\n5. The Galois group Gal(K^ab/K) is abelian. (Since it's an abelian extension.)\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking about existence and uniqueness of K^ab, so maybe some assumptions are part of the problem's setup. Let me parse again.\n\nThe user's problem is twofold: existence of K^ab (using Zorn's lemma) and understanding its Galois group. The assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem. The user starts by asking how one knows that K has a maximal abelian extension, unique up to isomorphism. Then they mention using Zorn's lemma on abelian subgroups of Gal(¯K/K). However, their approach might have flaws, like the union of a chain of abelian subgroups not necessarily being abelian.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n- K is a number field.\n- The existence of an algebraic closure ¯K for K, which is unique up to isomorphism.\n- The use of Zorn's lemma on the set of abelian subgroups of Gal(¯K/K), ordered by inclusion.\n- The problem of whether the union of a chain of abelian subgroups remains abelian.\n- The relation between Gal(K^ab/K) and Gal(¯K/K).\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were specific to the problem's conditions. For the current problem, the user is trying to apply Zorn's lemma but is facing issues. However, the problem statement itself is about existence and uniqueness of K^ab and the structure of its Galois group. So perhaps the assumptions are the given premises, not the user's incorrect steps.\n\nWait, the format requires listing the assumptions of the problem, not the user's attempts. So the original problem's assumptions. The problem is about a number field K, so that's an assumption. The existence of algebraic closure is known, but the problem is about maximal abelian extension. So assumptions would be:\n\n- K is a number field.\n- The concept of algebraic closure applies to K.\n- Abelian extensions are considered in the context of Galois theory.\n- Maximal abelian extension is defined as the compositum of all finite abelian extensions of K.\n\nBut the user's question is asking how to show existence and uniqueness, so perhaps the problem's assumptions are minimal. The key points from the problem are:\n\nHow does one know that K has a maximal abelian extension (unique up to isomorphism) K^ab? Also, how does Gal(K^ab/K) relate to Gal(¯K/K)?\n\nSo the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- K is a number field.\n- There exists an algebraic closure ¯K of K.\n- The maximal abelian extension K^ab is considered within the algebraic closure.\n\nBut maybe the user is assuming standard results in number theory, like the existence of maximal abelian extensions via class field theory. However, since the user is trying to use Zorn's lemma directly, perhaps the problem is set in the context of using Zorn's lemma for field extensions, similar to algebraic closures.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had specific assumptions about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more theoretical. Let me structure it accordingly.\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is a number field.\n- The algebraic closure of K, denoted ¯K, exists.\n- The compositum of all abelian extensions of K within ¯K is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that K has a maximal abelian extension K^{ab} (unique up to isomorphism) and describe the structure of Gal(K^{ab}/K) in relation to Gal(¯K/K).\n\nWait, but the original question is asking how to know that K has a maximal abelian extension, and how the Galois group relates. The user tried using Zorn's lemma on abelian subgroups but had issues. So perhaps the problem is:\n\nProblem: Prove that a number field K has a maximal abelian extension K^{ab} (unique up to isomorphism), and determine the structure of Gal(K^{ab}/K) in relation to Gal(¯K/K).\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as \"How does one know that...\" and \"how does Gal...\", so maybe the problem is:\n\nProblem: How does one prove that a number field K has a maximal abelian extension K^{ab} (unique up to isomorphism), and how is Gal(K^{ab}/K) related to Gal(¯K/K)?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\", so perhaps rephrase the problem as a statement to prove.\n\nAlternatively, the user's problem is asking for an explanation of the existence and uniqueness of K^{ab} and the structure of its Galois group. So the assumptions are the given conditions (K is a number field, etc.), and the problem is to show existence, uniqueness, and describe the Galois group.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a number field,\n$\\bar{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K$,\nAbelian extensions of $K$ are considered within $\\bar{K}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $K$ has a maximal abelian extension $K^{\\text{ab}}$ (unique up to isomorphism), and describe the structure of $\\text{Gal}(K^{\\text{ab}}/K)$ in relation to $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{K}/K)$.\n\nBut I need to check if the assumptions are each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$K$ is a number field,\n$\\bar{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K$,\nAbelian extensions of $K$ are considered as subfields of $\\bar{K}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a maximal abelian extension $K^{\\text{ab}}$ of $K$ (unique up to isomorphism), and describe the relationship between $\\text{Gal}(K^{\\text{ab}}/K)$ and $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{K}/K)$.\n\nYes, this seems to capture the core. The user's attempt with Zorn's lemma is part of their approach, but the problem itself is about existence, uniqueness, and Galois group structure.",
