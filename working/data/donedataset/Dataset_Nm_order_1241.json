    "Content": "Let $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$ an irrational number. Define $X=\\{nx-\\lfloor nx\\rfloor: n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Prove that $X$ is dense on $[0,1)$. Can anyone give some hint to solve this problem? I tried contradiction but could not reach a proof. I spend part of the day studying this question Positive integer multiples of an irrational mod 1 are dense and its answers. Only one answer is clear and give clues to solve the problem. This answer is the first one. However, this answer does not answer the question nor directly, nor the proof follows from this answer. This answer has some mistakes, he use that $[(k_1-k_2)\\alpha]=[k_1\\alpha]-[k_2\\alpha]$ which is not true. Consider $k_1=3, k_2=1, \\alpha=\\sqrt{2}$ we have $[(k_1-k_2)\\alpha]=2\\not= 3=[k_1\\alpha]-[k_2\\alpha] $. We only can assure that $[k_2\\alpha]-[k_1\\alpha]-1\\leq [(k_2-k_1)\\alpha]\\leq[k_2\\alpha]-[k_1\\alpha]$. Who answered said something interesting about additive subgroups of $\\mathbb{R}$, but unfortunately the set $X=\\{nx-[nx] : n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ is not a subgroup. Considering the additive subgroup $G=\\langle X \\rangle$, if we prove the part (a) of the link, we get that indeed $G$ is dense on $\\mathbb{R}$ but we can not conclude that $X$ is dense on $[0,1)$. I think this problem has not been solved. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Ok, since you've asked and it doesn't fit into a comment, there you go. I'll do it on a circle since it's slightly easier to explain and I'll leave it to you to complete it in the case of an interval. let's say you have a circle of length $1$. you take 'steps' along the circle of an irrational length, let's say counter-clockwise. you'll never hit the same spot twice so for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$ you'll eventually find two 'steps' $a_n$ and $a_m$ such that $0 < |a_n - a_m| < \\epsilon$. the distance from $a_n$ to $a_m$ is the same as between $a_{n-m}$ and $a_0 = 0$ and so on. therefore if you let $k:= n-m$ and you only consider each $k$-th step you'll be going around the circle travelling a distance smaller than $\\epsilon$ hence if you divide your circle into arcs of equal lengths greater than $\\epsilon$ (but just slightly, say smaller than $2 \\epsilon$) you'll have to land in each one of those in order to make your way all around the circle (because your steps are to small to jump over them). Every point of the circle is in at least one of those intervals which means that for each point of the circle you can find a number $a_j$ in your sequence that is closer than $2 \\epsilon$ to it. Now conclude taking smaller and smaller $\\epsilon$'s. edit: oh, just note that I'm taking the distance along the circle, not the euclidean one",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to prove that for an irrational number x, the set X = {nx - floor(nx) | n ∈ ℕ} is dense in [0,1). They mentioned trying contradiction but didn't get far, and they looked at another related question but found issues with the answers provided there.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a set to be dense in [0,1). That means that in any open interval within [0,1), no matter how small, there's at least one element from X. So for any ε > 0 and any point y in [0,1), there exists some n ∈ ℕ such that |(nx - floor(nx)) - y| < ε.\n\nThe user referenced another question about additive subgroups of ℝ, but points out that X itself isn't a subgroup. However, the subgroup generated by X, G = ⟨X⟩, might still be useful. The key point from the linked answer seems to be that if you can show G is dense, then maybe X is dense. But the user is correct that G being dense doesn't directly imply X is dense. For example, G could be dense even if X isn't, because G includes all integer linear combinations of elements of X. So we need a different approach.\n\nI remember something about equidistribution or maybe using the pigeonhole principle. Since x is irrational, the fractional parts {nx} (which is nx - floor(nx)) don't repeat periodically. The pigeonhole principle might help here: if you divide [0,1) into m subintervals, then by considering more than m terms of the sequence {nx}, two of them must fall into the same subinterval. The difference between these two terms would then give a value in X that's within 1/m of some point. But this gives a way to find elements of X that are arbitrarily close to each other, which could be used to approximate any y in [0,1).\n\nWait, but how does that work exactly? Suppose we take n and m such that {nx} and {mx} are in the same subinterval. Then their difference {nx} - {mx} would be close to an integer, right? But since x is irrational, the difference (n - m)x is also irrational. The fractional part of (n - m)x would then be in X. But this requires that (n - m) is a positive integer, which it would be if n > m. So the fractional part {(n - m)x} would be in X and close to 0 or 1. But if we can get fractional parts arbitrarily close to 0, then by adding them up, we can reach any point in [0,1). That seems like the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Dirichlet's approximation theorem, which states that for any real number α and any positive integer N, there exist integers p and q with 1 ≤ q ≤ N such that |α - p/q| < 1/(qN). But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that the sequence {nx} is uniformly distributed modulo 1 when x is irrational. This is a result from equidistribution theory. If the sequence is uniformly distributed, then it's certainly dense. But proving uniform distribution might be more involved than needed for this problem. The user is asking for a hint, so maybe a simpler approach exists.\n\nGoing back to the pigeonhole principle: divide [0,1) into m intervals of equal length. Consider the first m+1 terms of the sequence {x}, {2x}, ..., {(m+1)x}. By the pigeonhole principle, two of these must fall into the same interval. Let's say {ix} and {jx} are in the same interval, where i > j. Then the difference {ix} - {jx} = {(i - j)x} - k for some integer k, which implies {(i - j)x} is within 1/m of {ix} - {jx} + k. But since {ix} and {jx} are in the same interval, their difference modulo 1 is less than 1/m. Therefore, {(i - j)x} is within 1/m of 0 or 1, but since it's in [0,1), it's within 1/m of 0. So we get that there exists an n = i - j such that {nx} < 1/m. By choosing m large enough, we can make {nx} as small as we like. Then, by adding these small increments repeatedly, we can reach any point in [0,1). For example, if we have a term {nx} = δ, then {2nx} = 2δ mod 1, {3nx} = 3δ mod 1, etc., which will densely fill the interval as δ becomes very small.\n\nThis seems like a plausible path. The key steps are using the pigeonhole principle to find arbitrarily small δ = {nx}, then using multiples of δ to approximate any y in [0,1). Since δ can be made as small as desired, the multiples will eventually come within δ of any point. However, we need to ensure that δ is indeed approaching zero and that the multiples can cover the interval without gaps. This might require some more detailed argument, perhaps using the Archimedean property.\n\nBut the user mentioned that in the linked answer, someone used an incorrect property about the floor function. The mistake was claiming that floor((k1 - k2)x) = floor(k1x) - floor(k2x), which isn't true. So we have to be careful with how we handle the differences. However, in the pigeonhole approach, we're looking at the fractional parts {ix} and {jx}, which are (ix - floor(ix)) and (jx - floor(jx)). The difference between these two is (i - j)x - (floor(ix) - floor(jx)). The fractional part of (i - j)x is then equal to either {ix} - {jx} or {ix} - {jx} + 1, depending on whether {ix} ≥ {jx} or not. But since {ix} and {jx} are in the same interval, the difference {ix} - {jx} is between -1/m and 1/m. Therefore, the fractional part of (i - j)x is either close to 0 or close to 1, but since we take modulo 1, it's equivalent to being close to 0. Hence, we can find a term in X that is within 1/m of 0. By increasing m, we make this term as small as needed.\n\nOnce we have such a δ = {nx} < ε, then considering the multiples kδ mod 1 for k = 1, 2, ..., ceiling(1/ε) will cover the interval [0,1) with steps smaller than ε. Therefore, any y in [0,1) will be within ε of some kδ. Hence, X is dense.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n1. Use the pigeonhole principle to find two terms {ix} and {jx} in the same subinterval.\n2. Consider their difference to get a term {nx} with n = i - j, which is very small.\n3. Use multiples of this small term to approximate any y in [0,1).\n\nThis approach avoids the incorrect step the user mentioned, as we're not assuming linearity of the floor function, but rather working directly with the fractional parts and their differences.\n\nI think this is the correct way to go. The user's original approach via contradiction might not have led them here, but using the pigeonhole principle to find increasingly small increments and then building up from there seems solid. They should be careful to formalize the argument, showing that for any ε and y, there exists a multiple k such that k{nx} mod 1 is within ε of y. Since {nx} is irrational (because x is irrational and n is a positive integer), the multiples won't repeat and will densely fill the interval.",
