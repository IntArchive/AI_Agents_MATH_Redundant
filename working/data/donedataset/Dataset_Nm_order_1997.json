    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving an integral identity involving a logarithmic function and an elliptic integral. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the problem. The example provided shows that each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me look at the problem again.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to π of [ln(2 + cosφ)/sqrt(2 + cosφ)] dφ, and it's conjectured to equal (ln3)/sqrt3 times K(sqrt(2/3)), where K is the complete elliptic integral of the 1st kind. The user is asking how to prove this identity.\n\nNow, assumptions. The problem states that the integral equals a specific expression involving K. So, what are the assumptions here? Let's break it down.\n\n1. The integral is taken over the interval [0, π]. So, the variable φ ranges from 0 to π.\n2. The integrand is [ln(2 + cosφ)] / sqrt(2 + cosφ). So, the function inside the integral has this form.\n3. The right-hand side involves K(x), which is defined as the complete elliptic integral of the 1st kind, given here in terms of the hypergeometric function _2F_1. So, the definition of K(x) is as per equation (2).\n\nAre there any other implicit assumptions? Maybe about the parameters of the elliptic integral. The argument given is sqrt(2/3), which is a positive real number less than 1 (since sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816, which is valid for the elliptic integral's domain). So perhaps assuming that x is within the domain where K(x) is defined. But since the problem states K(sqrt(2/3)), maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The original problem doesn't specify any constraints on φ beyond the interval, but the integrand must be defined there. Since 2 + cosφ is between 1 and 3 (because cosφ ranges from -1 to 1, so 2 + cosφ ranges from 1 to 3), so the argument inside the log and sqrt is always positive, so the functions are defined. So maybe that's an assumption: 2 + cosφ is positive over [0, π], which it is. But perhaps the user expects explicit assumptions. Wait, in the example given, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted assumption included it. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem under \"assumption\" listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here? Because in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually changes the problem. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the example provided, the original problem is stated as \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem as formatted is actually changing the original problem's statement. Because the original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrectly formatted. Therefore, perhaps the user wants me to extract assumptions from the problem as stated, not to add new ones. So in this case, the problem is to prove the integral equals that expression. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. Since the problem is to prove the identity, the assumptions would include the domain of integration, the form of the integrand, and the definition of K(x). But since the problem is stated as a conjecture (with the question mark and \"stackrel?=\"), the user is asking how to prove it, so the assumptions are the components of the problem. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption 1: The integral is from 0 to π.\n\nAssumption 2: The integrand is [ln(2 + cosφ)] / sqrt(2 + cosφ) with respect to φ.\n\nAssumption 3: K(x) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, defined as in equation (2).\n\nSo those would be the key components. The problem is to prove the equality between the integral and the given expression involving K.\n\nWait, but the original example had assumptions that included constraints on n, but in this problem, there are no variables with constraints except φ which is integrated over [0, π]. So maybe the assumptions here are just the structure of the integral and the definition of K(x). Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that certain properties of the elliptic integral are known, but that's more about background knowledge than stated assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that 2 + cosφ is positive over [0, π], which it is, but since it's always positive (as cosφ >= -1, so 2 + cosφ >=1), maybe that's an assumption. But the problem as stated doesn't mention that, it's inherent in the integral's definition. So perhaps the key assumptions are the integral's limits and the form of the integrand, as well as the definition of K(x).\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over φ from 0 to π,\nThe integrand is [ln(2 + cosφ)] / sqrt(2 + cosφ),\nK(x) is defined as (π/2) times the hypergeometric function _2F_1(1/2, 1/2; 1; x²).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals (ln3)/sqrt3 times K(sqrt(2/3)).\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. The first assumption is about the integral's limits, the second about the integrand, the third about the definition of K(x). The problem is to prove the equality.",
