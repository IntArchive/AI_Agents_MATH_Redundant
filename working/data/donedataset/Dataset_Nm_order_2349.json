    "Content": "Let $\\pi \\colon P \\to B$ be a principal $G$-bundle and let $s \\colon B \\to P$ be it's smooth section. In order to show that $P \\simeq B \\times G$ I define the map $\\varphi \\colon P \\to B \\times G$ by the following rule:\n$$\n  \\varphi(p) = (\\pi(p),g(p))\n$$\nwhere $g(p) \\in G$ is such that $p = s(\\pi(p))g(p)$ (it always exists since the right action of $G$ is transitive on each fiber and it is unique since the action is free on each fiber).

    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is simpler to prove smoothness of the inverse map $$G\\times B\\to P,\\quad(g,b)\\mapsto s(b)\\cdot g$$ The smoothness of the section and of the $G$-action on $P$ imply smoothness, and deduce smoothness of the map you are looking at from the inverse function theorem. One can also show, using the inverse function theorem, that the canonical map $$P\\times_B P\\to G, (p,q)\\mapsto g$$ (where $q=p\\cdot g$) is smooth (using the inverse function theorem) and deduce the result you are interested in from there.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user is trying to prove that a principal G-bundle with a smooth global section is trivial by constructing an explicit isomorphism and then showing it's smooth. The main issue here is verifying the smoothness of the map φ they've defined.\n\nFirst, let me recall the setup. A principal G-bundle π: P → B has a smooth section s: B → P. They define φ: P → B×G by φ(p) = (π(p), g(p)), where g(p) is the unique element in G such that p = s(π(p))·g(p). They've already checked that φ is a bijection and equivariant, but need to show smoothness.\n\nHmm, to show φ is smooth, I need to consider the smooth structures on P and B×G. Since φ is defined using the section s and the group action, I should check the smoothness of the map p ↦ g(p). But how exactly is g(p) determined? Since the right action is free and transitive on fibers, for each p, there's a unique g(p) such that p = s(π(p))·g(p). So g(p) is the result of the translation between s(π(p)) and p in the fiber.\n\nIn the context of principal bundles, the translation function is often smooth. Let me think. If we have a local trivialization, then the coordinate functions are smooth. But here, we have a global section, so maybe we can use that to define a global trivialization.\n\nAlternatively, since s is a smooth section, and the action of G on P is smooth, then the map taking p to g(p) should be smooth. Wait, the group action is a smooth map P×G → P. If we fix p, then the map G → P given by g ↦ s(π(p))·g is an embedding. Since the action is free and transitive on fibers, the inverse of this map, which sends p ↦ g(p), should be smooth. But how to formalize this?\n\nIn differential geometry, if the action is free and proper, then the quotient map is a submersion, but here we already have a section. Maybe we can use the implicit function theorem. Since s is smooth, and the action is smooth, the map (b, g) ↦ s(b)·g is a diffeomorphism from B×G to P. Wait, but that's essentially what we're trying to prove. So maybe φ is the inverse of this map.\n\nIf we define Φ: B×G → P by Φ(b, g) = s(b)·g, then Φ is smooth because s and the action are smooth. The user's φ is supposed to be the inverse of Φ. Since Φ is a bijection (because the section exists and the action is free and transitive), φ is Φ^{-1}. If Φ is a diffeomorphism, then φ is smooth. But to show Φ is a diffeomorphism, we need to show that its inverse is smooth, which is φ. So we need to show φ is smooth.\n\nBut how to do that without circular reasoning? Maybe use the fact that Φ is a bijective local diffeomorphism, hence a diffeomorphism. Alternatively, since s is smooth and the action is smooth, we can locally express g(p) in terms of the group multiplication and inversion, which are smooth.\n\nAlternatively, in local coordinates, suppose we take a trivialization around a point b in B. But wait, since we have a global section, the bundle is trivial, so locally, the section s(b) would correspond to (b, e) in B×G, and then p = s(b)·g would correspond to (b, g). So in this case, the map φ is just projecting to the group component. But globally, since we have a section, this should hold everywhere.\n\nAnother angle: the map φ can be written as φ = (π, g), where g: P → G is smooth. To show g is smooth, note that in the trivialization Φ: B×G → P, we have Φ^{-1}(p) = (π(p), g(p)), so if Φ is smooth and invertible with smooth inverse, then g is smooth. But Φ is smooth, bijective, and its inverse φ is the map we need to show is smooth. However, in differential geometry, a bijective smooth map doesn't necessarily have a smooth inverse unless it's a diffeomorphism. So we need to verify that φ is smooth, perhaps by using the fact that the action is proper and free, making Φ a diffeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a principal bundle, the existence of a global smooth section implies that the bundle is trivializable. This is a standard result, and the trivialization is given precisely by the map Φ as above. Therefore, the inverse map φ must be smooth because Φ is a diffeomorphism. However, the user wants to explicitly show φ is smooth without appealing to this theorem, perhaps.\n\nBreaking it down, since s is smooth and the action is smooth, the map Ψ: P → G defined by Ψ(p) = g(p) such that p = s(π(p))·g(p) should be smooth. Let's see: For each p, Ψ(p) is the unique g where s(π(p))·g = p. If we can write this as a composition of smooth maps, then Ψ is smooth.\n\nConsider the map f: P → P×B P (fiber product) given by p ↦ (p, s(π(p))). Then, since the action is smooth, the map (p, q) ↦ the unique g such that q·g = p. This is called the translation map, and it's known in principal bundles that this translation map is smooth. Therefore, Ψ is the composition of p ↦ (p, s(π(p))) followed by the translation map, hence smooth.\n\nYes, in principal bundles, the translation map τ: P×B P → G defined by τ(p, q) = g where p = q·g is smooth. Therefore, since s is a smooth section, the composition p ↦ (p, s(π(p))) ↦ τ(p, s(π(p))) = g(p) is smooth. Thus, Ψ = g(p) is smooth, so φ = (π, Ψ) is smooth because both components are smooth.\n\nTherefore, the key points are that the section s is smooth, the translation map is smooth, and their composition gives the smoothness of g(p). Hence, φ is smooth.",
