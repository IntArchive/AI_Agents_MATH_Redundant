    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem according to the given example.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving an integral equals pi. The user provided their own solution using substitution steps, but they're asking for alternative methods. My task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement in the specified format.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this integral problem, I need to check if there are any implicit assumptions.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity of the square root of (1/sqrt(e^x) - 1/e^x) dx. Let's analyze the integrand. The expression inside the square root must be non-negative for the function to be real. So, I need to verify when sqrt(e^(-x/2)) - e^(-x) is non-negative. Let's compute that:\n\nsqrt(e^(-x/2)) is e^(-x/4), so the integrand becomes sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) = sqrt(e^{-x/2}(1 - e^{-x/2})). Wait, actually, the original integrand is sqrt(1/sqrt(e^x) - 1/e^x). Let's simplify:\n\n1/sqrt(e^x) is e^{-x/2}, and 1/e^x is e^{-x}. So inside the square root, we have e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}. To ensure this is non-negative: e^{-x/2} - e^{-x} ≥ 0 ⇒ e^{-x/2} ≥ e^{-x} ⇒ -x/2 ≥ -x ⇒ x/2 ≤ x ⇒ x ≥ 0. Since the integral is from 0 to infinity, x is always non-negative. Therefore, the integrand is real and defined for all x in [0, ∞). So the main assumption here is about the domain of integration and the integrand being real.\n\nBut the example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\", etc. Here, the problem is an integral over [0, ∞), so maybe the assumptions are that the integrand is defined (which it is for x ≥ 0), and perhaps the convergence of the integral. But the problem doesn't state any explicit constraints; it's given as is. However, to structure it properly, perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges, or that the integrand is real-valued over the interval. But since the user didn't mention any specific conditions beyond the integral setup, maybe the only assumption is the domain of integration and the integrand's validity there.\n\nBut in the example, they listed assumptions even if they were part of the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the example might have a typo or perhaps was from a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. But the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was a bad one, or perhaps the user intended to show that even if the original problem says for every integer, the formatted problem adds an extra assumption? That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user wants me to follow the structure regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, there was a mistake, but the user wants me to extract assumptions from the problem as given. So, in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}). The only assumptions here are that x is a real variable in [0, ∞), and the integrand is real and defined there. But since the problem is stated as is, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. However, sometimes in integrals, convergence is an assumption. The problem states to prove the integral equals pi, so we assume the integral converges. Therefore, the assumption could be that the integral converges. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute the integral, maybe the main assumption is that the integral exists (converges).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. So for this integral problem, the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. So the assumptions might be:\n\n- The variable x is real and in the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand is real-valued and defined for all x in [0, ∞).\n\nBut since the problem is stated as is, maybe the only assumption is that the integral is convergent. However, in the example, the assumption was about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". That seems inconsistent. Perhaps the example is flawed, but I should proceed with the current problem.\n\nLooking at the problem again: \"Prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of sqrt(1/sqrt(e^x) - 1/e^x) dx equals pi.\" So the main assumption here is that the integral is well-defined, i.e., the integrand is real and the integral converges. But in the problem statement, the user has already written the integral as being equal to pi, so perhaps the task is to verify that. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integrand sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) is real for all x ≥ 0.\n- The integral converges.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove the integral equals pi, the assumptions needed are that the integrand is real (which it is for x ≥ 0) and the integral converges (which the user's solution shows it does, resulting in pi). However, when structuring the problem, perhaps we only list the necessary assumptions for the problem to make sense. So, the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is defined there. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval [0, ∞).\n- The integrand sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) is real for all x in [0, ∞).\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention these; they are implicit. However, in the example, the assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So, following that pattern, here the assumptions would include the domain of integration and the integrand's validity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example had a mistake, but the user wants me to list assumptions based on the problem. Since the problem is to compute the integral, and the user's solution involves substitutions, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond what's given. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but according to the format, we need to list them. However, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. So, perhaps in this case, the assumption is that the integral is taken over [0, ∞), and the integrand is as defined.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the integral is already from 0 to infinity, so maybe that's part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption. So perhaps any conditions on the variables (like n being integer) are listed as assumptions. Here, the variable x is integrated from 0 to infinity, but x is a dummy variable. So perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, which is necessary for the problem to hold true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup, and thus the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires listing assumptions. The example had two assumptions even when the original problem only stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user expects to break down all conditions. In this case, the integrand must be real and the integral must converge. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The expression inside the square root, e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}, is non-negative for all x ≥ 0.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) dx converges.\n\nBut checking the expression e^{-x/2} - e^{-x} ≥ 0:\n\nLet’s set y = e^{-x/2} (which is positive for all real x). Then the expression becomes y - y² = y(1 - y). Since y = e^{-x/2} and x ≥ 0, y ∈ (0,1]. Therefore, 1 - y ≥ 0 when y ≤ 1, which is always true here. So y(1 - y) ≥ 0 for y ∈ (0,1], which is the case here. Hence, the expression inside the sqrt is non-negative for all x ≥ 0, so the integrand is real. Therefore, this is an assumption that holds due to the domain of x.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn’t mention this; it's inherent in the integral's limits. So perhaps the assumption is that x is in [0, ∞), ensuring the integrand is real. Alternatively, since x is the variable of integration, the limits are part of the problem, not an assumption. This is a bit confusing.\n\nGiven the example provided, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumptions included \"n is an integer\", perhaps here the assumption is that x is a real variable in [0, ∞). But since the integral is already from 0 to ∞, maybe that's part of the problem statement. However, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that pattern, here the assumption would be that the integral is over x from 0 to ∞, but since that's part of the problem statement, perhaps it's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, and the correct approach is to list any implicit assumptions necessary for the problem to be valid. In this case, the integrand must be real, which it is for x ≥ 0, and the integral must converge. Since the problem asks to prove the integral equals pi, the convergence is assumed. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integrand sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) is real for all x ≥ 0.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x}) dx converges.\n\nBut these are more like justifications rather than assumptions. However, in mathematical problems, sometimes we take for granted that certain conditions hold. But following the example, perhaps we need to list them as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's given, and the problem is as stated. But the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe in this case, there are no additional assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement, so I should follow that.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The variable x is integrated from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand sqrt(e^{-x/2} - e^{-x} is real-valued for all x ≥ 0.\n\nBut the first is part of the problem's integral limits, and the second is a consequence of the integrand's expression. However, to align with the example, where assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem statement, I think the correct approach here is to list:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand is real-valued for all x in [0, ∞).\n\nBut since the integrand's reality is ensured by the domain of x, maybe just listing the domain as an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the example's first assumption was redundant, and here similarly, the assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to ∞, which is part of the problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond what's given, and thus the assumptions section is empty. But the format requires it, so perhaps the user expects at least something. Looking back at the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Maybe that example was incorrect, but I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the domain of integration and the reality of the integrand as assumptions, even though they are part of the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞,\nThe expression inside the square root is non-negative for all x ≥ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{e^x} } - \\frac{1}{e^x}} \\,\\mathrm dx = \\pi.$$\n\nThat seems reasonable.
