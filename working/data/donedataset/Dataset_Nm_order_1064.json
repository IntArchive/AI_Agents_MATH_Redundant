    "Content": "If $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers, and $56x = 65y$, prove that $x + y$ is divisible by $11$. I tried  taking the $\\gcd(56x,65y)$ using the Euclidean algorithm, but I got nowhere with it and do not know where to head.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Why not just $x+y=(56x-55x)+(66y-65y)=11(6y-5x)+(56x-65y)=11(6y-5x)$ (since $56x-65y=0$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that if 56x equals 65y, then x + y is divisible by 11, where x and y are natural numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions one by one, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem mentions that x and y are natural numbers, so that's one assumption. Then, the equation 56x = 65y is another condition. However, in the example provided, sometimes the assumptions include divisibility conditions, but here the main equation is given. The problem statement itself is to prove that x + y is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included both that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the original problem doesn't state any additional conditions on x and y beyond being natural numbers and satisfying 56x = 65y. So I need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition. So the first assumption is that x is a natural number, the second that y is a natural number, and the third that 56x = 65y. But maybe in the problem statement, x and y are both natural numbers, so perhaps combining them into one assumption? Wait, the example listed each assumption line by line, each for one object. So in the example, the first assumption is \"n is an integer\", the second is \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, perhaps \"x is a natural number\", \"y is a natural number\", and \"56x = 65y\". However, maybe the user wants each assumption to be a separate line even if they are about different objects. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Both apply to the same object n. Here, x and y are two different objects. So according to the example's structure, each assumption should apply to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a natural number,\ny is a natural number,\n56x = 65y.\n\nProblem: Prove that x + y is divisible by 11.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem statement had the equation with n, which was covered in the assumptions. Similarly here, the problem is to prove x + y divisible by 11 given those assumptions. So that should be correct. Let me also consider the original problem's wording. The user wrote the problem as \"If x and y are natural numbers, and 56x = 65y, prove that x + y is divisible by 11.\" So the assumptions are x and y are natural numbers (two separate conditions?) but since they are both natural numbers, maybe each is a separate assumption. Alternatively, \"x and y are natural numbers\" as a single assumption. However, in the example, \"n is an integer\" was one assumption, so perhaps here, each variable's condition is a separate assumption. But since x and y are both natural numbers, perhaps two separate lines: \"x is a natural number\", \"y is a natural number\". Then the third assumption is \"56x = 65y\". The problem is to prove x + y divisible by 11. That seems to fit the format. The example had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7. Here, two assumptions for x and y each being natural numbers, then the equation as the third assumption. So that should be correct. I think that's the right structure.",
