    "Content": "How does one show that $$\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n+k}{k}\\frac{1}{2^k}=2^{n}$$ for each nonnegative integer $n$ ? I tried using the Snake oil technique but I guess I am applying it incorrectly. With the snake oil technique we have $$F(x)= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left\\{\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n+k}{k}\\frac{1}{2^k}\\right\\}x^{n}.$$ I think I have to interchage the summation and do something. But I am not quite comfortable in interchanging the summation. Like after interchaging the summation will $$F(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\binom{n+k}{k}\\frac{1}{2^k}x^{n}?$$ Even if I continue with this I am unable to get the correct answer. How does one prove this using the Snake oil technique? A combinatorial proof is also welcome, as are other kinds of proofs.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $S_n:=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^n\\,\\binom{n+k}{k}\\,\\frac{1}{2^k}$ for every $n=0,1,2,\\ldots$.  Then, $$S_{n+1}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\\,\\binom{(n+1)+k}{k}\\,\\frac{1}{2^k}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\\,\\Biggl(\\binom{n+k}{k}+\\binom{n+k}{k-1}\\Biggr)\\,\\frac{1}{2^k}\\,.$$\nHence,\n$$S_{n+1}=\\left(S_n+\\binom{2n+1}{n+1}\\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\\right)+\\sum_{k=0}^n\\,\\binom{(n+1)+k}{k}\\,\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}\\,.$$\nThat is,\n$$S_{n+1}=S_n+\\frac{S_{n+1}}{2}+\\frac{1}{2^{n+2}}\\,\\Biggl(2\\,\\binom{2n+1}{n+1}-\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}\\Biggr)\\,.$$\nAs $$\\binom{2n+2}{n+1}=\\frac{2n+2}{n+1}\\,\\binom{2n+1}{n}=2\\,\\binom{2n+1}{n+1}\\,,$$\nwe deduce that $S_{n+1}=S_n+\\frac{S_{n+1}}{2}$, or\n$$S_{n+1}=2\\,S_{n}$$\nfor all $n=0,1,2,\\ldots$.  Because $S_0=1$, the claim follows. Combinatorial Argument The number of binary strings of length $2n+1$ with at least $n+1$ ones is clearly $2^{2n}$.  For $k=0,1,2,\\ldots,n$, the number of such strings whose $(n+1)$-st one is at the $(n+k+1)$-st position is $\\binom{n+k}{k}\\,2^{n-k}$.  The claim is now evident.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the identity involving a binomial coefficient sum. The user wants the assumptions and problem separated, with each assumption addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem statement says \"for each nonnegative integer n\". So the main assumption here is that n is a nonnegative integer. There's no mention of any other conditions like divisibility or specific ranges beyond nonnegative integers. The example given in the problem had an assumption about divisibility by 7, but in this case, there's no such condition. \n\nLooking at the problem again: \"How to show that the sum from k=0 to n of binomial(n+k, k) * 1/(2^k) equals 2^n for each nonnegative integer n?\" So the key assumption here is that n is a nonnegative integer. There's no additional constraints mentioned. The user might have tried using the snake oil method but got stuck, so maybe the problem is about applying generating functions correctly. But for the assumptions part, it's just about n being a nonnegative integer.\n\nSo the formatted assumption should be \"n is a nonnegative integer.\" Then the problem is to prove the given sum equals 2^n. Checking the example again, the original problem had assumptions listed line by line, each for one object. Since there's only one assumption here, it should be a single line. \n\nI don't see any other hidden assumptions here. The problem is straightforward in stating that n is a nonnegative integer, so that's the only condition needed. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that assumption and the problem statement as given.",
