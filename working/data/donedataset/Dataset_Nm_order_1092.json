    "Content": "The exponential function has the well-known power series representation/definition: $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$ And the natural logarithm has the less well-known power series representation/definition: $\\ln(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$ Let's for the purpose of this question pretend we have no previous concept of exponentials and logarithms: all we have are two power series called $e^x$ and $\\ln(x)$ and, just for the fun of it, we want to see if they are the inverse of one another. So we put one power series into the other: $\\ln(e^x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!} - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$ How does one prove, using only the above power series, any algebraic manipulation of the expression and any theorems pertaining to power series that do not require the anterior knowledge of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$, that this is x?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I enjoyed Christian's answer, and if you want the shortest proof starting from the series definitions, then that is the way to go.  But, like you, I was curious about this question because I like to manipulate power series, and because this problem ended up being harder than I thought it would be. Here is a solution that meets your requirements.  The only thing I have omitted is proving that exchanging the order of summation is valid when I do it below, which is probably not the part of the proof you are interested in. A few lemmas are needed, which I will list first.  The first two are well-known combinatorial identities, and I will omit the proofs.  I'll follow your approach, but I'll delay the expansion of $e^x$ a little bit longer than you did, because otherwise you get sums over an arbitrarily large number of variables, which end up being difficult to handle. Lemma 1 : For $m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $0 \\le m < n$ , $$ \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} k^m = 0 $$ The easiest way to prove this is with calculus, but it can be proven by induction on $m$ from the result that for $n \\ge 1$ , $$ \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} = 0 $$ which itself can be proven by induction on $n$ .  So, no calculus required. Lemma 2 : $$ \\sum_{n=k}^m \\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{m+1}{k+1} $$ This can also be proven by induction. Lemma 3 : $ e^x e^y = e^{x+y} $ Proof : This one is a lot easier than the main result.  Expand the right hand side using the series definition and the binomial theorem to get $$ e^{x+y} = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{(x + y)^m}{m!} = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\sum_{i=0}^m \\frac{1}{m!} \\binom{m}{i} x^i y^{m-i} = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_{m=i}^\\infty \\frac{x^i y^{m-i}}{i! (m-i)!} $$ Let $j=m-i$ and the sums become independent: $$ \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_{m=i}^\\infty \\frac{x^i y^{m-i}}{i! (m-i)!} = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^i y^j}{i!j!} = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^i}{i!} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^j}{j!} \\right) = e^x e^y $$ Lemma 4 : $ (e^x)^y = e^{xy} $ when $y$ is a nonnegative integer. Proof : This is obvious using Lemma 3. Main result : $ \\log(e^x) = x $ Proof : Apply the power series for the logarithm, then a binomial expansion, and then the power series for the exponential. $$ \\begin{align}\n\\log(e^x) &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} ( e^x - 1 )^n \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^{n-k} e^{kx} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^{n-k} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{k^m x^m}{m!} \\\\\n&= -\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^m}{m!} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k k^m \\\\\n&= -\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^m}{m!} a_m \\tag{1} \\label{1}\n\\end{align} $$ where $a_m$ has been defined as $$ a_m = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k k^m $$ Split the sum over $n$ into two parts, from $1$ to $m$ and from $m+1$ to $\\infty$ . $$ a_m = \\sum_{n=1}^m \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k k^m + \\sum_{n=m+1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k k^m $$ On the right, the summation over $k$ is zero by Lemma 1 because $n > m$ .  This gives us $$ a_m = \\sum_{n=1}^m \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k k^m \\label{2} \\tag{2} $$ In this expression, when $k \\ge 1$ , we can apply the identity $$ \\frac{1}{n} \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\label{3} \\tag{3} $$ Fortunately, the $k=0$ terms in \\eqref{2} are all zero because of the $k^m$ term (since we are only considering $a_m$ where $m \\ge 1$ ).  Dropping the $k=0$ terms, moving the summation over $n$ to the right, and applying \\eqref{3} in \\eqref{2}, we get $$ \\begin{align}\na_m &= \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^k k^m \\sum_{n=k}^m \\frac{1}{k} \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^k k^{m-1} \\sum_{n=k}^m \\binom{n-1}{k-1}\n\\end{align} $$ Applying Lemma 2 to the summation over $n$ gives $$ a_m = \\sum_{k=1}^m (-1)^k k^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} $$ This can be simplified by again applying Lemma 1.  However, note that Lemma 1 requires the $k=0$ terms, which we dropped earlier so that we could apply \\eqref{3}.  Now the $k=0$ term in the sum must be replaced by including $k=0$ in the sum and subtracting it outside the sum. $$ a_m = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k k^{m-1} \\binom{m}{k} \\right) - 0^{m-1} $$ Obviously this term on the right is zero when $m>1$ , but the $m=1$ case results in $0^0$ .  Here the appropriate convention is that $0^0=1$ .  (For example, when we expanded the exponential as $e^{kx} = \\sum_m k^m x^m/m!$ , the $m=0$ term is interpreted as $1$ even when $k=0$ .)  Since the $0^{m-1}$ term yields 0 for $m \\ne 1$ and 1 for $m=1$ , we can write this using the Kronecker delta as $\\delta_{m,1}$ . $$ a_m = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^m \\binom{m}{k} (-1)^k k^{m-1} \\right) - \\delta_{m,1}  $$ Now Lemma 1 can be applied again.  (Note that the conditions of the lemma are satisfied because $m-1 < m$ .)  This gives $ a_m = -\\delta_{m,1} $ .  Inserting this into $\\eqref{1}$ gives the final result, $$ \\log(e^x) = x $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified assumption and problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is about proving that the exponential function is the inverse of the natural logarithm using only their power series definitions. The user provided their own power series for e^x and ln(x), and they want to show that composing them gives x, without using prior knowledge of these functions.\n\nSo, the main goal here is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions and then the problem statement. The assumptions should be single conditions per line, each applied to one object. Let me break down the given information.\n\nThe power series for e^x is given as the sum from n=0 to infinity of x^n /n!. The natural logarithm's power series is sum from k=1 to infinity of (x-1)^k /k * (-1)^(k+1). The user wants to assume that these are the definitions, and that we have no prior knowledge of exponentials or logarithms. So any assumptions should reflect this.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n1. The exponential function is defined by its power series: e^x = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n!.\n2. The natural logarithm is defined by its power series: ln(x) = sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (x-1)^k /k ] (-1)^{k+1}.\n3. No prior knowledge of properties of e^x or ln(x) is assumed.\n4. Algebraic manipulations and theorems on power series that don't require prior knowledge of these functions are allowed.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition for one object. So maybe separate each definition into its own line. Also, the condition about not using prior knowledge is important. Also, the problem is to prove that composing ln(e^x) gives x using only these series.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe exponential function is defined as $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$,\nThe natural logarithm function is defined as $\\ln(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$,\nNo prior knowledge of properties of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$ is used,\nOnly algebraic manipulations and power series theorems not requiring prior knowledge of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$ are employed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\ln(e^x) = x$ using the given power series definitions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the composed function as ln(e^x) and wants to show it's equal to x. The assumptions need to list each condition. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing a single condition.\n\nSo here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponential function is defined by the power series $e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$.\n- The natural logarithm function is defined by the power series $\\ln(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$.\n- The proof must not use any prior knowledge of properties of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$.\n- The proof can use algebraic manipulations and theorems related to power series that do not require knowledge of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for the problem. Maybe in this case, the key assumptions are the definitions of e^x and ln(x) via their power series, and the restriction on not using prior knowledge. But the user also mentions \"any theorems pertaining to power series that do not require the anterior knowledge of e^x or ln(x)\". So perhaps these need to be split into separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two are the definitions, and the third is the restriction. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n$e^x$ is defined as $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$,\n$\\ln(x)$ is defined as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$,\nThe proof must not use properties of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$ beyond their power series definitions,\nOnly power series theorems that do not reference $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$ are allowed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\ln(e^x) = x$ using the given power series definitions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as bullet points, each on a separate line, each being a single condition. So each of these would be separate lines in the assumption section.\n\nAlso, need to check if the original problem mentions any specific conditions, like convergence radius or domain restrictions. The original question doesn't specify, but perhaps the power series for ln(x) converges for |x-1| < 1, so when composing ln(e^x), we need e^x to be within that radius. But the user hasn't specified that. However, in the problem statement, maybe that's considered part of the necessary theorems or manipulations. Since the user wants to avoid using prior knowledge, maybe the assumptions should include that x is within the domain where the composition converges. But the original problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps the user is assuming that it works out. Maybe the problem is stated without considering convergence, but in reality, one would need to assume that x is such that e^x -1 is within the radius of convergence for the logarithm series. But since the original question didn't specify, maybe we shouldn't include that unless it's part of the problem's hidden assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is formal, treating the power series purely algebraically without worrying about convergence. But the original question mentions \"theorems pertaining to power series\", which might include convergence. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we should leave that out unless necessary. The example given in the initial problem (about divisibility by 91) didn't include assumptions about n being positive or similar unless specified. So perhaps in this case, the main assumptions are the definitions and the restrictions on not using prior knowledge.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$e^x$ is defined by the power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$,\n$\\ln(x)$ is defined by the power series $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x - 1)^k}{k}(-1)^{k + 1}$,\nThe proof must not use properties of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$ outside their power series definitions,\nThe proof uses only algebraic manipulations and power series theorems independent of $e^x$ and $\\ln(x)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that substituting $e^x$ into the power series for $\\ln(x)$ yields $x$, i.e., $\\ln(e^x) = x$.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"How does one prove, using only the above power series, any algebraic manipulation of the expression and any theorems pertaining to power series that do not require the anterior knowledge of $e^x$ or $\\ln(x)$, that this is x?\" So the problem is to show that ln(e^x) = x using only those definitions and allowed theorems.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should capture that. The key assumptions are the definitions via power series and the restrictions on prior knowledge. So each of these is an assumption.
