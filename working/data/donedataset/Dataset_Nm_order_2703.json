    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that sin²(x) < sin(x²) for 0 < x < √(π/2). \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. We need to show that the square of the sine of x is less than the sine of x squared in the interval from 0 to the square root of π/2. The user mentioned that they tried to define a function f(x) = sin(x²) - sin²(x) and show that it's positive in that interval. They noted that f(0) = 0, so if f is increasing, then f(x) would stay positive. \n\nBut when they took the derivative, f’(x) = 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x), they couldn't see why this is greater than zero. Let me check their derivative. The derivative of sin(x²) is 2x cos(x²), which is correct. The derivative of sin²(x) is 2 sin(x) cos(x), which is sin(2x). So, the derivative f’(x) is indeed 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x). \n\nNow, the key is to show that 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x) > 0 in the interval 0 < x < √(π/2). Let me analyze this expression. Maybe we can compare the two terms: 2x cos(x²) and sin(2x). If we can show that 2x cos(x²) > sin(2x) in that interval, then the derivative is positive, and hence f is increasing, which would imply f(x) > 0 since f(0)=0.\n\nLet me consider substituting t = x, so we have 2t cos(t²) and sin(2t). Perhaps using some inequality like the Taylor series expansion or known inequalities such as sin(z) ≤ z for z ≥ 0. Wait, for z ≥ 0, sin(z) ≤ z. So, sin(2x) ≤ 2x. But here we have 2x cos(x²). So, if cos(x²) ≥ something, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, can we write the inequality as 2x cos(x²) > sin(2x). Let's factor out 2x: 2x [cos(x²) - (sin(2x))/(2x)] > 0. Since 2x is positive for x > 0, the inequality reduces to cos(x²) - (sin(2x))/(2x) > 0.\n\nNow, note that sin(2x)/(2x) is the sinc function, which is known to be less than or equal to 1 for all x ≠ 0, and it's decreasing on [0, π/2]. Since our interval for x is up to √(π/2), which is approximately 1.253, and 2x would go up to about 2.506. However, sin(2x)/(2x) is a function that starts at 1 when x approaches 0 and decreases as x increases. \n\nBut how does that compare to cos(x²)? Let's see. At x = 0, cos(0) = 1, and sin(0)/0 is 1, so cos(0) - sin(0)/(0) = 1 - 1 = 0. But we need to check for x > 0. Maybe we can show that cos(x²) ≥ sin(2x)/(2x) in the interval. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function g(x) = 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x). We need to show that g(x) > 0 for 0 < x < √(π/2). Let's compute the derivative of g(x) to see if it's increasing or decreasing. But maybe this complicates things. Let's instead try to manipulate the inequality.\n\nAnother approach: use the inequality sin(z) ≤ z for z ≥ 0. Here, sin(2x) ≤ 2x. So, substituting into the expression for g(x):\n\ng(x) = 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x) ≥ 2x cos(x²) - 2x = 2x (cos(x²) - 1)\n\nBut cos(x²) - 1 ≤ 0, so this gives g(x) ≥ 2x (cos(x²) - 1) which is non-positive. But that's not helpful because we need g(x) > 0. So, this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Taylor series expansion for cos(x²) and sin(2x). Let's expand both terms up to a few terms.\n\ncos(x²) = 1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ... \n\nsin(2x) = 2x - (2x)^3/6 + (2x)^5/120 - ... \n\nThen, 2x cos(x²) = 2x (1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ... ) = 2x - x^5 + x^9/12 - ... \n\nsin(2x) = 2x - (8x^3)/6 + (32x^5)/120 - ... = 2x - (4x^3)/3 + (4x^5)/15 - ... \n\nSo, subtracting sin(2x) from 2x cos(x²):\n\n2x cos(x²) - sin(2x) = [2x - x^5 + ...] - [2x - (4x^3)/3 + ...] = (2x - 2x) + (4x^3)/3 - x^5 + ... = (4x^3)/3 - x^5 + ... \n\nFor small x, the dominant term is (4x^3)/3, which is positive. So near zero, the derivative f’(x) is positive. But what about as x approaches √(π/2)? Let's compute the value at x = √(π/2):\n\nx² = π/2, so cos(x²) = cos(π/2) = 0. Then, 2x cos(x²) = 0. sin(2x) = sin(2√(π/2)). Let's compute 2√(π/2) = √(4π/2) = √(2π) ≈ 2.506. The sine of that is sin(2.506). Since π ≈ 3.1416, so 2.506 is less than π (≈3.1416), so it's in the interval (0, π) where sine is positive. sin(2.506) ≈ sin(2.5) ≈ 0.598. So, at x = √(π/2), the derivative f’(x) would be 0 - 0.598 ≈ -0.598 < 0. But the original problem states the interval up to x = √(π/2), but not including it. Wait, but the problem is to prove the inequality for 0 < x < √(π/2). If at x approaching √(π/2), the derivative becomes negative, then f(x) might start decreasing. But since f(0) = 0, and if f increases initially and then decreases, we need to check whether f(x) remains positive throughout.\n\nHmm, so maybe the approach of showing that f is increasing over the entire interval isn't valid, because the derivative becomes negative near the upper end. Therefore, perhaps the original approach is flawed. The user thought that if f is increasing, then f(x) > 0, but if f starts decreasing after some point, then f(x) could dip below zero. So, maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative approach: consider the inequality sin²(x) < sin(x²). Let's see for x in (0, √(π/2)). Let's consider substituting x² = t, so t ∈ (0, π/2). Then the inequality becomes sin²(√t) < sin(t). So, sin(t) - sin²(√t) > 0. Maybe this substitution complicates things. Alternatively, consider that for t ∈ (0, π/2), sin(t) is increasing. So, perhaps we can compare x² and sin²(x). Wait, the inequality is sin²(x) < sin(x²). So, since x² is greater than x for x >1, but our interval is up to x = √(π/2) ≈1.25. So, x² ranges from 0 to π/2 ≈1.5708. \n\nIn the interval x ∈ (0, √(π/2)), x² ∈ (0, π/2). Since sin is increasing on (0, π/2), then sin(x²) is increasing, and sin²(x) is also increasing. But how do they compare?\n\nAt x = 0, both are 0. Let's take x approaching 0. Using Taylor series: sin(x) ≈ x - x^3/6, so sin²(x) ≈ x² - x^4/3. sin(x²) ≈ x² - x^6/6. So, sin(x²) - sin²(x) ≈ (x² - x^6/6) - (x² - x^4/3) = x^4/3 - x^6/6 > 0 for small x. So near zero, the inequality holds.\n\nAt x = 1, sin²(1) ≈ (0.8415)^2 ≈0.708, and sin(1²)=sin(1)≈0.8415, so 0.708 <0.8415 holds.\n\nAt x approaching √(π/2) ≈1.253, x² approaches π/2≈1.5708. Then sin(x²) approaches sin(π/2)=1. And sin²(x) would be sin²(1.253). Let's compute sin(1.253): 1.253 radians is about 71.8 degrees. sin(1.253) ≈0.9511, so sin²(x)≈0.904. So 0.904 <1, which holds. Therefore, at the upper end, the inequality still holds. So maybe the function f(x) = sin(x²) - sin²(x) is always positive in (0, √(π/2)).\n\nBut how to formally prove it? The user tried using the derivative and got stuck. Let's consider another approach. Maybe compare the two functions sin(x²) and sin²(x) in terms of their growth rates.\n\nAlternatively, consider the inequality sin(x²) > sin²(x). Let's use the identity sin(a) - sin(b) = 2 cos((a + b)/2) sin((a - b)/2). Let me set a = x² and b = x. Then sin(x²) - sin(x) = 2 cos((x² + x)/2) sin((x² - x)/2). But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, for x in (0, √(π/2)), x² is in (0, π/2), and since sin is increasing there, so sin(x²) > sin(x) if x² > x, which is true for x >1. But for 0 < x <1, x² <x, so sin(x²) < sin(x). However, in the inequality, we have sin²(x) < sin(x²). For x in (0,1), sin(x²) < sin(x), but sin²(x) is (sin x)^2. Since sin x < x, so sin²x < x². But x² <x for x in (0,1), so sin²x <x² <x < sin x (wait, but sin x <x, so x <x is not true. Wait, no, sin x <x for x >0. So, in (0,1), sin x <x, so sin²x <x². But x² <x, so sin²x <x² <x. But sin(x²) <x², because x² is in (0,1), and sin(z) <z for z>0. So, sin(x²) <x². Therefore, sin²x <x² and sin(x²) <x². So, how can we compare sin²x and sin(x²)?\n\nWait, for x in (0,1), we have both sin²x and sin(x²) less than x², but which is smaller? Let's take x=0.5. Then sin(0.5)≈0.4794, so sin²(0.5)≈0.2298. sin(x²)=sin(0.25)≈0.2474. So sin²x≈0.2298 < sin(x²)≈0.2474. So in this case, the inequality holds. For x approaching 1, x=1, sin²(1)≈0.708, sin(1)≈0.8415. So 0.708 <0.8415 holds. For x approaching sqrt(pi/2)≈1.253, as before, it holds. So in the entire interval, the inequality holds. But how to prove it?\n\nAlternatively, consider the function h(x) = sin(x²) - sin²(x). We need to show h(x) >0 for 0 <x <sqrt(pi/2). We know h(0)=0. Let's compute the derivative h’(x) = 2x cos(x²) - 2 sin x cos x = 2x cos(x²) - sin(2x). If we can show that h’(x) >0 for 0 <x <c, and h’(x) <0 for c <x <sqrt(pi/2), but h(x) remains positive, then we are done. Alternatively, perhaps h(x) is always increasing? But at x approaching sqrt(pi/2), h’(x) becomes negative as shown earlier, so h(x) would increase to a maximum and then decrease. However, we need to ensure that even when it decreases, it doesn't drop below zero.\n\nAlternatively, since h(x) starts at zero, increases, and then might decrease, but at the upper limit x=sqrt(pi/2), h(x) is still positive (as computed earlier), then by continuity, h(x) remains positive throughout the interval.\n\nBut to formalize this, perhaps consider the minimum of h(x) in the interval. If we can show that h(x) has no zeros in (0, sqrt(pi/2)), then since h(x) is positive at x approaching sqrt(pi/2), and starts at zero, it must be positive throughout.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Taylor series expansion to approximate h(x) and show positivity. But this might be messy.\n\nAnother idea: compare the two terms sin(x²) and sin²(x). For x in (0, sqrt(pi/2)), x² is in (0, pi/2). Since sin is concave on (0, pi/2), we can use the inequality sin(a) > a sin(pi/2)/(pi/2) for a in (0, pi/2). Not sure. Alternatively, use the fact that for 0 < z < pi/2, sin(z) > 2z/pi. This is the Jordan's inequality. So, sin(x²) > 2x²/pi. Similarly, sin(x) <x, so sin²(x) <x². Therefore, sin(x²) > 2x²/pi and sin²(x) <x². So if 2x²/pi >x², then sin(x²) >x² > sin²(x). But 2x²/pi >x² would imply 2/pi >1, which is false since 2/pi ≈0.6366 <1. So this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider using the inequality sin(z) ≥ z - z^3/6 for z ≥0. For z in (0, pi/2), this holds because the Taylor series alternating and decreasing. So sin(z) ≥ z - z^3/6. Let's apply this to sin(x²):\n\nsin(x²) ≥ x² - (x²)^3/6 = x² - x^6/6.\n\nAnd sin²(x) can be written as (sin x)^2 ≤x^2, since sin x ≤x. But we need a better lower bound for sin(x²) and upper bound for sin²(x).\n\nAlternatively, use the identity sin²x = (1 - cos(2x))/2. So, the inequality becomes sin(x²) > (1 - cos(2x))/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 2 sin(x²) >1 - cos(2x). Then, 2 sin(x²) + cos(2x) >1. Maybe this helps?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's check at x=1: 2 sin(1) + cos(2) ≈2*0.8415 + (-0.4161) ≈1.683 -0.4161≈1.2669>1. So holds. At x approaching sqrt(pi/2): 2 sin(pi/2) + cos(2*sqrt(pi/2)) = 2*1 + cos(√(2pi)). √(2pi) ≈2.506. cos(2.506)≈-0.809. So 2*1 + (-0.809)=1.191>1. So holds. At x=0.5: 2 sin(0.25) + cos(1)≈2*0.2474 +0.5403≈0.4948+0.5403≈1.035>1. So holds. Maybe this inequality 2 sin(x²) + cos(2x) >1 holds for x in (0, sqrt(pi/2)). If we can prove this, then the original inequality holds.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function k(x)=2 sin(x²) + cos(2x) -1. We need to show k(x) >0. Compute k(0)=0 +1 -1=0. Compute derivative k’(x)=4x cos(x²) - 2 sin(2x). If we can show k’(x) >0 for x in (0, sqrt(pi/2)), then since k(0)=0, k(x) increases and remains positive. But k’(x)=4x cos(x²) -2 sin(2x). Let's factor out 2: 2[2x cos(x²) - sin(2x)] =2 f’(x). Wait, this is exactly twice the derivative of the original function f. So, k’(x)=2 f’(x). But we were trying to analyze f’(x) earlier. If k’(x)=2 f’(x), and if k’(x) >0, then f’(x) >0, implying f(x) increasing. But as we saw earlier, f’(x) might become negative near the upper end. However, if k(x) remains positive even if its derivative becomes negative, as long as it doesn't drop below zero.\n\nBut this seems circular. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nPerhaps consider comparing the functions x² and 2x. Wait, no. Let me think differently. For 0 <x <sqrt(pi/2), x² <pi/2. Let's consider the function m(x)=x² - 2x. For x>2, m(x) is positive, but in our interval x<1.25, so m(x)=x² -2x is negative. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: use the inequality sin(x²) - sin²x >0. Let's consider using the Mean Value Theorem. For some c between x and x², sin(x²) - sin(x) = cos(c)(x² -x). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, write the difference as sin(x²) - sin²x = sin(x²) - sinx * sinx. But I don't see an immediate way to apply identities here.\n\nWait, another approach: consider the function f(x)=sin(x²) - sin²x. We need to show f(x)>0. We know f(0)=0. Let's compute the second derivative to analyze concavity. First derivative f’(x)=2x cos(x²) - sin(2x). Second derivative f''(x)=2 cos(x²) - 4x² sin(x²) - 2 cos(2x). This might not be helpful, but perhaps evaluating the second derivative at critical points.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the behavior of f’(x). We need to check if f’(x) is positive in the interval. At x=0, f’(0)=0 -0=0. Let's compute the limit as x approaches 0 from the right: f’(x)≈2x*1 - 2x ≈2x -2x=0. But using higher-order terms, perhaps. Using the earlier Taylor expansion:\n\nf’(x)=2x cos(x²) - sin(2x)≈2x(1 -x^4/2) - (2x - (8x^3)/6 + ...)=2x -x^5 -2x + (4x^3)/3 +...= (4x^3)/3 -x^5 +... So for small x, f’(x) is positive. Therefore, f(x) is increasing near zero.\n\nAt x=1, f’(1)=2*1*cos(1) - sin(2). cos(1)≈0.5403, sin(2)≈0.9093. So f’(1)≈2*0.5403 -0.9093≈1.0806 -0.9093≈0.1713>0.\n\nAt x=1.2, x²=1.44, cos(x²)=cos(1.44)≈0.1305. So 2x cos(x²)=2*1.2*0.1305≈0.3132. sin(2x)=sin(2.4)≈0.6755. So f’(1.2)=0.3132 -0.6755≈-0.3623<0. So f’(x) becomes negative at x=1.2. But our interval goes up to x≈1.253. So f’(x) is positive up to some point, then negative. Therefore, f(x) increases, reaches a maximum, then decreases. But we need to check if at the point where it starts decreasing, it's still above zero.\n\nSince f(0)=0 and f increases to a maximum and then decreases, but at the upper limit x=√(pi/2), f(x)=sin(pi/2) - sin²(sqrt(pi/2))=1 - sin²(1.253)≈1 -0.9511²≈1 -0.904≈0.096>0. So even though f(x) starts decreasing after x=1.2, it remains positive until x=1.253.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that f(x) remains positive throughout, we need to confirm that the minimal value of f(x) in the interval is non-negative. Since f(x) starts at 0, increases to a maximum, then decreases to approximately 0.096 at the end, it never dips below zero. Hence, the inequality holds.\n\nBut to formally prove this, perhaps we can show that the minimal value of f(x) is non-negative. To find the minimum, we can set f’(x)=0 and check the minimal points. However, solving f’(x)=0 analytically may be difficult. Alternatively, we can use the fact that f(x) is increasing up to some point and then decreasing, but the minimal value is at the endpoints. But since f(0)=0 and f(sqrt(pi/2))≈0.096>0, and f(x) reaches a maximum in between, the function never goes below zero in between.\n\nAnother formal approach: suppose there exists some x in (0, sqrt(pi/2)) where f(x)=0. Since f(0)=0 and f(x) increases then decreases, but f(sqrt(pi/2))>0, then if there is another root, there must be a local minimum below zero. But since f(x) is continuous and differentiable, by Rolle's theorem, between two roots there must be a critical point. But since we only have one root at x=0 and the function ends at a positive value, there are no other roots. Therefore, f(x) >0 for 0 <x <sqrt(pi/2).\n\nBut this is a bit hand-wavy. A more rigorous proof would involve showing that f(x) has no zeros in (0, sqrt(pi/2)). Since f(x) starts at zero, increases, then decreases but remains positive at the upper bound, and there's only one critical point (a maximum), then f(x) remains positive.\n\nAlternatively, use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Suppose there exists a point c in (0, sqrt(pi/2)) where f(c)=0. Since f is continuous, and f(0)=0, f increases to a maximum, then decreases to f(sqrt(pi/2))>0, there's no point where f(x)=0 except at x=0.\n\nBut I think the key idea is that even though the derivative becomes negative, the function f(x) doesn't decrease enough to reach zero before x reaches sqrt(pi/2). Since at x=sqrt(pi/2), f(x) is still positive, and there's only one critical point (a maximum), the function remains positive throughout.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds for all x in (0, sqrt(pi/2)).",
