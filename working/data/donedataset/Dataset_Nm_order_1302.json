    "Content": "From Wikipedia : \"Any Borel probability measure on any metric space is a regular measure.\" I've been thinking about how to prove this. And now I'm wondering whether being Borel isn't enough. Is $\\mu(X) = 1$ (or $\\mu(X) < \\infty$) necessary and does $X$ have to be a metric space? I assume the answer to this is yes but I don't see why. Maybe someone could give me a hint for a proof or a proof? Thanks for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $X$ be a metrizable space and let $\\mu$ be a finite Borel measure on $X$. Let $\\Sigma$ be the family of Borel sets $A$ such that\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\mu(A) &= \\sup{\\{\\mu(F)\\,:\\,F \\subset A \\text{ is closed}\\}} = \\inf{\\{\\mu(G)\\,:\\,G \\supset A \\text{ is open}\\}}.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nSince for each closed set $A$ in a metrizable space we have $A = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} G_n$ for some sequence of open sets $G_n$, we see that $\\Sigma$ contains the closed sets. Clearly $\\Sigma$ is closed under complementation and I leave it to you to verify that it is closed under taking countable unions. Therefore $\\Sigma$ is the family of Borel sets. The same line of reasoning goes through in any space in which closed sets are $G_\\delta$-sets, e.g. perfectly normal spaces , which are a bit more general than metric spaces. Further remarks: While the definition of regularity used here is probably the most common one nowadays, it is a bit dangerous to speak of regularity without further specifying what is intended. Many authors mean by inner regularity that $\\mu(A) = \\sup{\\{\\mu(K)\\,:\\,K \\subset A \\text{ is compact}\\}}$ (that's probably due to Bourbaki,  where only measures on locally compact spaces were considered).\nThis property is often called tightness in modern texts. One can show that in a separable, completely metrizable space, every finite Borel measure is automatically tight, see Kechris, Classical Descriptive Set Theory , Theorem 17.11, p.107 for a proof. Without these assumptions this may fail. Some assumptions are necessary, but finiteness of $\\mu$ is much too strong. One can show (with quite a bit more work) that in a metrizable space, every semi-finite Borel measure (every set of infinite measure contains a set of finite measure) is inner regular with respect to the closed sets. Again, this extends to perfectly normal spaces. As for outer regularity, this notion is not particularly useful beyond $\\sigma$-finite Borel measures. One result that is useful is that a locally finite Borel measure (every point has an open neighborhood of finite measure) on a separable metrizable space is automatically $\\sigma$-finite and regular.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking about the statement that any Borel probability measure on any metric space is regular. They're wondering if the conditions of being a probability measure (with μ(X) = 1) and the space being metric are necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A Borel measure is regular if, for every Borel set, the measure can be approximated from above by open sets and from below by compact sets. The Wikipedia statement says that if you have a Borel probability measure on a metric space, it must be regular. The user is questioning whether the finite measure (μ(X) = 1) and the metric space requirement are essential.\n\nSo, to structure this as per the format, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. μ is a Borel measure. (That's given in the original statement.)\n2. μ is a probability measure, meaning μ(X) = 1. (The user is asking if this is necessary.)\n3. X is a metric space. (Another condition they're questioning.)\n\nThe problem is to determine whether these conditions (finite measure and metric space) are necessary for the regularity of the Borel measure. The user wants a hint or proof regarding the necessity of these conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem is more about verifying the necessity of the conditions in the Wikipedia statement. So the problem as structured should be to check if being Borel alone isn't sufficient and whether μ(X) being finite (or specifically 1) and X being a metric space are required for regularity.\n\nSo the assumptions listed should be each of the conditions mentioned: Borel measure, probability measure (finite), metric space. The problem is to determine the necessity of these conditions for regularity. But how to phrase the problem concisely?\n\nThe user's question is whether the conditions in the Wikipedia statement (probability measure and metric space) are necessary. So the problem is: Is every Borel probability measure on a metric space necessarily regular, and are the conditions of μ being a probability measure and X being a metric space necessary?\n\nBut the user is specifically asking for whether the conditions (μ(X) = 1 and X metric) are necessary. So the problem would be: Determine whether the conditions that μ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1) and X is a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to prove or show that the conditions are necessary. But the user is asking if those conditions are necessary, so the problem would be to verify if those conditions are indeed required. Alternatively, the problem might be phrased as: Is the regularity of a Borel measure μ on X guaranteed only when μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space?\n\nHmm. Let me recheck the original question. The user says: \"I've been thinking about how to prove this. And now I'm wondering whether being Borel isn't enough. Is μ(X) = 1 (or μ(X) < ∞) necessary and does X have to be a metric space? I assume the answer to this is yes but I don't see why. Maybe someone could give me a hint for a proof or a proof?\"\n\nSo the problem they want to structure is to check the necessity of μ(X) being finite (or probability) and X being metric for the regularity of μ. So the problem is: Are the conditions μ(X) < ∞ and X being a metric space necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions in the problem would be:\n\n- μ is a Borel measure.\n- μ(X) < ∞ (or μ is a probability measure, μ(X)=1).\n- X is a metric space.\n\nBut the user is asking if these are necessary. So the problem is to determine whether these conditions are necessary. However, the way the example was structured was to list the assumptions given in the problem and then the problem to prove. But here, the original problem is more about verifying the necessity of certain conditions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, but the user had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, in the example, the user's original problem had the assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The example's formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, but maybe the example was from a different problem?\n\nWait, maybe the example given was a different case. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists the assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". But 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the given format.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is whether the conditions (μ being a probability measure and X being a metric space) are necessary for the regularity of the Borel measure. So the problem is to determine the necessity of these conditions.\n\nBut the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". The original problem on Math Exchange is: From Wikipedia: \"Any Borel probability measure on any metric space is a regular measure.\" The user is asking if being Borel isn't enough, and if μ(X)=1 or finite, and X being metric are necessary.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be the conditions given in the Wikipedia statement: μ is a Borel measure, μ is a probability measure (μ(X)=1), and X is a metric space. The problem is to determine whether these conditions are necessary for μ to be regular.\n\nBut how to phrase this in the problem section? The user is asking if these conditions are necessary. So maybe the problem is: Determine whether a Borel measure μ on a space X is regular only if μ is a probability measure (μ(X)=1) and X is a metric space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is: Are the conditions that μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular?\n\nBut the example given has the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is to verify the necessity of the conditions in the Wikipedia statement. But how to phrase that as a problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is: Is every Borel measure μ on a metric space X with μ(X)=1 regular? Are the conditions μ(X)=1 and X being a metric space necessary?\n\nWait, but the user is asking for whether those conditions are necessary. So maybe the problem is: Show that the conditions μ(X)=1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure to be regular.\n\nBut the user might be seeking either a proof that those conditions are required (i.e., without them, regularity fails) or a confirmation. So structuring the problem as: \"Determine whether the conditions that μ is a probability measure (μ(X)=1) and X is a metric space are necessary for the regularity of μ.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to prove that the conditions are necessary. But since the user is asking whether they are necessary, maybe the problem is: Are the conditions μ(X)=1 and X being a metric space necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular?\n\nHowever, the example's problem was a statement to prove. Here, the user's problem is more of a question about necessity, which could be phrased as a problem to \"Determine if...\" or \"Show that...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem should be phrased as: Prove that a Borel measure μ on X is regular if and only if μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space. But I think that's not accurate because the Wikipedia statement is one direction (if), and the user is asking about necessity (only if).\n\nAlternatively, the problem is: Is the regularity of a Borel measure μ on X guaranteed only when μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space?\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is more about the user wanting to know why the conditions are necessary. So maybe the problem is: Show that the conditions μ(X)=1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut the user is probably looking for an explanation or proof that these conditions are required. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions from the Wikipedia statement, and the problem is to determine their necessity. However, the example seems to take the original problem's conditions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed the assumptions as n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, the example might be incorrect, but regardless, we need to follow the instruction.\n\nGiven the user's question, the assumptions would be each condition mentioned in the Wikipedia statement. But the user is asking if those conditions are necessary. So perhaps the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the conditions that might be necessary and the problem is to check their necessity.\n\nAlternatively, the original problem is to prove the statement from Wikipedia, but the user is questioning the necessity of the conditions. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the statement (Borel probability measure on a metric space), and the problem is to prove that under these conditions, the measure is regular. But the user is asking if those conditions are necessary, so maybe the problem is to show that each condition is necessary.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to know if the conditions can be relaxed. For example, can we have a Borel measure that's not probability (i.e., infinite measure) on a metric space and still have regularity? Or can we have a Borel probability measure on a non-metric space that's not regular?\n\nTherefore, the problem would be to show that the conditions (μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space) are necessary for the regularity of μ.\n\nBut how to phrase this in the problem section. Maybe: Determine whether the conditions that μ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1) and X is a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a statement to prove. Here, the problem is more of a question. But according to the format, the problem should be a statement. So perhaps the problem is: Show that a Borel measure μ is regular only if μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space.\n\nBut this might not be true because there are regular Borel measures that are not probability measures. For example, Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space is regular and σ-finite, not finite. However, the Wikipedia statement says that any Borel probability measure on a metric space is regular, but it doesn't say that only such measures are regular.\n\nTherefore, the user's confusion is whether the conditions are necessary. The answer would be that the metric space is necessary because there are counterexamples in non-metrizable spaces, and the finite measure (or probability) is also necessary because in infinite measures, regularity might fail.\n\nBut how to structure this. The original problem is the user asking whether the conditions in the Wikipedia statement are necessary. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- μ is a Borel measure.\n- μ is a probability measure (μ(X)=1).\n- X is a metric space.\n\nBut the user is questioning if these are necessary. So the problem is to determine if these conditions are required for μ to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. So the Wikipedia statement says that if you have a Borel probability measure on a metric space, then it's regular. The user is asking: is being Borel not enough? Do we need μ(X)=1 and X to be metric? So the problem they want to structure is to verify the necessity of these conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the Wikipedia statement, and the problem is to determine their necessity.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is: Prove that a Borel measure μ on X is regular only if μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space. But this isn't accurate because there are regular Borel measures that aren't probability measures (e.g., Lebesgue measure on ℝ^n is regular and σ-finite). Therefore, the user's question is slightly off. The Wikipedia statement gives a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. So the user is misunderstanding, thinking that the conditions are necessary, but they're actually sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the problem might be to show that the conditions are sufficient but not necessary. But the user is asking whether the conditions are necessary. So the answer would involve showing that there exist Borel measures that are regular without satisfying those conditions (hence the conditions are not necessary), but the user thought they were necessary.\n\nBut given the original problem, how to structure it as per the format. The user's question is: Is μ(X)=1 (or finite) and X metric necessary for a Borel measure to be regular? The answer is no, but there are cases where without these conditions, regularity may fail. The user wants a proof or explanation.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions from the Wikipedia theorem (Borel, probability, metric) and the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, μ is regular. But the user is asking about necessity, so maybe the problem is to show that these conditions are necessary, but actually, they are not. So perhaps the problem is: Are the conditions that μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space necessary for a Borel measure to be regular?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a statement to prove, not a question. So maybe the user wants to structure the problem as: Prove that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure to be regular. But this would be incorrect because they are not strictly necessary. Hence, the problem might need to be rephrased.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is confused and thinks the conditions are necessary, perhaps the problem is to determine whether the conditions are necessary by providing counterexamples where omitting one condition leads to a non-regular Borel measure.\n\nIn summary, after this lengthy thinking, the assumptions are:\n\n- μ is a Borel measure.\n- μ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1).\n- X is a metric space.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether these conditions are necessary for μ to be regular. But since the format requires the problem to be a statement, perhaps: Show that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular. But actually, the answer is that they are not strictly necessary, but they are sufficient. Therefore, the user's question is based on a misunderstanding.\n\nBut given the user's original question, they believe the answer is yes, but they want to see why. So perhaps the problem is to prove that a Borel measure on a metric space with μ(X) = 1 is regular, and show that these conditions cannot be omitted.\n\nBut the user's problem is: \"Is μ(X) = 1 (or μ(X) < ∞) necessary and does X have to be a metric space?\" So the formatted problem should be structured with assumptions being the conditions in question, and the problem is to verify their necessity.\n\nBut the example format seems to take the original problem's conditions as assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not just those divisible by 7. So maybe the example is flawed, but we need to proceed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as per the user's question. The user is asking about the necessity of μ(X) =1 (or finite) and X being metric. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- μ is a Borel measure.\n- μ(X) < ∞ (or μ(X) = 1).\n- X is a metric space.\n\nProblem: Determine whether the conditions μ(X) < ∞ and X being a metric space are necessary for μ to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem was to prove something given the assumptions. Here, the problem is more of a question. But the example's problem is a statement to prove. Therefore, perhaps we need to frame it as: Prove that a Borel measure μ on X is regular if and only if μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space. But this is not correct because the \"if and only if\" is not true. The Wikipedia statement is an \"if\", not an \"only if\".\n\nTherefore, given the user's confusion, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure,\nμ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1),\nX is a metric space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that μ is regular, and determine whether the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary.\n\nBut perhaps that's combining two things. Alternatively, given the user is asking whether the conditions are necessary, the problem would be: Determine whether the conditions that μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is a statement to prove. Therefore, perhaps the problem is: Show that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut in reality, these conditions are sufficient but not necessary. So the answer would involve showing that there exist regular Borel measures without these conditions, but the user might be looking for cases where without these conditions, regularity fails.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is: Provide examples showing that the conditions μ(X) < ∞ and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut given the user's original question, they want to know why the conditions are necessary. So the problem would be to show that there exist Borel measures which are not regular when these conditions are not met.\n\nIn conclusion, after all this, the formatted problem should list the assumptions from the Wikipedia statement (Borel, probability, metric space) and the problem is to prove regularity under these conditions and discuss the necessity of the conditions. But according to the user's specific question, they are asking whether these conditions are necessary, so the problem is to determine their necessity. However, the example provided structures the problem as a statement to prove. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be phrased as: Prove that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure to be regular.\n\nBut since that's not accurate (they are sufficient but not necessary), perhaps the answer should structure the problem as per the user's misunderstanding, and then the answer would correct it. But according to the task, the assistant must format the problem as per the given example, without providing the answer.\n\nTherefore, given the user's original question, the formatted problem should have assumptions as per the Wikipedia statement (Borel, probability, metric), and the problem is to prove regularity. However, the user is asking about the necessity, so maybe the problem is to show that the conditions are necessary.\n\nBut I think there's confusion here. The user is referring to the Wikipedia statement that any Borel probability measure on any metric space is regular. They are asking: Is being Borel not enough? Are the other conditions necessary? So the formatted problem's assumptions would include all conditions in the theorem, and the problem is to prove the theorem. But the user's actual question is about the necessity of those conditions, which is a different problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether μ being a probability measure (μ(X) = 1) and X being a metric space are necessary conditions for μ to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is a statement to prove, not a question. Therefore, maybe the problem is: Show that μ being a probability measure and X being a metric space are necessary conditions for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut since that's not true, the problem as phrased would be incorrect. However, given the user's perspective, they believe these conditions are necessary, so perhaps the problem is to show their necessity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is: Prove that if μ is a regular Borel measure, then μ must be a probability measure and X must be a metric space. But this is false, so the problem would be ill-posed.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to structure the problem as per the original theorem from Wikipedia, which is to prove that a Borel probability measure on a metric space is regular, and then the user is asking about the necessity. But the format requires the problem to be structured with assumptions and the problem. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions from the theorem, and the problem is to prove the regularity. The user's actual question is about the necessity of these assumptions, which is a separate question. But since the task is to format the user's question into assumptions and problem, I think the best approach is:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure,\nμ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1),\nX is a metric space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that μ is regular, and determine whether the assumptions are necessary.\n\nBut the example didn't have multiple parts. The example had the problem as a single statement to prove. Therefore, given the user's question, which is about the necessity of the conditions, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether μ must be a probability measure (μ(X) = 1) and X must be a metric space for μ to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is a statement, not a question. However, the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", so perhaps the problem here should be: Show that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all angles, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as the conditions the user is questioning (Borel measure, probability measure, metric space), and the problem is to determine their necessity. However, since the example structures the problem as a statement to prove, perhaps the problem is: Prove that the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut in reality, this isn't true. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. Given the user's original question, they are asking if those conditions are necessary. The formatted problem should reflect that inquiry. Since the example uses a statement to prove, perhaps the problem is structured as a statement: Determine whether the conditions μ(X) = 1 and X being a metric space are necessary for a Borel measure μ to be regular.\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that...\", so maybe the assistant should rephrase the user's question into a statement to prove. However, the user's question is a meta-question about the necessity of conditions. Therefore, perhaps the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether the conditions that μ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1) and X is a metric space are necessary for μ to be regular.\n\nBut according to the example's problem format, which was a statement to prove, perhaps the problem here should be: Prove that a Borel measure μ is regular only if μ is a probability measure and X is a metric space.\n\nBut this is incorrect, as regularity can hold without these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer would need to address this, but the formatting task is just to structure the problem, not to answer it.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the user's original problem was to prove something, and the formatted problem was to prove it under certain assumptions (even if they were mistakenly added, like n divisible by 7), I think the correct approach here is to list the assumptions from the theorem (Borel, probability, metric space) and the problem is to prove regularity, which matches the example's structure. The user's actual question about necessity would be a separate problem, but the format requires capturing the main problem as stated.\n\nWait, the original question starts with the user wanting to prove the Wikipedia statement and then questioning the necessity of the conditions. So the main problem is the Wikipedia statement: \"Any Borel probability measure on any metric space is a regular measure.\" The user is asking for a proof and also questioning the necessity. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which for the example took the original problem and formatted it with assumptions and the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem here should have:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure,\nμ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1),\nX is a metric space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that μ is regular.\n\nBut the user is also asking about the necessity of these conditions. However, the example only included the main problem to prove. Therefore, the formatted problem would be to prove the regularity under the given assumptions, and the user's additional questions about necessity are separate. But since the user's question includes both the request for a proof and the necessity, perhaps the formatted problem should include both. However, the example didn't include multiple parts. Therefore, perhaps the main problem is to prove the regularity under the assumptions, and the necessity is a secondary question not captured in the format.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to prove the statement and discuss the necessity, but the format requires only the main problem. Given this, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nμ is a Borel measure,\nμ is a probability measure (μ(X) = 1),\nX is a metric space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that μ is regular.\n\nBut the user's actual question is about the necessity of these assumptions. However, the example structured the problem as the original proof question, adding assumptions. Therefore, following the example, the formatted problem is to prove the regularity under the given assumptions, and the user's question about necessity is beyond the format. Therefore, the correct formatted problem is as above.",
