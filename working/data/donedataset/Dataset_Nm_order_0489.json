    "Content": "I tried to show that the continuous functions on $[0,1]$ are dense in $L^p[0,1]$ for $ 1 \\leq p< \\infty $ by using Lusin's theorem. I proceeded as follows. By using Lusin's theorem, for any $f \\in L^p[0,1]$ , for any given $ \\epsilon $ $ > $ 0, there exists a closed set $ F_\\epsilon $ such that $ m([0,1]- F_\\epsilon) < \\epsilon$ and $f$ restricted to $F_\\epsilon$ is continuous. Using Tietze's extension theorem, extend $f$ to a continuous function $g$ on $[0,1]$ .\nWe claim that $\\Vert f-g\\Vert_p $ is sufficiently small. \\begin{align}\n\\Vert f-g\\Vert_p ^p &= \\displaystyle \\int_{[0,1]-F_\\epsilon} |f(x)-g(x)|^p dx \n\\\\\n&\\leq \\displaystyle \\int_{[0,1]-F_\\epsilon} 2^p (|f(x)|^p + |g(x)|^p) dx \n\\end{align} now using properties of $L^p$ functions, we can make first part of our integral sufficiently small. Furthermore, since $g$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ , $g$ has an upper bound $M$ , so that second part of integration also become sufficiently small. I thought I solved problem, but there was a serious problem.. our choice of $g$ is dependent of $\\epsilon$ , so constant $M$ is actually dependent of $\\epsilon$ , so it is not guaranteed that second part of integration becomes 0 as $\\epsilon $ tends to 0. I think if our choice of extension can be chosen further specifically, for example, by imposing $g \\leq f$ such kind of argument would work. Can anyone help to complete my proof here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f\\in\\mathbb L^p$ and $\\varepsilon\\gt 0$ . Choose $N$ such that $\\left\\lVert f-f\\mathbf 1_{-N\\leqslant f\\leqslant N}\\right\\rVert_p\\leqslant \\varepsilon/2$ . Let $f_N:=f\\mathbf 1_{-N\\leqslant f\\leqslant N}$ . Lusin's theorem gives a closed set $F$ such that $[0,1]\\setminus F$ has measure smaller than $2^{-p}  \\varepsilon^p/\\left(2N\\right)^p$ , and $f_N$ restricted to $F$ is continuous. Tietze extension theorem applied to $f_N$ and $F$ gives that the extension $g$ is still  bounded by $N$ . Consequently, $$\\left\\lVert f_N-g\\right\\rVert_p^p=\\int_{[0,1]\\setminus F}  \\left\\lvert f_N-g\\right\\rvert_p^p\\leqslant (2N)^p\\lambda\\left([0,1]\\setminus F\\right)\\leqslant 2^{-p}\\varepsilon^p. $$ We thus got a continuous function $g$ such that $$\\left\\lVert f-g\\right\\rVert_p\\leqslant \\varepsilon,$$ which show that the set of continuous functions is dense in $\\mathbb L^p$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Continuous functions on [0,1] is dense in L^p[0,1] for 1 ≤ p < ∞\". The question starts by explaining that the user tried to prove the density using Lusin's theorem and Tietze extension. They mention constructing a continuous function g from f ∈ L^p by restricting f to a closed set F_ε with small measure complement, then extending via Tietze. The problem arises because the bound M on g depends on ε, making it unclear if the integral of |g|^p over the small set vanishes as ε→0.\n\nThe user is asking for help to complete the proof by possibly modifying the extension g, maybe imposing g ≤ f or another condition.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given in the prompt shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. The problem is then stated.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to show that continuous functions on [0,1] are dense in L^p[0,1] for 1 ≤ p < ∞. The user attempted using Lusin and Tietze, but ran into an issue with the dependence of M on ε. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- The space considered is L^p[0,1] with 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Lusin's theorem is applied to f ∈ L^p[0,1], giving a closed set F_ε where f is continuous, with measure of complement < ε.\n- Tietze's extension theorem is used to extend f|F_ε to a continuous function g on [0,1].\n- The user's approach involves estimating ||f - g||_p, splitting the integral into [0,1] - F_ε part.\n- The issue is the dependence of the bound M (on g) on ε, which complicates making the integral small.\n\nBut the problem statement itself, as per the user's original goal, is to prove the density of continuous functions in L^p. The user's attempt is part of the context, but the core problem remains as stated in the title. However, the example in the prompt seems to take into account any specific conditions mentioned in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's context.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the user made a mistake there. Maybe the example is incorrect. But in any case, the instruction is to structure the current problem's assumptions and problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the main assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is L^p[0,1] where 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Lusin's theorem is applicable to functions in L^p[0,1].\n- Tietze's extension theorem is used to extend the restricted function to a continuous function on [0,1].\n- The norm ||f - g||_p is split into the integral over [0,1] - F_ε.\n- The bound on g depends on ε, causing an issue in the estimate.\n\nBut the assumptions in the problem are not about the user's approach, but the problem's inherent conditions. Wait, maybe I need to parse the problem as per the user's specific setup. The problem is to show continuous functions are dense in L^p, and the user's approach uses Lusin and Tietze. The problem the user is facing is in the step where they need to show ||f - g||_p can be made small, but the extension g's bound M depends on ε. Therefore, the problem as posed by the user is to complete this proof approach, addressing the dependency issue.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem's \"Assumption\" section includes the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is flawed. However, following the user's instruction, perhaps the assumptions should include all the conditions the user is using in their approach, not just the problem's original statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should be the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem's original assumption is that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted problem's assumption lists that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. That suggests maybe the example has an error, but I need to follow the format as per the user's example.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the user (the one who created the example) made a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. This seems incorrect unless the original problem had that condition, but it's stated as \"for every integer n\". Maybe the example is wrong. But in any case, the task is to structure the given problem according to the format, following the example's structure, even if the example is flawed.\n\nSo for the current problem, the problem statement from the user is to complete their proof attempt. The original problem is to show continuous functions are dense in L^p, and the user is stuck on a specific part of their approach. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions they have set up in their approach:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Let 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Let f ∈ L^p[0,1].\n- For any ε > 0, there exists a closed set F_ε ⊂ [0,1] such that m([0,1] \\ F_ε) < ε and f restricted to F_ε is continuous.\n- By Tietze's theorem, f|F_ε extends to a continuous function g on [0,1].\n- The norm ||f - g||_p^p is estimated by integrating over [0,1] \\ F_ε.\n- The extension g satisfies |g(x)| ≤ M for some M dependent on ε.\n\nProblem: Show that ||f - g||_p can be made arbitrarily small despite M depending on ε.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to complete the proof using Lusin and Tietze, handling the dependency of M on ε.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property of one object. The problem is then the core question.\n\nIn the original problem's title, the core problem is \"Continuous functions on [0,1] are dense in L^p[0,1] for 1 ≤ p < ∞\". The user's specific problem is in completing their proof approach using Lusin and Tietze, where the bound M on g depends on ε, so they can't guarantee the integral of |g|^p goes to zero.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the user is working:\n\n- The space is L^p[0,1] with 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- f ∈ L^p[0,1].\n- For any ε > 0, there exists a closed set F_ε with m([0,1] \\ F_ε) < ε such that f|F_ε is continuous.\n- g is a Tietze extension of f|F_ε to [0,1], hence continuous.\n- The integral ||f - g||_p^p is split into [0,1] \\ F_ε part.\n- The bound M on |g| depends on ε.\n\nProblem: How to modify the approach or choose g such that ||f - g||_p can be made arbitrarily small despite M depending on ε?\n\nAlternatively, the problem as per the user's question is to complete their proof by addressing the dependency issue.\n\nBut following the example, the problem statement in the formatted version was slightly modified from the original. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe in the example, the user intended to include the step where n must satisfy a divisibility condition, but the original problem didn't state that. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions inherent to the problem, not the proof attempt. For the original problem \"Continuous functions on [0,1] are dense in L^p[0,1] for 1 ≤ p < ∞\", the assumptions would be:\n\n- The space is L^p[0,1].\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Continuous functions on [0,1] are considered with the L^p norm.\n\nProblem: Prove that continuous functions are dense in L^p[0,1].\n\nBut the user's specific problem is about their proof attempt using Lusin and Tietze, and the issue with M depending on ε. So the problem, as per the user's question, is to complete their specific proof approach.\n\nTherefore, to structure it according to the example, the assumptions would be the conditions they are using in their approach:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- f ∈ L^p[0,1].\n- For any ε > 0, there exists a closed set F_ε ⊆ [0,1] such that m([0,1] \\ F_ε) < ε and f|F_ε is continuous.\n- g is a continuous extension of f|F_ε to [0,1] via Tietze's theorem.\n- The L^p norm ||f - g||_p^p is bounded by the integral over [0,1] \\ F_ε of 2^p(|f|^p + |g|^p).\n- The bound M on |g| depends on ε.\n\nProblem: Show that ||f - g||_p can be made arbitrarily small despite the dependency of M on ε.\n\nBut the user is asking for help to complete their proof, possibly by modifying the extension g to have a bound independent of ε or another method.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions applied to the object (n is an integer, n divisible by 7), even though the original problem was for every integer n. This suggests that perhaps in the current case, the assumptions should include the specific conditions used in the proof attempt, not just the problem's general assumptions.\n\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. To adhere to the example's format, perhaps the assumptions should include:\n\n- The user is working within L^p[0,1] for 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Using Lusin's theorem to get a closed set where f is continuous.\n- Extending via Tietze to a continuous function g.\n- The estimate splitting the norm into the complement of F_ε.\n- The bound M on g depends on ε.\n\nBut the problem is to complete the proof under these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated in the title, and the assumptions are the general conditions. The example might have been incorrect, but following the user's instruction to mimic the example, even if flawed.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the assumptions include any conditions needed for the proof, even if they're not in the original problem. However, that seems incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example was a mistake, and the actual task is to list the problem's given assumptions, not the proof's steps.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example's structure where the original problem's conditions are listed as assumptions (even if in the example it added an extra condition), for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The space is L^p[0,1] where 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n- Continuous functions on [0,1] are considered as a subset of L^p[0,1].\n- Lusin's theorem and Tietze's extension theorem are applicable.\n\nProblem: Prove that continuous functions on [0,1] are dense in L^p[0,1] by showing that for any f ∈ L^p[0,1] and ε > 0, there exists a continuous function g such that ||f - g||_p < ε, addressing the dependency of the extension's bound on ε.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about their approach using Lusin and Tietze leading to g with M dependent on ε. So the problem as per their question is to resolve that issue in their proof.\n\nTherefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 \\leq p < \\infty$,\n$f \\in L^p[0,1]$,\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a closed set $F_\\epsilon \\subseteq [0,1]$ with $m([0,1] \\setminus F_\\epsilon) < \\epsilon$ such that $f|_{F_\\epsilon}$ is continuous,\n$g$ is a continuous extension of $f|_{F_\\epsilon}$ to $[0,1]$ via Tietze's theorem,\nThe $L^p$ norm $\\|f - g\\|_p^p$ is estimated by $\\int_{[0,1] \\setminus F_\\epsilon} 2^p(|f(x)|^p + |g(x)|^p) dx$,\nThe bound $M$ on $|g|$ depends on $\\epsilon$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\|f - g\\|_p$ can be made arbitrarily small despite the dependency of $M$ on $\\epsilon$.\n\nBut this might be too detailed. The example had concise assumptions. Maybe better to capture the main conditions without proof steps.\n\nAlternatively, considering the problem as presented in the title and the user's specific difficulty:\n\nAssumption:\nThe space is $L^p[0,1]$ for $1 \\leq p < \\infty$,\nContinuous functions on $[0,1]$ are to be shown dense in $L^p[0,1]$,\nLusin's theorem and Tietze's extension theorem are used in the proof attempt.\n\nProblem:\nComplete the proof that continuous functions are dense in $L^p[0,1]$ by addressing the issue that the extension $g$'s bound $M$ depends on $\\epsilon$, preventing the integral $\\int_{[0,1] \\setminus F_\\epsilon} |g(x)|^p dx$ from being suitably small.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to list the mathematical assumptions inherent to the problem, not the proof steps. The problem's core assumption is working in L^p[0,1], 1 ≤ p < ∞, and the goal is to prove density. The user's specific problem is a step in their proof using Lusin and Tietze, encountering an issue with the extension's bound.\n\nHowever, the example given by the user included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions (n is an integer) and possibly an extra one (n divisible by 7). Given that confusion, but to follow the example's structure, perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 \\leq p < \\infty$,\n$f \\in L^p[0,1]$,\n$F_\\epsilon$ is a closed subset of $[0,1]$ with $m([0,1] \\setminus F_\\epsilon) < \\epsilon$,\n$f$ restricted to $F_\\epsilon$ is continuous,\n$g$ is a continuous extension of $f|_{F_\\epsilon}$ to $[0,1]$,\nThe norm $\\|f - g\\|_p$ is to be estimated.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $\\|f - g\\|_p$ can be made arbitrarily small despite the extension $g$ depending on $\\epsilon$ and potentially having a bound $M$ that increases as $\\epsilon$ decreases.\n\nAlternatively, to make it concise like the example:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 \\leq p < \\infty$,\n$f \\in L^p[0,1]$,\nFor every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a closed set $F_\\epsilon \\subseteq [0,1]$ with $m([0,1] \\setminus F_\\epsilon) < \\epsilon$ and $f|_{F_\\epsilon}$ is continuous,\n$g$ is a continuous extension of $f|_{F_\\epsilon}$ to $[0,1]$ via Tietze's theorem,\nThe bound $M$ on $g$ depends on $\\epsilon$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\|f - g\\|_p$ can be made arbitrarily small to show continuous functions are dense in $L^p[0,1]$.\n\nThis seems to align with the example's format, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of an object. Then the problem is stated.",
