    "Content": "Let $f,g:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be two functions of class $C^1$ such that $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ for all $x\\in [0,1]$ . Assume that $$\nf(0) = g(0) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad f(1) = g(1).\n$$ Show that there exist $x,y\\in[0,1]$ such that $$\nf(x) = g(y) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad f'(x) = g'(y).\n$$ I made the following attempts (non of them worked): First, define a function $h:[0,1]\\times [0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ given by $$\nh(x,y) = [f(x)-g(y)]^2 + [f'(x)-g'(y)]^2\n$$ and try to show that $h(x,y) = 0$ for some $(x,y)$ . Then I defined $k:[0,1]\\times [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by $$\nk(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}[f(x)-f(y)]^2\n$$ and tried to show that at some point $(x,y)$ the divergence of $k$ is zero, because in this case we have that $$\n0 = \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial x}(x,y) + \\frac{\\partial k}{\\partial y}(x,y) = (f(x)-g(y))f'(x)-(f(x)-f(y))g'(y) = (f(x)-f(y))(f'(x)-g'(y))\n$$ but it didn't work either. May be I'm not following the right way to solve this exercise.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Set $a = f(0) = g(0)$ and $b = f(1) = g(1)$ . $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing from $[0, 1]$ to $[a, b]$ and therefore invertible. If we define the function $$\n h: [a, b]\\to \\Bbb R, \\, h(t) = f^{-1}(t) - g^{-1}(t)\n$$ then $h(a) = h(b) = 0$ and Rolle's theorem shows that for some $c \\in (a, b)$ $$\n 0 = h'(c) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(c))} - \\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(c))} \\\\\n\\implies f'(f^{-1}(c)) = g'(g^{-1}(c)) \\, .\n$$ We can now set $$\n  x = f^{-1}(c) \\, , \\, y = g^{-1}(c) \\, .\n$$ $x$ and $y$ are both in the open interval $(0, 1)$ and have the desired properties $$\n f(x) = g(y) \\, , \\, f'(x) = g'(y) \\, .\n$$ Illustration: The graphs of $f$ and $g$ are green. $c$ is the argument on the $y$ -axis where the inverse functions have the same slope. $x$ and $y$ are the pre-images of $c$ under $f$ and $g$ . (Created with GeoGebra.) Remarks: If $f$ and $g$ are not identical functions then $h$ is not identically zero and we can choose $c\\in (a, b)$ as a point where $h$ attains its nonzero minimum or maximum, so that $x - y = h(c) \\ne 0$ . This shows that (unless $f=g$ ) a pair $x, y$ of distinct points in $(0, 1)$ with those properties exists. It suffices to require that the functions are continuous on $[0, 1]$ , and differentiable on $(0, 1)$ with positive derivative. The continuity of the derivative, or differentiability at the endpoints is not needed. (This was noticed by Ari Brodsky in a comment.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nThe original question is about two functions f and g defined on [0,1]. They are both C^1 functions, meaning they have continuous first derivatives. The assumptions given are that their derivatives are positive everywhere on the interval, they share the same values at the endpoints (f(0)=g(0) and f(1)=g(1)), and the problem is to show that there exist points x and y in [0,1] where both f(x)=g(y) and their derivatives f'(x)=g'(y) hold.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f and g are functions from [0,1] to R. (Domain and codomain)\n2. f and g are of class C^1. (Differentiability)\n3. f'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1]. (Strictly increasing for f)\n4. g'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1]. (Strictly increasing for g)\n5. f(0) = g(0). (Same starting value)\n6. f(1) = g(1). (Same ending value)\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to show the existence of points x and y where both the function values and their derivatives coincide.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition. For example, the C^1 class is one assumption for both functions, but since they are both C^1, maybe split into two? Wait, the problem states \"two functions of class C^1\", so maybe that's a joint assumption. Wait, the user's example split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines, even though both apply to the same object. So perhaps for each property, even if applied to the same object, they should be separate.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms. The formatted assumption listed two separate lines: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So even though both are about n, they are separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f and g are functions from [0,1] to R.\n- f is of class C^1 on [0,1].\n- g is of class C^1 on [0,1].\n- f'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1].\n- g'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1].\n- f(0) = g(0).\n- f(1) = g(1).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"two functions of class C^1 such that f'(x) >0 and g'(x) >0 for all x\". So maybe the C^1 condition is one assumption for both functions. But according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So if the problem states \"f and g are of class C^1\", that would be two separate assumptions: one for f being C^1 and another for g being C^1. Similarly, their derivatives being positive would be two separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"f and g are of class C^1\" is a single assumption. But the example shows that when multiple properties apply to the same object, they are split. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are split. So perhaps even if two properties apply to different objects, each gets its own line. So for f and g being C^1, that's two separate assumptions. But the original problem says \"two functions of class C^1\", so maybe that's a joint assumption. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\" So each line should have one property for one object. So for f and g being C^1, that's two separate assumptions: one for f, one for g. Similarly, their derivatives being positive would be two separate assumptions. The initial equalities f(0)=g(0) and f(1)=g(1) are two separate assumptions as well. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"Let $f,g:[0,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be two functions of class $C^1$ such that $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ for all $x\\in [0,1]$ . Assume that $$\nf(0) = g(0) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad f(1) = g(1).\n$$ Show that there exist $x,y\\in[0,1]$ such that $$\nf(x) = g(y) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad f'(x) = g'(y).\n$$\"\n\nSo \"two functions of class C^1\" applies to both f and g. So perhaps \"f is of class C^1\" and \"g is of class C^1\" as separate assumptions. Then \"f'(x) >0 for all x\" and \"g'(x) >0 for all x\" as separate. Then the two equalities f(0)=g(0) and f(1)=g(1). So total of 6 assumptions:\n\n1. f: [0,1] → ℝ\n2. g: [0,1] → ℝ\n3. f is of class C^1 on [0,1]\n4. g is of class C^1 on [0,1]\n5. f'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1]\n6. g'(x) > 0 for all x in [0,1]\n7. f(0) = g(0)\n8. f(1) = g(1)\n\nWait, but the original problem statement lists f and g as functions from [0,1] to R. So that's two assumptions: domain and codomain for f, and same for g. But the user's example didn't split that. In the example, the assumption was simply \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So maybe for functions, the domain and codomain can be considered as one assumption per function. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is a function from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- g is a function from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- f is of class C^1 on [0,1].\n- g is of class C^1 on [0,1].\n- f is strictly increasing on [0,1] (since f’(x) >0 for all x).\n- g is strictly increasing on [0,1].\n- f(0) = g(0).\n- f(1) = g(1).\n\nBut the original problem states f’(x) >0 and g’(x) >0, which implies strictly increasing, but the user may prefer the exact condition given. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f is a function from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- g is a function from [0,1] to ℝ.\n- f is continuously differentiable on [0,1].\n- g is continuously differentiable on [0,1].\n- The derivative of f is positive for all x in [0,1].\n- The derivative of g is positive for all x in [0,1].\n- f(0) equals g(0).\n- f(1) equals g(1).\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object. So that's 8 assumptions.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example's original problem was about n being an integer, then n divisible by 7. So two separate lines. Similarly, for functions, each property per line. So the answer should list each assumption one by one, each as a single line, each applying to one object and one property.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nf is a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\ng is a function from [0,1] to ℝ,\nf is of class C^1 on [0,1],\ng is of class C^1 on [0,1],\nThe derivative of f is positive for all x in [0,1],\nThe derivative of g is positive for all x in [0,1],\nf(0) equals g(0),\nf(1) equals g(1).\nProblem:\nShow that there exist x,y in [0,1] such that f(x) = g(y) and f'(x) = g'(y).\n\nBut need to check if \"f is of class C^1 on [0,1]\" is one assumption. Since the user's example had separate properties for the same object, in the example, n was an integer and n divisible by 7. So here, the domain/codomain is one assumption for each function, being C^1 is another, derivative positive is another. So yes, each on its own line.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list all these assumptions line by line.",
