    "AcceptedAnswer": "For $n\\in\\Bbb Z^+$ let $D_n$ be a countable dense subset of $X_n$ , and fix a point $x_n\\in D_n$ . For $m\\in\\Bbb Z^+$ let $$E_m=\\left\\{y\\in\\prod_{n\\in\\Bbb Z^+}D_n:y_n=x_n\\text{ for all }n\\ge m\\right\\}\\;,$$ and let $$E=\\bigcup_{m\\in\\Bbb Z^+}E_m\\;.$$ Then each $$E_m=\\prod_{1\\le n<m}D_n\\times\\prod_{n\\ge m}\\{x_n\\}$$ is clearly countable, so $E$ is countable.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question states that we have a sequence of separable spaces {X_j} from j=1 to infinity, and the goal is to prove that their infinite Cartesian product is separable by showing it has a countable dense subset, leveraging the fact that each X_m has a countable dense subset.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: Each X_j in the sequence is a separable space. That's the main given. Separable means each X_j has a countable dense subset. The problem is about the product of these spaces. The user example in the prompt had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Each X_j is a separable space.\n2. For each X_j, there exists a countable dense subset (since separability implies that).\n3. The problem involves the infinite Cartesian product of these spaces.\n\nWait, but the problem statement mentions \"the infinite cartesian product of separable spaces\" and the goal is to prove it's separable. The user example structured assumptions as one per line, each about one object. So for this problem, the main assumptions are each X_j is separable. Each X_j having a countable dense subset is a consequence of being separable, but maybe the problem is using that fact, so should I include it as an assumption or as part of the problem's given?\n\nLooking at the example provided: In the original problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be extracted from the problem statement as given, but maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Let me check again.\n\nThe example original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But maybe the original problem had a typo, or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to follow the format as per the user's example, which in that case included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem's statement. So perhaps the user expects to extract assumptions that are implicit or perhaps even correct the problem. But in this case, the current problem is about proving separability of the product, given that each X_j is separable. The problem statement doesn't add extra conditions, so the assumptions should just be that each X_j is separable. The fact that each X_m has a countable dense subset is part of the definition of separability, so maybe that's redundant. However, the problem mentions \"arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset\", so perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. But wait, if a space is separable, by definition it has a countable dense subset. So maybe the problem is just assuming each X_j is separable, and the rest follows from definitions. Therefore, the key assumption is that each X_j is a separable space. But the problem's goal is to show the product has a countable dense subset, using that each X_m has such a subset. So perhaps the assumptions should list that each X_j is separable, and that each X_j has a countable dense subset (though technically that's redundant, but maybe the user wants to make it explicit). Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the user is told to assume each X_j has a countable dense subset, and the problem is to show the product is separable. Wait, the original question says: \"The goal is to prove that the infinite cartesian product of separable spaces is indeed separable by showing that the product has a countable dense subset, arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" So the problem is structured as: given each X_j is separable (hence has a countable dense subset), show the product is separable by constructing a countable dense subset. Therefore, the main assumption is that each X_j is separable. The fact that each has a countable dense subset is part of the definition. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach X_j is a separable space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable by showing it has a countable dense subset.\n\nBut the original problem's wording says \"using density\", but perhaps the problem as formatted should just state the problem. Alternatively, the problem might need to be phrased as proving separability via existence of a countable dense subset, using the fact that each X_m has one. But according to the example, the problem part is just the statement to prove. So in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions included n being integer and divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Anyway, the user's instruction is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption 1: Each X_j in the sequence {X_j}_{j=1}^∞ is a separable space.\n\nSince each X_j is separable, by definition it has a countable dense subset. But the problem's goal is to construct a countable dense subset for the product. Therefore, the problem part is to prove that the infinite product is separable, i.e., has a countable dense subset. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nEach X_j in the sequence {X_j}_{j=1}^{∞} is a separable space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable by showing it has a countable dense subset.\n\nWait, but the original problem's phrasing includes \"arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset\". Should that be included in the problem statement? The example didn't include such specifics. The example's problem was just \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the problem part here should just state the main goal: \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of separable spaces is separable.\" But the original question adds \"by showing that the product has a countable dense subset, arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" So maybe the problem part should include the method. But according to the user's example, the problem part is concise. Let me check the user's example again.\n\nOriginal problem example: The user's formatted problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So the problem is the main statement to prove, and the assumptions are the conditions on n. Therefore, for the current problem, the problem part should be \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\" But the original question adds \"by showing that the product has a countable dense subset arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" So perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of separable spaces is separable by demonstrating the existence of a countable dense subset constructed from the countable dense subsets of each X_m.\" But the example didn't include the method in the problem statement. The example's problem was just the statement to prove. So perhaps the problem part here is just \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\" However, the original question's goal is to do it by showing the product has a countable dense subset. Maybe the problem should include that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show the product has a countable dense subset, which would imply separability. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j has a countable dense subset.\" Because in topology, a space is separable if it has a countable dense subset. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to proving separability by showing the existence of such a subset.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is stated as the main claim. So the problem part here is \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of separable spaces is separable by showing that the product has a countable dense subset arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" But maybe that's too verbose. The example had just the main statement. The original problem's title is \"Proving separability of the countable product of separable spaces using density.\" So perhaps the problem is to prove separability via constructing a dense subset. But the formatted problem should capture the essence. Given the example, it's better to state the problem concisely as \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\" But the original question specifies \"by showing that the product has a countable dense subset...\", which might be part of the problem's requirement. However, in the user's example, the problem part was just the statement to prove, not the method. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\" The method (by showing a countable dense subset) is part of the solution, not the problem statement. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nEach X_j in the sequence {X_j}_{j=1}^{∞} is a separable space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement mentions \"showing that the product has a countable dense subset, arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" So perhaps the problem is more specific: not just to prove separability, but to do so by constructing a countable dense subset from those of the factors. In that case, the problem part should reflect that. For example, \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j has a countable dense subset, using the countable dense subsets of each X_m.\" But in the example, the problem was a statement to prove, not including the method. However, the user's example might have been incorrect. Given the ambiguity, perhaps it's safer to include the method in the problem statement if the original question specifies it. The original question says: \"The goal is to prove that the infinite cartesian product of separable spaces is indeed separable by showing that the product has a countable dense subset, arising from the fact that each X_m has a countably dense subset.\" So the problem is to prove separability by demonstrating a countable dense subset constructed from the dense subsets of each X_m. Therefore, the problem statement should include that aspect. So the problem part would be: \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable by showing it has a countable dense subset constructed from the countable dense subsets of each X_m.\" But to keep it concise, maybe: \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j has a countable dense subset, arising from the countable dense subsets of each X_m.\" However, the term \"arising from\" might be too vague. Alternatively, \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable by constructing a countable dense subset from the countable dense subsets of each X_j.\" That seems better. But according to the user's example, the problem is just the statement to prove, without the method. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, not mentioning the method (like using modular arithmetic). Therefore, perhaps the problem part here should simply state the main result: \"Prove that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\" Even though the original question mentions the method, but according to the example, the problem part is the claim. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nEach X_j in the sequence {X_j}_{j=1}^{∞} is a separable space.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the infinite Cartesian product of the spaces X_j is separable.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement includes the method (\"by showing...\"). However, in the user's example, the formatted problem didn't include the method. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was the same, with added assumptions. Therefore, following that pattern, the problem here is to prove the product is separable, and the assumption is each X_j is separable. The method (constructing a dense subset) is part of the solution, not the problem statement. Hence, the correct formatted problem is as above.",
