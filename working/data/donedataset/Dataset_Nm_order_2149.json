    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that 10! equals 6!7! using the Gamma function, specifically by showing that the product of two Gamma integrals equals another Gamma integral. Let me parse the question step by step.\n\nFirst, the Gamma function is defined as Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ x^{n-1} e^{-x} dx. So for integers, Γ(n) = (n-1)! That’s key here. The problem mentions equation (1): Γ(8) * Γ(7) = Γ(11), since 10! = Γ(11), 6! = Γ(7), and 7! = Γ(8). Wait, actually, 10! = Γ(11) because Γ(n) = (n-1)! So yes, Γ(8) is 7! and Γ(7) is 6!, so their product should equal Γ(11) which is 10!. So equation (1) is Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11). The user wants to show this equality via manipulating the integrals directly, not just by recognizing the factorial relationship.\n\nThe user rewrote the left-hand side (LHS) of equation (1) as a double integral in equation (2): ∫∫ x(xy)^6 e^{-(x+y)} dx dy. Let me check that. The original LHS is Γ(8)Γ(7) = ∫₀^∞ x^7 e^{-x} dx * ∫₀^∞ y^6 e^{-y} dy. If we combine these into a double integral, it becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ x^7 y^6 e^{-x - y} dx dy. The user's equation (2) is ∫∫ x (xy)^6 e^{-(x+y)} dx dy. Let's compute that: x*(xy)^6 = x*(x^6 y^6) = x^7 y^6, which matches the original. So equation (2) is correct as the product of the two Gamma functions expressed as a double integral.\n\nNow, the user tried substitution u = x + y, v = xy, but found it complicated. They’re looking for a substitution that can transform the double integral into the single Gamma integral Γ(11) = ∫₀^∞ z^{10} e^{-z} dz.\n\nSo, the task is to manipulate the double integral ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ x^7 y^6 e^{-x - y} dx dy into a single integral that equals Γ(11). Let's think about possible substitutions. In such cases, a common technique is to use a substitution that relates x and y to a new variable, often scaling one variable with respect to the other. For instance, setting t = x + y, or perhaps a substitution involving ratios like x = t*z and y = (1 - z)*t or something similar. Let me recall that in Beta function integrals, we often use substitutions like t = x/(x+y), which can convert the region of integration into something manageable. But here, the product of Gamma functions can be related to Beta function, but maybe we need a different approach.\n\nWait, the Gamma function has the property that Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(a+b) B(a,b) where B is the Beta function. But here, the user wants to show Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11), which would require B(8,7) = 1, but B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b), so Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15) = B(8,7). But Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15) is not equal to 1, which contradicts the desired equality. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in their approach? Wait, but the original problem states that 10! = 6!7! which is actually true because 10! = 720*5040 = 3628800, and 6!7! = 720*5040 = 3628800. So numerically, it's correct. But via Gamma functions, Γ(8)Γ(7) = 7!6! = 5040*720 = 3,628,800 and Γ(11) = 10! = 3,628,800. So indeed, Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11). But according to the Gamma-Beta relation, Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(a+b) B(a,b). So here, Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(15) B(8,7). But Γ(15) is 14! which is way larger than Γ(11). Hence, there's a contradiction unless B(8,7) = Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15) which is a very small number, so this seems conflicting with the problem's assertion that Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11). Therefore, the initial approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe the problem is being misrepresented? The user says they want to prove 10! = 6!7! via Gamma function. But Γ(n) = (n-1)!, so 10! = Γ(11), 7! = Γ(8), 6! = Γ(7). So the equation is Γ(11) = Γ(8)Γ(7). But according to the standard Gamma function identity, Γ(a)Γ(b) ≠ Γ(a + b) in general. So there must be some mistake here, but the numerical values do match. Wait, Γ(8)Γ(7) = 7!6! = 5040 * 720 = 3,628,800, and Γ(11) = 10! = 3,628,800. So numerically, they are equal, but this is a coincidence. The identity Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(a + b) would only hold if either a or b is zero, which is not the case here. So how come 7!6! equals 10!? Because 10! = 10×9×8×7! = 720×7! = 6!×7! since 6! = 720. So 10! = 6!×7! because 10×9×8 = 720 = 6!.\n\nSo algebraically, 10! = 10×9×8×7! = (10×9×8)×7! = 720×7! = 6!×7! because 6! = 720. Therefore, the equality holds due to the specific numerical values, not because of a general Gamma function identity. Therefore, the user wants to prove this specific equality through manipulating the integrals. But the standard Gamma function identity doesn't support Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(c) unless under specific conditions. Therefore, the approach must involve a particular substitution that, for these specific parameters, allows the double integral to collapse into the single integral.\n\nSo, returning to the problem: how to transform the double integral ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ x^7 y^6 e^{-x - y} dx dy into ∫₀^∞ z^{10} e^{-z} dz. Let me think about variable substitution. Perhaps we can set z = x + y, and another variable, say t = x/(x + y). Let's try that. Let u = x + y, and v = x/(x + y). Then, x = u v, y = u (1 - v). The Jacobian determinant for this substitution is u. The limits of integration become u from 0 to ∞ and v from 0 to 1. Let's substitute into the integral.\n\nOriginal integral: x^7 y^6 e^{-(x + y)} dx dy.\n\nExpressed in terms of u and v:\n\nx = u v, y = u (1 - v), so x^7 y^6 = (u v)^7 (u (1 - v))^6 = u^{7 + 6} v^7 (1 - v)^6 = u^{13} v^7 (1 - v)^6.\n\nThe exponent e^{-(x + y)} = e^{-u}.\n\nThe Jacobian determinant is u, so dx dy = u du dv.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^1 u^{13} v^7 (1 - v)^6 e^{-u} * u dv du.\n\nSimplify: ∫₀^∞ u^{14} e^{-u} du ∫₀^1 v^7 (1 - v)^6 dv.\n\nNow, the integral over u is Γ(15), since Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ u^{n-1} e^{-u} du. So ∫ u^{14} e^{-u} du = Γ(15) = 14!.\n\nThe integral over v is the Beta function B(8,7), since B(a,b) = ∫₀^1 v^{a-1} (1 - v)^{b-1} dv. So ∫ v^7 (1 - v)^6 dv = B(8,7) = Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15).\n\nTherefore, the double integral is Γ(15) * Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15) = Γ(8)Γ(7).\n\nBut we were supposed to show that this equals Γ(11), which is 10!. However, Γ(8)Γ(7) = 7!6! = 5040*720 = 3,628,800, and Γ(11) = 10! = 3,628,800. So numerically, they are equal, but analytically, we have Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11) only if Γ(15) B(8,7) = Γ(11), which is not true. Wait, but in our calculation, the double integral equals Γ(8)Γ(7), which we know equals Γ(11) numerically. So this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, this suggests that the double integral is Γ(8)Γ(7), which is equal to Γ(11), but analytically, Γ(8)Γ(7) is not equal to Γ(11). However, numerically, for these specific integers, it works. So the problem is to show via integral manipulation that Γ(8)Γ(7) equals Γ(11), which is only true because of the specific numbers chosen. Therefore, the substitution approach must exploit the numerical coincidence that Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11).\n\nBut how to manipulate the integral to get there? The user tried substitution u = x + y, v = xy, but found it complicated. Maybe another substitution. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a change of variables where one variable is scaled by the other. Let's set t = x + y, and s = x/(x + y). Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier. Alternatively, let’s set z = x + y, and keep one variable as x or y. Let’s try setting z = x + y, and let x = t. Then y = z - t. The Jacobian determinant is 1, so dx dy = dz dt. The limits would be t from 0 to z, and z from 0 to ∞. So the double integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^z x^7 (z - x)^6 e^{-z} dx dz.\n\nLet’s check: x^7 y^6 e^{-(x + y)} becomes x^7 (z - x)^6 e^{-z}, and integrating over x from 0 to z and z from 0 to ∞. Now, the integral over x is ∫₀^z x^7 (z - x)^6 dx. Let’s make a substitution in the inner integral. Let u = x/z, so x = zu, dx = z du. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^1 (zu)^7 (z - zu)^6 z du = z^{7 + 6 + 1} ∫₀^1 u^7 (1 - u)^6 du = z^{14} B(8,7). Therefore, the entire double integral becomes ∫₀^∞ z^{14} e^{-z} B(8,7) dz = B(8,7) Γ(15). Which is the same as before: Γ(8)Γ(7).\n\nBut we need this to equal Γ(11). So unless B(8,7) Γ(15) = Γ(11), which is not true, unless there's a miscalculation. Wait, but we have Γ(8)Γ(7) = B(8,7) Γ(15), and Γ(8)Γ(7) = 7!6! = Γ(11) = 10!. Therefore, this implies that B(8,7) Γ(15) = Γ(11), which numerically holds because Γ(15) is 14! = 87178291200, and B(8,7) = Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15) = (5040 * 720)/87178291200 = 3628800 / 87178291200 = 1/24024. Then 24024 * 3628800 = 87178291200, which matches. But how does this help in showing the original equality via integrals?\n\nPerhaps the key is that the problem is a specific case where the Beta function cancels out the Γ(15) term. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a different substitution. Let me think differently. Suppose we consider the product of the two Gamma functions as a double integral and then perform a substitution that combines x and y into a single variable z. For example, setting z = x + y and another variable related to the ratio between x and y. Let me try that again.\n\nLet’s set z = x + y and t = x/(x + y). Then, as before, x = z t, y = z (1 - t), Jacobian is z. The double integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^1 (z t)^7 (z (1 - t))^6 e^{-z} z dt dz. Simplifying:\n\n(z t)^7 * (z (1 - t))^6 = z^{7+6} t^7 (1 - t)^6 = z^{13} t^7 (1 - t)^6.\n\nMultiply by the Jacobian z: z^{13} * z = z^{14}.\n\nSo the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ z^{14} e^{-z} dz ∫₀^1 t^7 (1 - t)^6 dt = Γ(15) B(8,7).\n\nBut we need this to equal Γ(11). However, Γ(15) B(8,7) = Γ(8)Γ(7) which equals Γ(11) numerically but not analytically. Therefore, the substitution shows that the double integral is Γ(8)Γ(7), which is equal to Γ(11) in this specific case because 7!6! = 10!.\n\nBut the user wants to transform the double integral directly into the single integral Γ(11). So perhaps there's a substitution that allows the double integral to be expressed as a single integral in the form of Γ(11). How?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original double integral is Γ(8)Γ(7) = 7!6! = 720*5040 = 3628800 = 10! = Γ(11). Therefore, the equality holds numerically, but to show it via the integrals, perhaps we need to find a substitution that maps the variables x and y to a single variable z such that the double integral collapses to the single integral. This might involve a clever change of variables where z is a function of x and y that simplifies the exponent and the integrand.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Suppose we set u = x + y and v = x/y (or y/x). Let's try v = x/y. Then x = v y, and substituting into the integral. But I need to express everything in terms of u and v. Alternatively, let’s set z = x + y and w = x. Then y = z - w, and the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^z w^7 (z - w)^6 e^{-z} dw dz. As before, integrating over w first, which gives a polynomial in z times e^{-z}, then integrating over z.\n\nThe inner integral ∫₀^z w^7 (z - w)^6 dw. Let’s make substitution t = w/z, so w = z t, dw = z dt. The integral becomes ∫₀^1 (z t)^7 (z - z t)^6 z dt = z^{14} ∫₀^1 t^7 (1 - t)^6 dt = z^{14} B(8,7). Then the outer integral is ∫₀^∞ z^{14} e^{-z} B(8,7) dz = B(8,7) Γ(15). But this brings us back to the same point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that B(8,7) = 1/24024 and Γ(15) = 14!, and 14! / 24024 = 10! because 14! = 14×13×12×11×10! and 24024 = 14×13×12×11. Let’s check: 14×13×12×11 = 24024. Yes, so 14! = 24024 × 10! Therefore, Γ(15) = 14! = 24024 × 10!, so B(8,7) Γ(15) = (1/24024) × 24024 × 10! = 10! = Γ(11). Therefore, the substitution shows that the double integral equals Γ(11), which is the desired result.\n\nBut this relies on recognizing that B(8,7) Γ(15) = Γ(11), which is a numerical coincidence for these specific parameters. Therefore, the integral manipulation does show the equality, but it requires understanding the relationship between the Beta and Gamma functions for these specific values. However, the user might be looking for a substitution that directly transforms the double integral into the single integral without passing through the Beta function explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to use the convolution theorem or properties of Gamma functions under certain transformations. For example, the Gamma function Γ(n) is the nth moment of the exponential distribution. The product of two Gamma functions might relate to the convolution of two such distributions, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The integral ∫₀^∞ x^7 e^{-x} dx ∫₀^∞ y^6 e^{-y} dy = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ x^7 y^6 e^{-(x+y)} dx dy. If we set z = x + y, then perhaps express the integral in terms of z and another variable. Let’s define z = x + y and t = x. Then, y = z - t, and the limits become t from 0 to z, z from 0 to ∞. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^z t^7 (z - t)^6 e^{-z} dt dz. Now, if we can evaluate the inner integral ∫₀^z t^7 (z - t)^6 dt, which is a polynomial in z of degree 13, multiplied by e^{-z}, and then integrate over z. However, the result would need to simplify to z^{10} e^{-z}. That seems unlikely unless the coefficients align in a specific way.\n\nBut wait, let's compute the inner integral. Let’s make the substitution u = t/z, so t = zu, dt = z du. The inner integral becomes ∫₀^1 (zu)^7 (z - zu)^6 z du = z^{14} ∫₀^1 u^7 (1 - u)^6 du = z^{14} B(8,7). So the entire integral becomes ∫₀^∞ z^{14} B(8,7) e^{-z} dz = B(8,7) Γ(15). As before, and since B(8,7) = Γ(8)Γ(7)/Γ(15), this becomes Γ(8)Γ(7), which equals Γ(11) in this specific case.\n\nTherefore, the substitution shows that the double integral equals Γ(8)Γ(7), which equals Γ(11) because of the numerical values, but this relies on recognizing that 7!6! = 10!.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different substitution that can directly relate the double integral to the single integral without passing through the Beta function. For instance, maybe a substitution that combines x and y into z such that the integrand's exponents add up correctly. Let’s consider scaling variables. Suppose we set z = x + y and w = x/z. Then x = wz, y = (1 - w)z. The Jacobian is z. The double integral becomes ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^1 (wz)^7 ((1 - w)z)^6 e^{-z} z dw dz = ∫₀^∞ z^{13 + 1} e^{-z} dz ∫₀^1 w^7 (1 - w)^6 dw = Γ(14) B(8,7). But Γ(14) = 13! and B(8,7) = 7!6!/13! So Γ(14) B(8,7) = 13! * (7!6!/13!) = 7!6! = Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11). So again, this substitution leads us back to the same conclusion.\n\nThus, all substitutions that combine x and y into a sum lead us to expressing the double integral as Γ(8)Γ(7), which equals Γ(11) numerically. Therefore, the key step is recognizing that for these specific parameters, the product of the two Gamma functions equals another Gamma function due to the factorial relationship 10! = 6!7!.\n\nHowever, the user might be expecting a substitution that directly makes the double integral resemble the single integral Γ(11). Perhaps if we consider the convolution of two Gamma distributions. The Gamma distribution with shape parameter k is f(x; k) = x^{k-1} e^{-x} / Γ(k). The convolution of two Gamma distributions with shape parameters a and b is a Gamma distribution with shape parameter a + b, but this is only true when the rate parameters are the same (which they are here, both 1). Therefore, the convolution of Γ(a) and Γ(b) is Γ(a + b), which implies that ∫₀^∞ x^{a-1} e^{-x} dx ∫₀^∞ y^{b-1} e^{-y} dy = Γ(a)Γ(b) = Γ(a + b) B(a,b), but this doesn’t directly help unless we have a specific relation between a and b.\n\nBut in this problem, a = 8 and b = 7, so a + b = 15, but we need to get to Γ(11). This seems inconsistent. However, the numerical coincidence allows Γ(8)Γ(7) = Γ(11), which isn't a general identity but holds here because 7!6! = 10!.\n\nGiven all this, the answer to the user's question is that by using the substitution u = x + y and v = x/(x + y), the double integral can be transformed into a product of the Beta function and the Gamma function, which simplifies to Γ(8)Γ(7), and since 7!6! = 10!, this equals Γ(11). Therefore, the integral manipulation shows the desired equality.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The assumptions are about the properties of the integrals and the Gamma function. However, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond using algebraic manipulations of the Gamma function. The problem is to show that the product of the two Gamma integrals equals the third Gamma integral.\n\nThe user's example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are implicit in the use of the Gamma function for factorial relationships. However, since the problem is to manipulate the integrals, the assumptions would relate to the variables of integration and the substitutions used. But since the original question doesn't specify additional constraints beyond the integral definitions, perhaps the only assumption is the definition of the Gamma function.\n\nBut the user might not have any specific assumptions beyond the standard Gamma function properties. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions section might be minimal. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that example, assumptions are specific conditions on n. In the current problem, the original question doesn't state any conditions; it's about showing an equality via Gamma function integrals. Therefore, the assumptions might relate to the variables being integrated over the positive reals and the substitutions made. However, since the problem is structured as per the user's instruction, the assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the Gamma function definitions, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\nEach Gamma function is defined as an integral from 0 to ∞,\nThe variables x and y are independent in the double integral,\nThe substitution variables u and v transform the double integral appropriately.\n\nBut the example's assumptions are about the problem's variables (n is integer, divisible by 7). In the current problem, the objects are the integrals and their variables. However, since the problem is to show an equality of integrals via substitution, the assumptions might be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Gamma function is defined as ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt,\nThe variables x and y are positive real numbers,\nThe substitution u = x + y and v = x/(x + y) is valid.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object each. Perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nΓ(n) = ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt,\nx and y are real positive variables,\nz is a real positive variable.\n\nBut these are more definitions than assumptions. The original problem doesn't have explicit conditions; it's a direct equality to prove via integrals. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is minimal, just the definitions required. But following the example, where assumptions were about n, here the problem might have no specific assumptions beyond the definitions. However, the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, the original example problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have that assumption. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nBut this seems like a mistake because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. The formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Perhaps this was an error in the example. Therefore, the user's example might be incorrect, but we need to follow their format.\n\nAssuming that in the example, the user mistakenly added the divisible by 7 assumption, but we need to follow their instruction to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format\".\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to show that 10! =6!7! via Gamma function by proving the integral equality. There are no explicit assumptions beyond the definitions of the Gamma functions. However, the problem might involve assumptions about the substitution variables or the validity of the substitution. But according to the example, assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's premise.\n\nAlternatively, since the example included assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), perhaps in this case, the assistant should list the necessary assumptions to make the problem well-defined. For instance, in the current problem, the assumptions could be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Gamma function is defined as ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt,\nThe variables x, y, z are positive real numbers,\nThe substitutions used are valid under integral calculus.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the mathematical tools used. Therefore, perhaps in this case, since the problem is about Gamma functions and integrals, the assumptions are about the variables being integrated over the positive reals. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\ny is a positive real number,\nz is a positive real number.\n\nBut these are more about the variables' domains. Alternatively, since the problem involves equating two integrals, the assumptions could be the definitions of the Gamma functions involved. However, the example's assumptions were about the problem's variables (n is integer, etc.). Given that, and considering the user's instruction to \"filter the unrelated informations\", the assumptions here would be the conditions on the variables in the integrals, which are that they are positive real numbers. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n in the expression A(n). Following that, here the assumptions would be about the variables in the integrals, but since the integrals are over positive reals, that's implicit. Maybe the assumptions are empty, but the example shows that even obvious assumptions are listed. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe variables x, y, z are real numbers.\n\nBut the example listed assumptions about n, which was the variable in the problem. Here, the variables are integration variables, so perhaps it's redundant to list them. However, following the example's style, even if redundant, list them. Alternatively, since the problem is to equate integrals, perhaps no specific assumptions beyond the Gamma function definitions. But the example included assumptions that weren't in the original problem, so maybe the assistant should extract any implicit assumptions. Given the original question, the only assumption is the definition of the Gamma function, but the user's example added assumptions about the variable n. Therefore, in this case, the formatted problem would have assumptions related to the Gamma function's integral definition and perhaps the variables' domains.\n\nBut to align with the example, where the assumptions were about the problem's variable (n), here, since the problem is about integrals, the variables x, y, z are integration variables, so their domains are [0, ∞). But in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem doesn't have such conditions; it's a general equality. Therefore, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the Gamma function definitions, which are part of the problem statement. Hence, the assumptions section might be empty, but since the example includes assumptions, maybe we need to list the integral definitions as assumptions. However, the original problem states the integrals explicitly, so they are part of the problem, not assumptions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where assumptions were extracted from the problem (even if not explicitly stated), perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Gamma function is defined as an integral from 0 to ∞,\nThe variables x, y, z are positive real numbers.\n\nBut the problem already states the integrals, so these are part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem, so the assumptions section is empty. However, the example included assumptions even when the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Therefore, following that, perhaps list:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are positive real numbers,\nThe integrals are computed over [0, ∞).\n\nBut I think the intended format is to list any conditions or properties that are prerequisites for the problem. Since the problem is to show an equality of integrals defined via Gamma functions, the assumptions would be the definitions of the Gamma functions as integrals. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n, not about the functions used. Therefore, to stay consistent, the assumptions here might be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe factorial function can be expressed via the Gamma function,\nThe Gamma function is defined as Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt.\n\nBut again, these are part of the problem's context, not assumptions. Given the confusion, and to align with the example where assumptions were about the problem's variables, here, since there are no variables with conditions (like n being integer), the assumptions section might be minimal. However, the original problem does state that the equality should be proven via algebraic manipulations of the Gamma function, implying that the Gamma function's integral representation is an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Gamma function is defined as Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$ \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} x^7 e^{-x} \\, dx \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} y^6 e^{-y} \\, dy = \\int_{0}^{+\\infty} z^{10} e^{-z} \\, dz $$ via algebraic manipulations of the Gamma function.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed as bullet points. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, the only assumption is the definition of the Gamma function. Alternatively, since the problem involves multiple integrals, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product of two Gamma functions can be expressed as a double integral,\nThe variables x, y, z are positive real numbers.\n\nBut these are more like steps in the solution than assumptions. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to format the problem with the minimal necessary assumptions based on the example, even if they are part of the problem statement.",
