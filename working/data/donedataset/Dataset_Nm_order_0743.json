    "Content": "I'm interested in evaluating integrals of positive integer powers of the dilogarithm function. I'd like to see the general case tackled if possible, or barring that then as many particular cases as possible. Problem. For each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, evaluate the definite integral $\\mathcal{I}_n$:\n  $$\\mathcal{I}_n:=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}\\right]^n\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\,???$$ The first two cases aren't that difficult to evaluate, but for reference I'll just state their values without proof: $$\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n&=\\zeta{(2)}-1\\\\\n&=0.6449340668482264\\dots;\n\\end{align}$$ and $$\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n&=\\frac52\\zeta{(4)}-4\\zeta{(3)}-2\\zeta{(2)}+6\\\\\n&=0.6077123379430154\\dots.\n\\end{align}$$ The next case, $n=3$, is much harder than the previous two. However, by combining my answer to this question with Omran Kouba's answer to the same question, and assuming both answers are correct, I was able to infer that $$\\zeta{(5)}+6\\zeta{(3)}+\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}-15=\\frac{1}{3!}\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}-\\zeta{(2)}\\right]^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x.$$ Then by using the Binomial Theorem to expand the integrand on the RHS and by using the previous values of $\\mathcal{I}_n$ for $n<3$, I was able to solve for the integral $\\mathcal{I}_3$ and find the following value: $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{I}_3\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=6\\zeta{(5)}+36\\zeta{(3)}+\\frac{\\pi^6}{216}+\\frac{19\\pi^4}{60}+3\\pi^2-2\\pi^2\\zeta{(3)}-90\\\\\n&=0.6738641012555397\\dots.\n\\end{align}$$ But surely there is a less circuitous way to prove this. Can anybody offer a more direct proof that the integral $\\mathcal{I}_3$ has the conjectured value indicated above? Prove: $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\stackrel{?}{=}6\\zeta{(5)}+36\\zeta{(3)}+\\frac{\\pi^6}{216}+\\frac{19\\pi^4}{60}+3\\pi^2-2\\pi^2\\zeta{(3)}-90.$$ And finally, what of the $n>3$ cases? What is the largest $n$ for which $\\mathcal{I}_n$ can be evaluated? Can $\\mathcal{I}_4$ be evaluated? At the bottom of Omran Kouba's response to the question I referred to above, he says that, to his knowledge, the values of the integral of integer powers of the dilogarithm for powers larger than $2$ are not known. Clearly, for that statement to be true then, at the very least, it would have to be amended to reflect the fact that the value of the integral of the third power of the dilogarithm is indeed known (assuming I'm not somehow the first person to know it!). But are the values for $n>3$ really unknown? Update: As SuperAbound was able to show, finding $\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ via repreated integration by parts actually isn't that difficult at all! For comparison, let's see how much harder finding $\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^4\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ is if we try to recycle the same method. To evaluate $\\int_0^1\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^4\\mathrm{d}x$, integrate by parts using $$\\frac{d}{dx}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^{4}=-\\frac{4\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3}{x}.$$ Then, $$\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{I}_4\n&=\\int_{0}^{1}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^4\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\left[x\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^4\\right]_{0}^{1}-\\int_{0}^{1}x\\left(-\\frac{4\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3}{x}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\operatorname{Li}_2{(1)}^4+4\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=\\zeta{(2)}^4+4\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x.\n\\end{align}$$ Next, evaluate $\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x$ by integrating by parts again using $$\\int\\ln{(1-x)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x=(x-1)\\ln{(1-x)}-x+constant,$$ $$\\frac{d}{dx}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3=-\\frac{3\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2}{x}.$$ Then, $$\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\,\\mathrm{d}x\n&=\\left[\\left((x-1)\\ln{(1-x)}-x\\right)\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^3\\right]_{0}^{1}\\\\\n&~~~~~-\\int_{0}^{1}\\left((x-1)\\ln{(1-x)}-x\\right)\\left(-\\frac{3\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2}{x}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=-\\operatorname{Li}_2{(1)}^3\\\\\n&~~~~~-3\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[\\frac{\\ln^2{(1-x)}}{x}-\\ln^2{(1-x)}+\\ln{(1-x)}\\right]\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&=-\\zeta{(2)}^3-3\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\ln^2{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2}{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\\\\n&~~~~~+3\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln^2{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x-3\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x.\n\\end{align}$$ The third integral in the last line above has the value, $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\ln{(1-x)}\\operatorname{Li}_2{(x)}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x=2\\zeta{(5)}+\\frac{19}{2}\\zeta{(4)}+12\\zeta{(3)}+6\\zeta{(2)}-4\\zeta{(3)}\\zeta{(2)}-30.$$ (to be continued...)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a reasonably easy way to do these integrals. Above all, it is systematic . Each dilogarithm\ncan be written as an iterated integral $$ L(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{dt}{t}\\int_0^t\\frac{du}{1-u}. $$ Every power of a dilogarithm can then be expanded into a long product\nof integrals, giving, as an example: $$ \\int_0^1 L(x)^2\\,dx = \\int_0^1dx \\int_0^x \\frac{dt_1}{t_1}\n\\int_0^{t_1}\\frac{du_1}{1-u_1}  \\int_0^x \\frac{dt_2}{t_2}\n\\int_0^{t_2}\\frac{du_2}{1-u_2}. $$ The reason this is easy is that one integral representation of multiple zeta\nvalues has the form $$ \\int_0^1\n\\frac{dw_1}{w_1-b_1}\\int_0^{w_1}\\frac{dw_2}{w_2-b_2}\\cdots\\int_0^{w_{n-1}}\\frac{dw_n}{w_n-b_n}, $$ where $b_j\\in\\{0,1\\}$ . In the case of $\\int L(x)^n$ , the domain of the integral is $$ 0< t_1,\\ldots,t_n < x < 1, \\qquad 0 < u_j < t_j, $$ which can be rearranged into a union of simplices of the form $$ 0<w_{2n}<\\cdots<w_{1}<x<1, $$ (where $w_j$ 's are all of $t_j$ 's and $u_j$ 's in some order), and the integral over\neach simplex has the form $$ \\int_0^1dx\\,\\Omega, $$ where $\\Omega$ is an iterated integral expression, starting with\neither $\\int_0^x \\frac{dw_1}{w_1}$ or $\\int_0^x \\frac{dw_1}{1-w_1}$ . It is easy to interchange the order of integration of $x$ and $w_1$ ,\nintegrate over $x$ , and be left with a very similar integral over\nanother simplex with only the variables $w_2,\\ldots,w_{2n}$ present. Implementing this recursive procedure gives the following expressions\nfor $I$ : $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nI_1 &=&\n\\zeta(2) - 1\n\\\\I_2 &=&\n-2\\zeta(2) - 4\\zeta(2,1) + 2\\zeta(2,2) + 4\\zeta(3,1) + 6\n\\\\I_3 &=&\n18\\zeta(2) + 36\\zeta(2,1) + 36\\zeta(2,1,1) - 12\\zeta(2,1,2) - 6\\zeta(2,2) - 24\\zeta(2,2,1) + 6\\zeta(2,2,2) + 12\\zeta(2,3,1) - 12\\zeta(3,1) - 36\\zeta(3,1,1) + 12\\zeta(3,1,2) + 24\\zeta(3,2,1) + 36\\zeta(4,1,1) - 90\n\\\\I_4 &=&\n-360\\zeta(2) - 720\\zeta(2,1) - 864\\zeta(2,1,1) - 576\\zeta(2,1,1,1) + 144\\zeta(2,1,1,2) + 144\\zeta(2,1,2) + 288\\zeta(2,1,2,1) - 48\\zeta(2,1,2,2) - 96\\zeta(2,1,3,1) + 72\\zeta(2,2) + 288\\zeta(2,2,1) + 432\\zeta(2,2,1,1) - 96\\zeta(2,2,1,2) - 24\\zeta(2,2,2) - 192\\zeta(2,2,2,1) + 24\\zeta(2,2,2,2) + 48\\zeta(2,2,3,1) - 48\\zeta(2,3,1) - 288\\zeta(2,3,1,1) + 48\\zeta(2,3,1,2) + 96\\zeta(2,3,2,1) + 144\\zeta(2,4,1,1) + 144\\zeta(3,1) + 432\\zeta(3,1,1) + 576\\zeta(3,1,1,1) - 144\\zeta(3,1,1,2) - 48\\zeta(3,1,2) - 288\\zeta(3,1,2,1) + 48\\zeta(3,1,2,2) + 96\\zeta(3,1,3,1) - 96\\zeta(3,2,1) - 432\\zeta(3,2,1,1) + 96\\zeta(3,2,1,2) + 192\\zeta(3,2,2,1) + 288\\zeta(3,3,1,1) - 144\\zeta(4,1,1) - 576\\zeta(4,1,1,1) + 144\\zeta(4,1,1,2) + 288\\zeta(4,1,2,1) + 432\\zeta(4,2,1,1) + 576\\zeta(5,1,1,1) + 2520\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ I computed these values up to $n=8$ , but the expressions are long\n( $I_5$ has 428 terms), and the integers involved become\nprohibitively large, so I didn't include them here. For small $n$ , at least up to $n=4$ , I found numerically that the above expressions can be written in terms of ordinary zeta values, as follows: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\\def\\tfrac#1#2{{\\textstyle\\frac{#1}{#2}}}\nI_1 &=&\n\\zeta(2) - 1\n\\\\I_2 &=&\n-4 \\zeta (3)-2 \\zeta (2)+\\tfrac{5}{2} \\zeta (4)+6\n\\\\I_3 &=&\n-12 \\zeta (3) \\zeta (2)+6 \\zeta (5)+36 \\zeta (3)+18 \\zeta (2)+\\tfrac{57}{2} \\zeta (4)+\\tfrac{35}{8} \\zeta (6)-90\n\\\\I_4 &=&\n24 \\zeta (5) \\zeta (2)+144 \\zeta (3) \\zeta (2)+84 \\zeta (3) \\zeta (4)-195 \\zeta (7)-648 \\zeta (5)+144 \\zeta (3)^2-720 \\zeta (3)-360 \\zeta (2)-774 \\zeta (4)-\\frac{11}{2} \\zeta (6)+\\frac{175}{24} \\zeta (8)+2520\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ I checked $n\\leq3$ using known identities satisfied by MZVs, such as those here . For $I_4$ , while this is not a proof that the expression is correct, this entire procedure reduces the problem of evaluating the integrals $I_n$ to the problem of applying known identities to multiple zeta values, which is more straightforward. A quick integer relation search for a closed form for $I_5$ gave me nothing. There may or may not be a closed form for $I_5$ (I believe this is not\na settled question), but there is no systematic way to reduce multiple\nzeta values to ordinary zeta values. For example, weight 10, which is\nwhat $I_5$ requires, is the first weight at which known relations\nbetween depth-two zeta values are insufficient to reduce them to\nordinary zeta values (\"Euler Sums and Contour Integral\nRepresentations\" by Flajolet and Salvy). Because here the depth can\nbe up to five, this problem is harder. Update (by editor after 6 years): Settled now. By further computation one have $$\\small\\int_0^1 \\text{Li}_2(x){}^5 \\, dx=1440 \\zeta(6,2)+240 \\zeta (3)^3+120 \\pi ^2 \\zeta (3)^2-4320 \\zeta (3)^2-\\frac{23 \\pi ^6 \\zeta (3)}{189}-110 \\pi ^4 \\zeta (3)-600 \\pi ^2 \\zeta (3)-9360 \\zeta (5) \\zeta (3)+25200 \\zeta (3)-\\frac{127 \\pi ^4 \\zeta (5)}{3}-540 \\pi ^2 \\zeta (5)+30600 \\zeta (5)-\\frac{325 \\pi ^2 \\zeta (7)}{2}+14445 \\zeta (7)+\\frac{16495 \\zeta (9)}{3}+\\frac{\\pi ^{10}}{7776}+\\frac{51137 \\pi ^8}{45360}+\\frac{1907 \\pi ^6}{126}+335 \\pi ^4+2100 \\pi ^2-113400$$ Here $ \\zeta(6,2)$ is irreducible. In fact all $I_n$ can be reduced to MZVs. The generalized algorithm I used also gives the proof to closed-form of $I_4$ above.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The format requires listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The main problem is about evaluating definite integrals of integer powers of the dilogarithm function, specifically for each natural number n. The user provided examples for n=1, n=2, and n=3, and is asking for a more direct proof for n=3 and whether higher n cases (like n=4) can be evaluated.\n\nLooking at the example given, the assumptions were about the properties of n. In this case, the problem is for each n in natural numbers. So the key assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to evaluate the integral of [Li₂(x)]^n from 0 to 1. However, in the specific case the user is asking to prove the conjectured value for n=3, which is a particular instance. But the general problem is for any n in natural numbers. However, in the problem statement, the user is focusing on proving the n=3 case and inquiring about higher n. But according to the example, the formatted problem should capture the main problem as stated. The original problem statement starts with \"For each n∈ℕ, evaluate the definite integral...\" So the main problem is the general case, but the specific focus is on n=3. However, the user is asking for both: a proof for n=3 and whether n>3 can be evaluated.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). In this case, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. But wait, in the example, the original problem had n as an integer, and the formatted problem included that assumption. Here, the problem states n∈ℕ, so the assumption is n is a natural number. However, when the user gets to the specific case of n=3, there might not be additional assumptions, but the problem is to evaluate that integral for each n∈ℕ.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"For each n∈ℕ, evaluate the definite integral...\" So the main problem is the general case. However, the user then focuses on n=3, asking for a proof of the conjectured value and whether higher n can be evaluated. But according to the format, the assumption should list all the problem's assumptions. Since the problem is for each natural number n, the key assumption is that n is a natural number. However, when the user is specifically asking about n=3, is there any additional assumption? The problem statement as given in the title and the initial problem mentions integrals of positive integer powers, so n is a positive integer. The specific case for n=3 doesn't add any new assumptions; it's a particular instance of the general problem.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be that n is a natural number. The problem is to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1 of [Li₂(x)]^n dx for each n in natural numbers. But in the specific problem part, the user is asking to prove the value for n=3. However, the example given in the instruction had the problem part as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the original problem is more general but the specific focus is on n=3.\n\nWait, looking at the example again: the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But 91 is 7*13. The user in the example formatted the problem with the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would make the problem to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, that's not what the original problem states. The original problem says for every integer n, which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So the example might be incorrect. But according to the user's instruction, they provided that example. So maybe the user wants to filter out some conditions or the problem was misrepresented. But regardless, we need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is asking for each n∈ℕ, evaluate the integral. So the general problem is for any natural number n. However, in the specific problem part, the user is focusing on proving the case for n=3. Therefore, to structure this, perhaps the assumption is that n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate the integral for each n∈ℕ. However, in the specific problem that the user is asking (the one they want to be formatted), it's to prove the value for n=3. The user writes: \"Prove: ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]³ dx = ...\". So the specific problem is for n=3. But the general problem is for any n∈ℕ. However, the way the example was structured, they took the original problem which was for all integers n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Which seems like maybe there was a mistake, but perhaps the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, the original problem had an error or the user restructured it. Let me check again. The original example problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But the user might have intended that the assumption includes all the conditions in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, there was an unstated assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user included it. But in any case, we have to follow the instruction given.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states that for each n∈ℕ, evaluate the integral. So the key assumption is n∈ℕ. The problem is to evaluate the integral. But the user is focusing on the specific case of n=3 and asking for a proof. However, in the problem statement, the user is also asking about higher n. So how to structure this?\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was general (for every integer n), but the formatted problem focused on a specific case (with n divisible by 7). But in the current problem, the user is combining the general case and a specific case. The user starts by asking for the general case but then focuses on n=3 and n>3.\n\nBut according to the instructions, we need to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter the unrelated information, and structure it into the given format. The format requires listing assumptions and then the problem.\n\nIn the original question, the problem is stated as: For each n∈ℕ, evaluate the definite integral I_n = ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]ⁿ dx.\n\nThen, the user provides specific cases for n=1, 2, 3, and discusses n=4. But the core problem is to evaluate I_n for each natural number n. The user is particularly interested in proving the value for n=3 and whether higher n can be evaluated.\n\nHowever, the example provided by the user in the instruction shows that the formatted problem may include a specific case (like n divisible by 7) even if the original problem was more general. But in this case, the problem is general but the user is focusing on a specific case. However, in the problem statement, the user explicitly asks two things: 1) to prove the conjectured value for n=3, and 2) whether n>3 can be evaluated.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem part should be the problem statement. The original problem is to evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ. However, the specific part the user wants help with is proving the case for n=3 and inquiring about higher n. But in the problem part, perhaps we should state both: the general problem and the specific request. But the example only included the problem part as a single statement.\n\nGiven that the user's example included the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" even though the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe in that example, the user made a mistake, or perhaps they intended to highlight a specific case. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, since the user is focusing on n=3, we should structure the problem as the specific case for n=3, with the assumption that n=3, but that's not an assumption. Alternatively, since n is a natural number, the assumption is n∈ℕ, and the problem is to evaluate I_n, but the specific focus is on n=3.\n\nHowever, the example shows that even if the original problem is general, the formatted problem can be a specific case. So perhaps here, the main problem is the general case, but the user is asking about n=3 and n>3. But according to the instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The problem part should be the main question, and the assumptions are the conditions.\n\nIn the original question, the problem is to evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ. So the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate the integral. However, the user is particularly interested in the case n=3 and n>3. But how to represent that in the format? The example included a specific case with an added assumption. However, in this case, there's no added assumption; the problem is general. So perhaps the assumptions are simply that n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n for each such n.\n\nBut the user also mentions specific values for n=1,2,3 and wants a proof for n=3. So maybe the formatted problem should include both: the general problem and the specific case. But according to the example, they extracted a specific case. But in the example, the original problem was general, but the formatted problem was a specific case. However, in the current problem, the user is asking both the general case and specific proofs. But according to the format, the problem should be structured into assumptions and problem. Since the problem as stated in the original question is \"For each n∈ℕ, evaluate the definite integral...\", the assumption is n∈ℕ, and the problem is to evaluate the integral. However, the user is particularly asking about n=3 and n>3. But maybe the way to structure this is to have the assumption as n∈ℕ and the problem as evaluating I_n, but also mention the specific case for n=3. However, the example shows that in the problem part, it's a single problem statement. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as the general problem, and then the specific case is part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to focus on the specific case of n=3, then the assumption would be n=3, but that's not an assumption; it's a specific value. So perhaps the problem is to evaluate I_n for n∈ℕ, with the assumption being n is a natural number. However, in the example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect, but given that the user provided that example, they might expect a similar approach. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted the problem with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 7^2*13? Wait, maybe there was a miscommunication in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo or the user made a mistake. But regardless, we have to follow the user's example structure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in this case, even though the original problem states for each n∈ℕ, the user is particularly interested in n=3, so the formatted problem could have the assumption as n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n, with a focus on proving the case for n=3. However, the example included an additional assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which may suggest that the user wants to extract key conditions from the problem. But in this case, the only assumption is n∈ℕ. The rest are part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ, but the user has already solved for n=1,2,3 and is asking for n=3 proof and higher n, maybe the problem part is to evaluate I_n for n≥3, but the original problem includes all n∈ℕ. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem as stated by the user on Math Stack Exchange is:\n\n\"For each n∈ℕ, evaluate the definite integral I_n: I_n = ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]^n dx=??? The first two cases... The next case, n=3, is much harder... Can anybody offer a more direct proof that the integral I_3 has the conjectured value...? Prove: ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]³ dx = ... And finally, what of the n>3 cases?\"\n\nSo the problem has two parts: 1) General case for each n∈ℕ, 2) Specific request to prove n=3, and 3) Inquire about n>3. But the way to structure this according to the format is to list assumptions and then the problem. The example included assumptions and a single problem statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the main problem is the general case, with the assumption that n is a natural number. However, the user is particularly interested in n=3 and n>3. But the example didn't include multiple problem statements. Therefore, perhaps the problem part should be the general case, and the specific request is part of the problem. But the example shows that if the original problem is general, the formatted problem can be a specific case with added assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove the value for n=3, with the assumption that n=3, but that's not an assumption. Alternatively, the assumption is that n is a natural number and the problem is to evaluate I_n, with a focus on n=3.\n\nBut I think the correct approach here is to list the assumption as n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate the integral I_n for each n∈ℕ, with specific attention to proving the case for n=3 and determining the feasibility for n>3. However, the format requires the problem to be a single statement. Given the example, which took a general problem and formatted it with a specific assumption (even if incorrect), maybe here the formatted problem should be the general case with the assumption n∈ℕ. But the user's specific request is about n=3. But how to reconcile that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is split into two parts: one general and one specific. But the format doesn't allow that. Therefore, given the example, perhaps the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate the integral I_n for each n∈ℕ. However, the user's specific focus is on n=3, but the problem statement as per the original question is general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem to be the specific case of n=3, with the assumption that n=3. But n=3 is not an assumption, it's a value. So the assumption would still be n∈ℕ.\n\nHmm. Given the complexity, I think the correct approach is to list the assumption as n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate the integral I_n = ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]^n dx for each n∈ℕ. However, the user also specifically asks to prove the case for n=3, but the general problem includes that. Therefore, the problem statement is as originally posed: evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ. The specific cases (n=3, etc.) are part of the problem exploration but not the core problem statement.\n\nBut in the example, the user restructured a general problem into a specific case by adding an assumption. However, that might not be appropriate here unless there's an implicit assumption in the original problem. But in this case, the original problem explicitly states n∈ℕ, so the assumption is n∈ℕ.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the definite integral $$\\mathcal{I}_n := \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^n \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nBut the user is particularly interested in proving the case for n=3 and whether higher n can be evaluated. However, the problem statement as per the original question is to evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ. The specific cases are instances of this general problem.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction had the original problem as general, but the formatted problem was a specific case with added assumptions. That suggests that maybe the user wants to extract a specific sub-problem from the original question. In the current case, the original question includes a specific sub-problem: proving the conjectured value for n=3. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should focus on that specific sub-problem, with the assumption that n=3. However, n=3 is not an assumption but a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the value for n=3, then the assumption could be n=3, but that's redundant. Therefore, perhaps the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n, with a specific request to prove the case for n=3.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is a single statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should encapsulate the main problem, which is evaluating I_n for each natural number n. The specific request for n=3 is part of the problem's context but not the main problem statement. However, the user is asking for a more direct proof for n=3, so perhaps the problem part should be to prove the specific integral for n=3.\n\nGiven the user's specific request: \"Prove: ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]³ dx = ...\", the formatted problem should be that statement, with the assumption that n=3 (but n=3 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption). However, since assumptions are properties or conditions applied to an object, in this case, the object is n, and the assumption is that n is a natural number. But the problem is to evaluate I_3. Therefore, the assumption is n=3 (but technically, n=3 is a value, not an assumption). Alternatively, the assumption is that n is a natural number and the problem is to evaluate I_3. But since the problem is about a specific n, the assumption is redundant. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is general, and the specific case is implied. But given the user's example, where they added an assumption not present in the original problem, I think the correct approach here is to list the assumption as n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n for each n∈ℕ. The specific case for n=3 is part of the problem's context but not the formatted problem. However, the user's instruction example included a specific case with added assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should focus on the specific case (n=3) with the assumption that n is a natural number. But in the example, the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7, which changed the original problem's scope. So perhaps in this case, the formatted problem is to prove the specific integral for n=3, with the assumption that n is a natural number. However, n=3 is a specific instance, so the assumption would still be n∈ℕ. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is about n=3, but the general problem is for any n, perhaps the assumption is omitted, but that's not according to the example.\n\nThis is a bit challenging. Given the user's example, even if it seems incorrect, they included assumptions that weren't in the original problem. Therefore, in this case, perhaps the formatted problem should focus on the specific case the user is asking about (n=3) and list any relevant assumptions. However, the only assumption is that the integral is being taken over [0,1], which is given in the problem statement, and that Li₂(x) is the dilogarithm function. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). So in this case, the assumptions would be about n, but since the problem is specific to n=3, maybe there are no assumptions needed beyond n=3. However, n=3 is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, the assumption is that the dilogarithm function is defined as usual, but that's inherent to the problem. The example didn't list function definitions as assumptions. Therefore, considering all this, the correct formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 6\\zeta(5) + 36\\zeta(3) + \\frac{\\pi^6}{216} + \\frac{19\\pi^4}{60} + 3\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\zeta(3) - 90.$$\n\nAnd also evaluate the definite integral $$\\mathcal{I}_n := \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^n \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$ for natural numbers n > 3.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be a single problem statement. However, the original question has two parts: proving n=3 and evaluating n>3. But the format example had a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be the general case, and the specific proof is part of the problem's details. Alternatively, focus on the specific case the user is asking about.\n\nGiven that the user specifically writes \"Prove: ∫₀¹ [Li₂(x)]³ dx = ...\", the main problem they want formatted is that specific integral. Therefore, the assumption would be that n=3 (but as a value, not an assumption) or that n is a natural number. But n=3 is a specific value. Therefore, the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for n=3, the definite integral $$\\mathcal{I}_3 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$ equals $$6\\zeta(5) + 36\\zeta(3) + \\frac{\\pi^6}{216} + \\frac{19\\pi^4}{60} + 3\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\zeta(3) - 90.$$\n\nAlternatively, since n=3 is part of the problem statement, the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n, with the specific case highlighted. But the example included assumptions that were not explicitly stated, so perhaps here the assumption is n=3, but that's not an assumption. This is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate I_3, and the assumption is that the dilogarithm function is as defined and the integral is over [0,1]. But the example didn't include such assumptions. Since the example only included assumptions about variables in the problem (n), here the assumption is n=3. But n=3 is a specific value, not a condition. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions other than the integral being defined as stated.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem was for all integers, the formatted problem included an assumption about n. Therefore, in this case, the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n, with a focus on n=3. But the example showed that even for a general problem, specific assumptions can be listed. However, in the example, the assumption added a condition not present in the original problem, which might be incorrect. But following that, perhaps here the assumption is n is a natural number, and the problem is to evaluate I_n. The user's specific focus on n=3 is part of the problem's context.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the definite integral $$\\mathcal{I}_n := \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^n \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and provide a direct proof for the case when $n=3$.\n\nBut the example's problem part was a single statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the general problem as the problem statement, and the specific case is part of it. However, the user is specifically asking to prove the n=3 case. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 6\\zeta(5) + 36\\zeta(3) + \\frac{\\pi^6}{216} + \\frac{19\\pi^4}{60} + 3\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\zeta(3) - 90$$ and determine the largest natural number $n$ for which $\\mathcal{I}_n$ can be evaluated.\n\nThis combines both the specific proof and the general inquiry. However, the example had a single problem statement. Given the complexity, I think the user wants the main problem to be the specific case of n=3, with the assumption that n is a natural number. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}x = 6\\zeta(5) + 36\\zeta(3) + \\frac{\\pi^6}{216} + \\frac{19\\pi^4}{60} + 3\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\zeta(3) - 90.$$\n\nAdditionally, determine if the integral can be evaluated for natural numbers $n > 3$.\n\nBut the example didn't have multiple problem statements. Therefore, perhaps the problem part should only include the specific case, and the general case is part of the context. However, the original problem is to evaluate for each n∈ℕ. Given the user's instruction example, which extracted a specific case from a general problem, perhaps here the formatted problem focuses on the specific case (n=3) with the assumption that n is a natural number. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the definite integral $$\\mathcal{I}_3 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \\right]^3 \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$ equals $$6\\zeta(5) + 36\\zeta(3) + \\frac{\\pi^6}{216} + \\frac{19\\pi^4}{60} + 3\\pi^2 - 2\\pi^2 \\zeta(3) - 90.$$\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included a condition not in the original problem. However, here, the assumption is n is a natural number, which is part of the original problem. Therefore, this seems correct.",
