    "Content": "I have a proof and need some feedback. It seems really obvious that the statement is true but it is always the obvious ones that are a little trickier to prove. So I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you! Here is what I am asked to prove: If $n$ is composite then $(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. Proof: $n$ is composite $\\implies n=ab$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $0<a,b<n$. Case 1:\nIf $a=b$ then $n=a^{2}$.\nNow $n \\mid (n-1)! \\implies a \\mid (n-1)!$, so\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1)! &\\equiv 1\\times 2\\times \\dotsb \\times a \\times\\dotsb\\times (n-a)\\times\\dotsb\\times (n-1) \\\\ &\\equiv 1\\times 2\\times \\dotsb\\times a \\times\\dotsb\\times -a\\times\\dotsb\\times -1 \\\\ &\\equiv 0 \\pmod n\n\\end{aligned}$$ Case 2:\n$0<a<b<n$. Then, since $a \\mid n$, $b \\mid n$ and $n \\mid (n-1)!$ we have that $a \\mid (n-1)!$ and $b \\mid (n-1)!$. So this implies\n$(n-1)! \\equiv 1\\times 2\\times \\dotsb\\times a \\times\\dotsb\\times b\\times\\dotsb\\times (n-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$,\nQ.E.D.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to read the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"If $n\\ne 4$ is composite, then $n$ divides $(n-1)!$.\" The question body restates this and includes a proof attempt. The original problem statement is: If $n$ is composite then $(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$. However, the title adds the condition that $n \\neq 4$. So there's an important detail here—the result holds for composite numbers except when n is 4. \n\nNow, looking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem in the example mentions divisibility by 7, but in this case, the problem has two main conditions: n is composite and n is not equal to 4. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n1. $n$ is a composite number.\n2. $n \\neq 4$.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that $n$ divides $(n-1)!$, or equivalently, $(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$.\n\nWait, but the original problem in the question didn't mention $n \\neq 4$ in the statement, but the title did. The user's proof might not have considered that. But according to the title, the correct statement includes $n \\neq 4$. So the formatted problem should include both conditions as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions should list each condition separately. Then the problem is the statement to prove. Let me check if there are any other conditions. The problem is about composite numbers, so n is composite, and n is not 4. Those are two separate assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is a composite number,\n$n \\neq 4$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $(n-1)! \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nThat seems to fit the example structure where each assumption is a single condition on one object. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, two separate conditions on n: composite and not equal to 4. So yes, this should be the correct structure.",
