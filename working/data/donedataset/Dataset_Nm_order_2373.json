    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a hint. You assume that $n!>\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n$. Now you should show it for n+1, i.e., you should show that $(n+1)! > \\left(\\frac{n+1}{e}\\right)^{n+1}$. You can write \\begin{equation}\n(n+1)! > (n+1) \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n = (n+1)\\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^n \\left(\\frac{(n+1)^n}{e^n}\\right)\n\\end{equation} Can you solve it from here?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. The original problem is to prove by induction that n! > (n/e)^n. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided in the instruction listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. \n\nLooking at the problem here, the induction proof typically requires a base case and the inductive step. The base case here would be for a specific integer n, probably n=1. Then the inductive step assumes it's true for some integer k and proves for k+1. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be that n is a positive integer. But wait, the original problem doesn't specify, but induction usually starts at some base. The question title is \"Solve by induction: n! > (n/e)^n\", so the assumption is that n is a positive integer for which the inequality holds. However, in the example given, the assumptions were more about the conditions on n. So for this problem, maybe the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state any restrictions on n, but since factorial is defined for non-negative integers, and the inequality needs to hold, probably n >= 1.\n\nSo the assumptions should list that n is a positive integer. But the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe only one assumption: n is a positive integer. Wait, but the problem is to prove by induction, so perhaps there's a base case assumption. However, in the example, the user structured the problem's assumptions as the given conditions, not the method. The problem is to prove the inequality by induction, so the induction method is part of the solution approach, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions are the conditions on n. The original problem doesn't specify, but since factorial is defined for integers ≥0, and the inequality n! > (n/e)^n. Let's check for n=1: 1! = 1, (1/e)^1 ≈ 0.367, so 1 > 0.367, which holds. For n=0: 0! =1, (0/e)^0 is undefined (since 0^0 is undefined), so n must be at least 1. Hence, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have the assumption that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove by induction that n! > (n/e)^n. \n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original question. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted the assumption as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check again. \n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n doesn't need to be divisible by 7. The user might have made an error there. But the user provided that as their example. So perhaps in their formatting, they included additional constraints that weren't in the original problem? That might be a mistake. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem correctly. The original problem is to prove by induction that n! > (n/e)^n. The user example had the original problem's assumptions split into two lines. So for this problem, the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. But since the induction proof would require starting at some base case, perhaps the assumption is that n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. But the problem statement itself doesn't specify, but mathematically, n! is defined for integers ≥0, and the inequality needs to hold for n ≥1. \n\nSo the formatted assumption here should be \"n is a positive integer\". That's the only assumption needed for the problem. The problem is to prove the inequality by induction. \n\nTherefore, the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer\nProblem: Prove by induction that n! > (n/e)^n.\n\nWait, but the original problem's title is \"Solve by induction: n! > (n/e)^n\". The user in their example included the divisibility condition as an assumption, which might not have been in the original problem. But perhaps the user in their example made a mistake, and the original problem didn't have the \"n divisible by 7\" assumption. \n\nBut following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. So in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not have been in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user in their example extracted assumptions from the problem statement and possibly added necessary ones. Wait, but in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem includes that as an assumption. That seems incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The original problem in the example was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" (which is given in the problem) and \"n is divisible by 7\" (which was not mentioned in the problem). This seems like an error. Perhaps the user intended to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was different. \n\nThis suggests that maybe the example provided by the user has a mistake. However, the current task is to follow the format as per the user's example, even if the example itself is incorrect. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user wants to format the problem \"Solve by induction: n! > (n/e)^n\". The key assumptions here are that n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the inequality by induction. \n\nSo following the example's structure, the assumptions would list the conditions on n. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer\nProblem: Prove by induction that n! > (n/e)^n.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions. Perhaps in this case, since n must be a positive integer, that's the only assumption. Therefore, the answer should list that assumption and the problem statement.",
