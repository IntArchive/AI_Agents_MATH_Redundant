    "AcceptedAnswer": "The definition of a normal group is: A group $H\\leq G$ is a normal subgroup if for any $g\\in G$, the set $gH$ equals the set $Hg$. Equivalently, you can also demand $H=gHg^{-1}$. Now, take a subgroup $H$ of an abelian group $G$. Take any element $x\\in gHg^{-1}$. By definition, this element must equal $ghg^{-1}$ for some $h\\in H$. Now you have $x=ghg^{-1}$, where $g\\in G$ and $h\\in H$. Can you prove $x\\in H$?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, they presented the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the Math Stack Exchange question: \"Prove that every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup.\" So the main goal is to show that in an abelian group, any subgroup is normal.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem is about subgroups of an abelian group. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The group in question is abelian. That's a single property of the group.\n2. We're considering a subgroup of this abelian group. Each subgroup is a subset that itself forms a group under the same operation.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the group is abelian, and the subgroup is a subgroup. So each assumption should be a separate line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The group G is abelian.\n- H is a subgroup of G.\n\nProblem: Prove that H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"every subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup.\" So the problem is general. The assumptions would be that G is abelian, and H is any subgroup of G. Then the problem is to prove H is normal in G.\n\nSo each assumption is one line. The first assumption is G is abelian. The second assumption is H is a subgroup of G. Both apply to different objects (G and H), each with their own conditions.\n\nI should check if there are any other assumptions, but in the problem statement, those are the only two: G is abelian, and H is a subgroup. So the formatted version would have those two assumptions, and the problem is to prove H is normal.",
