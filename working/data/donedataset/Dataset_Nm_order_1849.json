    "Content": "For $n \\geq 3$ let $r(n)$ be the previous prime to $n$ ; i.e., the largest prime strictly less than $n$ . For example, $r(3) = 2$ , $r(10) = 7$ , and so on. I have noticed that $r(n^p)$ is very close to $n^p$ . In fact, I suspect that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power $p$ , where the convergence is faster if $p$ is big. Is this true? Are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence? Is there a simple proof of this fact? Here's an argument that doesn't work: By Bertrand's postulate, there exists a prime between $n^p / 2$ and $n^p$ (roughly). Therefore $$\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} \\geq \\frac{1}{2}.$$ But this is pretty far from $1$ . I think that I can prove this using some fancy number theory results , but they seem like sledgehammers. I'd like something simpler.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice that $r(m)=p_{\\pi(m-1)}$ where $p_m$ is the $m$ th prime number. (Since $m=n^p$ won’t be prime in our case we will always have: $\\pi(m)=\\pi(m-1)$ and we can write everything more conveniently as $r(m)=p_{\\pi(m)}$ .) Look at the number of primes less than $n^p$ : that would be $\\pi(n^p)\\approx\\frac{n^p}{\\log(n^p)}$ . Now you are looking for approximately the $\\pi(n^p)$ th prime number and $p_m\\approx\\,m\\log(m)$ , thus $p_{\\pi(n^p)}\\approx\\,n^p-n^p\\frac{\\log(\\log(n^p))}{\\log(n^p)}$ . Now your function is essentially $p_{\\pi(n^p)}/n^p\\approx{}1-\\frac{\\log(\\log(n^p))}{\\log(n^p)}$ which converges to $1$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about primes being arbitrarily close to powers of integers. Specifically, they define r(n) as the largest prime strictly less than n, and they suspect that as n approaches infinity, the ratio r(n^p)/n^p approaches 1 for any positive integer p. They also mention that the convergence is faster if p is large. They want to know if this is true, effective bounds on the rate, and if there's a simple proof.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. Let's see:\n\n1. The function r(n) is defined as the previous prime to n, i.e., the largest prime strictly less than n. So that's one assumption about the definition of r(n).\n2. The problem considers n ≥ 3. Wait, the original problem says \"For n ≥ 3 let r(n) be the previous prime to n\". So n here is the input to r(n), but in the limit, the user is taking n approaching infinity for n^p. Wait, there might be confusion here. The question is about the limit as n approaches infinity of r(n^p)/n^p. The variable p is a positive integer power. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- n tends to infinity (since the limit is n→∞).\n- r(n^p) is the largest prime strictly less than n^p.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user defines r(n) for n ≥ 3, but when considering r(n^p), n could be starting from some value where n^p ≥ 3. However, since the limit is as n approaches infinity, maybe the specific lower bound for n isn't crucial here. The key assumptions are:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥ some minimum (like n ≥ 2, since n^p must be ≥3 for r(n^p) to exist), but since the limit is for n→∞, perhaps the starting point isn't part of the problem's formal assumptions.\n\nBut in the original problem, they specify \"For n ≥ 3 let r(n) be the previous prime to n\". So maybe the assumption is that n ≥ 3, but in the context of the limit, n is going to infinity, so the condition n ≥3 is automatically satisfied for large n. However, the problem's focus is on the behavior as n→∞. The user is asking about the limit of r(n^p)/n^p as n→∞.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, r(n) is the largest prime strictly less than n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example given by the user had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the original problem says \"For n ≥3 let r(n) be...\", which is part of the problem setup. So the assumptions here should include that r(n^p) is the largest prime less than n^p, and p is a positive integer. The problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity of the ratio r(n^p)/n^p.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, r(n) is the largest prime strictly less than n.\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p, and determine effective bounds on the rate of convergence.\n\nBut wait, the user also asks if there's a simple proof and if it's true. So the problem is to prove the limit, address effective bounds, and whether a simple proof exists.\n\nBut according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be a concise statement. The original example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, the problem would be the main question: proving the limit is 1, and perhaps the other parts about effective bounds and simple proof. However, in the user's example, they only included the main problem statement, not the additional questions. Wait, looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem included only the main problem. So perhaps here, the main problem is proving the limit equals 1. The other parts (effective bounds, simple proof) are sub-questions but might need to be included in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Problem should encapsulate all the questions asked. The user wrote:\n\n\"Is this true? Are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence? Is there a simple proof of this fact?\"\n\nBut the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". So maybe the problem should include all three questions. However, the example given only took the main problem (prove A(n) is divisible by 91) even though the original problem had more text. The user's example filtered out the extra info and structured it. So here, the main problem is to prove the limit is 1, with possible sub-questions about bounds and proof simplicity. But according to the example, perhaps the formatted problem should be just the main question, and the other parts are considered additional but maybe not part of the structured problem. However, the user's original question includes all three parts. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Problem part should include all the questions posed. So:\n\nProblem: Is it true that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p? Are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence? Is there a simple proof of this fact?\n\nBut the example's problem was a statement to prove, not a question. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", and the example used a statement to prove. However, the original problem here is phrased as questions. So perhaps the Problem should be the main conjecture, i.e., the limit equals 1, and the other parts (effective bounds, simple proof) are part of the problem's requirements.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example took the main proposition to prove, even if the original problem had more text, maybe here the main problem is the limit statement, and the other questions are secondary. But the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem as the following format\", which in the example included the main problem to prove. So perhaps here:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p. Determine effective bounds on the rate of convergence and provide a simple proof.\n\nBut I need to check the original question's exact wording. The original question says:\n\n\"I suspect that [limit] =1 for any positive integer power p, where the convergence is faster if p is big. Is this true? Are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence? Is there a simple proof of this fact?\"\n\nSo the problem has three parts: whether the limit is true, bounds on convergence rate, and a simple proof. However, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem only includes the main statement to prove. The user's example had the original problem asking to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem was just that statement. So perhaps here, the main problem is the limit statement, and the other parts (bounds, proof) are additional questions. But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\", which in the example is a single statement. So maybe here, the problem should be the main conjecture, i.e., the limit equals 1, and the other questions are part of the problem but need to be included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Problem section should encapsulate all the questions asked. Since the user's original problem includes multiple questions, the formatted problem should include all of them. But the example only had one problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists two assumptions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. However, in that case, the original problem didn't have multiple questions but a single statement. Here, the original problem has multiple questions: \"Is this true? Are there effective bounds...? Is there a simple proof...?\"\n\nSo perhaps the formatted problem should include all three questions as part of the problem statement.\n\nBut the example shows that the formatted problem only includes the main assertion to prove. Therefore, maybe the user wants to extract the main mathematical statement to prove, which is the limit, and the other questions are considered additional but not part of the structured problem. Alternatively, perhaps they should be included.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" The example filtered out the original problem's extra text (like the example numbers, etc.) and presented the core problem.\n\nIn the current case, the core problem is the user's suspicion that the limit is 1, and they are asking three things: is it true, bounds on convergence, and a simple proof. So maybe the Problem part should be the conjecture (the limit equals 1), and the other parts are implicitly part of the problem. Alternatively, the Problem should include all three questions. Since the example only had the main problem, perhaps here too, the main problem is to prove the limit, and the other questions are considered part of the problem but need to be included in the Problem section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Problem should be as the user wrote: \"Is this true? Are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence? Is there a simple proof of this fact?\" But the example's Problem was a statement to prove, not questions. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's instruction: \"structure that problem as the following format\". The example's Problem is a statement to prove. So perhaps here, even though the original problem is phrased as questions, the Problem should be the mathematical assertion to prove, i.e., the limit equals 1. The other questions (effective bounds, simple proof) can be considered part of the problem but might need to be mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to include all parts. Given that the example didn't include additional questions, perhaps here the main problem is the limit statement, and the other parts are considered part of the problem's requirements. So the Problem would be: \"Prove that [limit] =1 for any positive integer p, determine effective bounds on the rate of convergence, and provide a simple proof.\"\n\nBut I need to adhere to the user's example. In the example, the original problem was a single statement to prove, and the formatted problem was that statement with assumptions. Here, the original problem is a question with multiple parts. The user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\". The unrelated information here might be the example numbers (r(3)=2, r(10)=7), the mention of Bertrand's postulate and the failed argument, and the reference to using sledgehammers. The core problem is the conjecture about the limit, the request for bounds, and a simple proof.\n\nSo, combining all, the Problem part should include all three questions, but structured concisely. However, the example shows that the problem is a single statement. Maybe the user expects the main mathematical claim to be the Problem, and the rest are implicit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Problem should be as follows:\n\nProblem: Is it true that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p? Additionally, are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence, and can this be proven simply?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\". So maybe the user wants to convert the questions into a statement to prove. Since the original problem's main suspicion is the limit, perhaps the Problem is to prove that the limit equals 1, and the other parts (bounds, simple proof) are additional aspects of the same problem.\n\nIn academic terms, when someone says \"Is this true? Can we find bounds? Is there a simple proof?\", the core problem is to establish the truth of the statement (prove the limit), and then address the related questions of bounds and proof simplicity. But according to the example, the Problem is just the main statement to prove. So perhaps here, the Problem is to prove the limit, and the other parts are considered additional but not part of the structured problem. However, the user might want them included.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the example where the Problem was a single statement to prove despite the original problem having more text (the example's original problem mentioned the user's attempt with Bertrand's postulate but the formatted problem omitted that), perhaps here the formatted problem should be the main conjecture as a statement to prove, and the other questions are omitted as \"unrelated information\". Alternatively, the effective bounds and simple proof are part of the problem.\n\nWait, the user's original problem in the example had a mistake in the assumptions. The original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, no: the original example's formatted problem has assumptions \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So that seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to replicate their format.\n\nIn any case, focusing on the current problem:\n\nThe assumptions should list each condition. The problem is about r(n^p)/n^p approaching 1 as n→∞ for any positive integer p. The assumptions would be:\n\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥3, r(n) is the largest prime strictly less than n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nThe problem is to prove the limit equals 1, find effective bounds, and provide a simple proof. But following the example, maybe only the main conjecture is included in the Problem.\n\nThus, after filtering, the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥3, r(n) is the largest prime strictly less than n.\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p.\n\nBut the original question also mentions \"where the convergence is faster if p is big\". However, that might be part of the conjecture, so perhaps it should be included. But in the Problem section, it's part of the user's suspicion. The example didn't include such qualifiers. So maybe it's considered additional info and filtered out.\n\nAlternatively, include it as part of the problem statement. But to adhere to the example's style, which extracted the core mathematical statement, I think the Problem should be the main limit expression, and the rest about convergence speed and effective bounds are separate questions but part of the original problem. However, the user's format example didn't include multiple questions, so perhaps here the Problem includes all parts.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to \"filter the unrelated information\". The unrelated information here might be the examples of r(3)=2, r(10)=7, the mention of Bertrand's postulate and the failed argument, and the reference to \"fancy number theory results\". The core mathematical problem is the limit, the bounds, and the proof simplicity.\n\nHowever, the Problem section in the example was a single statement. Given that, perhaps the main Problem is the limit, and the other parts are additional questions. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", which includes Assumption and Problem. So if the original problem has multiple questions, perhaps they should all be in the Problem section.\n\nThus, the final structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a positive integer.\n- For each integer n ≥3, r(n) is the largest prime strictly less than n.\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem:\nIs it true that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p? Additionally, are there effective bounds on the rate of convergence, and can this be proven with a simple proof?\n\nBut the example used \"Prove that...\" even though the original problem might have been posed as a question. So perhaps the Problem should be phrased as a statement to prove, incorporating the user's suspicion. The user says \"I suspect that [limit] =1... Is this true? ...\". So the Problem is to prove or disprove the conjecture.\n\nThus:\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{r(n^p)}{n^p} = 1$$ for any positive integer power p. Determine effective bounds on the rate of convergence and provide a simple proof if possible.\n\nBut the example's Problem was a direct \"Prove that...\". Given that the user suspects it's true, maybe the Problem is to prove it.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all this, the formatted problem should have the assumptions about p being a positive integer, the definition of r(n), and the limit as n approaches infinity. The Problem is to prove the limit equals 1, with the additional aspects of bounds and simplicity of proof included as part of the problem statement.",
