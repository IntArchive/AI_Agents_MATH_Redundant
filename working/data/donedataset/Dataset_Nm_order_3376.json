    "Content": "I am fighting with this proof-writing problem for a while. The statement says $$|a+b|+|a-b| \\geq |a|+|b|.$$ I know the triangle inequality which says$$|a+b| \\leq |a|+|b|.$$ How can I use this inequality to prove the statement above? I am adding the distance between $a$ and $b$ to $|a+b|$ which then turns the triangle inequality to another direction. How can I prove this in a mathematical way?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$2|a|=|a+b+a-b|\\leq |a+b|+|a-b|$ $2|b|=|b+a+b-a|\\leq |b+a|+|b-a|=|a+b|+|a-b|$ Add these inequalities and then halve.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the assumptions and the problem statement. So first, I need to read the Math Stack Exchange question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Prove |a+b| + |a−b| ≥ |a| + |b|\". The question mentions using the triangle inequality (which is |a+b| ≤ |a| + |b|) to prove the given statement. The user is confused about how to turn that into the opposite direction by adding the distance between a and b.\n\nNow, following the example, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. The original problem here is about real numbers a and b, right? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on a and b, so the assumptions would probably just be that a and b are real numbers. The triangle inequality applies to any real numbers, so the key here is that there are no additional constraints like divisibility or specific values. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this current problem, there's no such restriction mentioned. The user is just asking to prove the inequality for any a and b. So maybe the only assumption is that a and b are real numbers? But the example included even if the problem didn't explicitly state it. Wait, the original problem in the example had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption listed n is an integer. Then, perhaps here, since the problem is about real numbers a and b, the assumption should list that a and b are real numbers. But in the original question, the user didn't mention any restrictions. Wait, the problem statement is just \"Prove |a+b| + |a−b| ≥ |a| + |b|\". In real analysis, absolute values are typically for real numbers, but maybe complex numbers? But the triangle inequality as stated is for real numbers. The user mentioned the triangle inequality as |a+b| ≤ |a| + |b|, which is for real numbers. So probably, the assumption here is that a and b are real numbers. But since the original problem didn't specify, should we include that? The example included n as an integer even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So following that, if the problem is about real numbers a and b, then the assumption should state that a and b are real numbers. But the problem as written doesn't specify; it just says \"prove this inequality\". However, in mathematical contexts, unless specified otherwise, variables are assumed to be real numbers. But maybe in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" because the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Similarly, here, since the problem is about absolute values without specifying, perhaps the assumption is a and b are real numbers. However, in the problem statement given by the user, they don't mention complex numbers. So I think the correct assumptions here would be that a and b are real numbers. Each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nb is a real number.\n\nThen the problem is to prove |a+b| + |a−b| ≥ |a| + |b|.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then in the formatted problem, the user included that as an assumption. Here, the problem doesn't specify, but since absolute value is defined for real numbers (and complex, but the triangle inequality in the question is for real), so likely, the assumptions are a and b are real numbers. So that's two assumptions. Each on their own line.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na is a real number,\nb is a real number.\nProblem: Prove that $$|a+b| + |a - b| \\geq |a| + |b|.$$\n###\n\nI think that's correct. The problem didn't state any other conditions, so the assumptions are just that a and b are real numbers. Each is listed separately. The problem is to prove the inequality. The original question mentioned using the triangle inequality, but that's part of the problem-solving process, not an assumption. So the assumptions are just the domain of a and b.",
