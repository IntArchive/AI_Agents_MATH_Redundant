    "Content": "I found the following result (I apologize if this has been posted before, but I could not find anything here).  I am wondering whether there is an approach without using contour integration. Let $k$ be a nonnegative real number.  Prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\Big(1-\\exp(-k)\\Big)=\\pi\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k}{2}\\right)\\,\\sinh\\left(\\frac{k}{2}\\right)\\,.$$ I am especially interested in a solution not using complex analysis.  However, a complex-analytic solution that is different from mine is very welcome as well.  I have three approaches, but all of them end up using complex analysis as a major part. We also have this very nice consequence.  This result can be proven on its own without knowing the integral $\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x$. Let $k$ be a nonnegative real number.  Then,\n  $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{1-\\cos(kx)}{x^2\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\big(k-1+\\exp(-k)\\big)\\,.$$\n  Equivalently,\n  $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin^2(kx)}{x^2\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\,\\big(2k-1+\\exp(-2k)\\big)\\,.$$ Interestingly, during my quest to obtain this integral, I discovered two more integral relations, although I do not know how to obtain the exact values of any of them.  The exact values of these integrals involve the exponential integral $\\text{Ei}$, where $\\text{Ei}(x)=\\displaystyle\\text{PV}\\int_{-\\infty}^x\\,\\frac{\\exp(t)}{t}\\,\\text{d}t$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.  Both of the results below also came from contour integrations. Let $k$ be a nonnegative real number.  Then,\n  $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{1-\\cos(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x=-\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\,\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\ln(x)\\,\\sin(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x\\,.$$\n  and\n  $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x=-\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\,\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\ln(x)\\,\\cos(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x\\,.$$ Mathematica says that \n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{\\exp(-k)\\,\\text{Ei}(+k)-\\exp(+k)\\,\\text{Ei}(-k)}{2}$$\nand that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{1-\\cos(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x=\\gamma+\\ln(k)-\\frac{\\exp(-k)\\,\\text{Ei}(+k)+\\exp(+k)\\,\\text{Ei}(-k)}{2}\\,.$$\nHere, $\\gamma\\approx 0.57722$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant . Approach I. Consider the meromorphic function $f(z):=\\dfrac{\\exp(\\text{i}kz)}{z(z^2+1)}$ for all $z\\in \\mathbb{C}\\setminus \\{0,-\\text{i},+\\text{i}\\}$.  For $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$, let $C_\\epsilon$ be the positively oriented contour $$\\left[+\\epsilon,+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right]\\cup \\Biggl\\{\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)}{\\epsilon}\\,\\Bigg|\\,\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]\\Biggr\\}\\cup\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon},-\\epsilon\\right]\\cup \\Big\\{\\epsilon\\,\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)\\,\\Big|\\,\\theta\\in[\\pi,0]\\Big\\}\\,.$$  Write $\\Gamma_r$ for the positively-oriented (with respect to $0$) semicircle $\\Big\\{r\\,\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)\\,\\Big|\\,\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]\\Big\\}$ for every $r>0$.  We have $$I(k):=\\lim\\limits_{\\epsilon\\to 0^+}\\,\\oint_{C_\\epsilon}\\,f(z)\\,\\text{d}z=2\\pi\\text{i}\\,\\text{Res}_{z=\\text{i}}\\big(f(z)\\big)=-\\pi\\text{i}\\,\\exp(-k)\\,.$$  Now, note that $$\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+}\\,\\int_{\\Gamma_\\epsilon}\\,f(z)\\,\\text{d}z=\\pi\\text{i}\\text{ and }\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+}\\,\\int_{\\Gamma_{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}}\\,f(z)\\,\\text{d}z=0\\,.$$  Because $$I(k)=\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\exp(+\\text{i}kx)-\\exp(-\\text{i}kx)}{x(x^2+1)}\\,\\text{d}x-\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+}\\,\\int_{\\Gamma_\\epsilon}\\,f(z)\\,\\text{d}z+\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+}\\,\\int_{\\Gamma_{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}}\\,f(z)\\,\\text{d}z\\,,$$ we see that $$I(k)=2\\text{i}\\,\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x(x^2+1)}\\,\\text{d}x-\\pi\\text{i}\\,.$$ The result follows immediately. Approach II. We apply Richard Feynman's integral trick.  First, define $J(k)$ to be the required integral: $$J(k):=\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x(x^2+1)}\\,\\text{d}x\\,.$$  Thus, by the Leibniz Integral Rule, we have $J'(k)=\\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\cos(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x$.   Let $g(z):=\\dfrac{\\exp(\\text{i}kz)}{z^2+1}$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{-\\text{i},+\\text{i}\\}$.  It follows that $$\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^+}\\,\\oint_{C_\\epsilon}\\,g(z)\\,\\text{d}z=2\\,\\int_{0}^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\cos(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x\\,,$$ where $C_\\epsilon$ is the positively oriented contour $$\\left[+\\epsilon,+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right]\\cup \\Biggl\\{\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)}{\\epsilon}\\,\\Bigg|\\,\\theta\\in[0,\\pi]\\Biggr\\}\\cup\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon},-\\epsilon\\right]\\cup \\Big\\{\\epsilon\\,\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)\\,\\Big|\\,\\theta\\in[\\pi,0]\\Big\\}\\text{ for }\\epsilon\\in(0,1)\\,.$$   Furthermore, we have $$\\oint_{C_\\epsilon}\\,g(z)\\,\\text{d}z=2\\pi\\text{i}\\,\\text{Res}_{z=\\text{i}}\\big(g(z)\\big)=\\pi\\,\\exp(-k)\\text{ for all }\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$$   Ergo, $J'(k)=\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\cos(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x=\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\exp(-k)$.  Since $J(0)=0$, $$J(k)=\\int_0^k\\,J'(t)\\,\\text{d}t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\int_0^k\\,\\exp(-t)\\,\\text{d}t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\big(1-\\exp(-k)\\big)\\,.$$ Approach III. It is easy to see that $\\dfrac{\\sin(t)}{t}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_{-1}^{+1}\\,\\exp(\\text{i}t\\tau)\\,\\text{d}\\tau$ for all $t\\neq 0$.  That is, the required integral is given by $$\\begin{align}J(k):=\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x\\,\\left(x^2+1\\right)}\\,\\text{d}x&=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_{0}^\\infty\\,\\frac{k}{x^2+1}\\,\\int_{-1}^{+1}\\,\\exp(\\text{i}kxt)\\,\\text{d}t\\,\\text{d}x\\\\&=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\,\\frac{k}{x^2+1}\\,\\int_{0}^{1}\\,\\exp(\\text{i}kxt)\\,\\text{d}t\\,\\text{d}x\\,.\\end{align}$$  Using Fubini's Theorem, we obtain $$J(k)=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_0^1\\,k\\,\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\,\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}kxt)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x\\,\\text{d}t\\,.$$ For a real number $R>1$, let $\\gamma_R$ be the positively oriented contour $$[-R,+R]\\cup\\big\\{R\\,\\exp(\\text{i}\\theta)\\,\\big|\\,\\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]\\big\\}\\,.$$  Then, for $\\omega \\geq 0$, we have $$\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\,\\oint_{\\gamma_R}\\,\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}\\omega z)}{z^2+1}\\,\\text{d}z=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\,\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}\\omega x)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x=:K(\\omega)\\,.$$  Ergo, $$K(\\omega)=2\\pi\\text{i}\\,\\text{Res}_{z=\\text{i}}\\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\text{i}\\omega z)}{z^2+1}\\right)=2\\pi\\text{i}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\omega)}{2\\text{i}}\\right)=\\pi\\,\\exp(-\\omega)\\,.$$ As $\\displaystyle J(k)=\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int_0^1\\,k\\,K(kt)\\,\\text{d}t$, we conclude that $$J(k)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\int_0^1\\,k\\,\\exp(-kt)\\,\\text{d}t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\big(1-\\exp(-k)\\big)\\,.$$  From this proof, we also obtain $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\cos(kx)}{x^2+1}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{1}{2}\\,K(k)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\exp(-k)\\,.$$ P.S. I put my solutions in spoilers for people who want to try to solve the problem without being led on by my attempts.  If you do not want to waste your time doing what I have already done, then please look at the spoilers.  All of the solutions in the spoilers are complex-analytic proofs anyhow, so if you are giving me a real-analytic proof, then there is no way you are going to replicate my work.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original problem carefully and identify the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that the integral of sin(kx)/(x(x²+1)) from 0 to infinity equals (π/2)(1 - exp(-k)) for all non-negative real numbers k. The user mentions they want a solution without complex analysis, but they also provided their own approaches using contour integration and other methods.\n\nNow, to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The main problem here is the integral equality. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are about the variables involved. In this case, the integral is for all non-negative real numbers k. So the key assumption is that k is a non-negative real number. There might be other implicit assumptions, like the integral converges, but the problem likely assumes standard conditions for convergence here. However, the user explicitly states \"for all k in ℝ≥0\", so that's the main assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: k is a nonnegative real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀^∞ [sin(kx)/(x(x²+1))] dx = (π/2)(1 - exp(-k)).\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any extra information from the question, like the alternative forms or the other integrals mentioned. The user's main problem is the first integral they stated. The rest of the content, like their approaches and other integrals, are additional details but not part of the core problem they want formatted. So filtering those out is important.\n\nLet me double-check the original question. The title is the integral equality, and the first part of the question restates it. The rest discusses approaches and related integrals, which are not needed for the formatted problem. The key elements are the integral expression and the condition on k. So yes, the assumptions are only about k being non-negative real, and the problem is to prove that integral equals the given expression.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a nonnegative real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\,\\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x(x^2+1)}\\,\\text{d}x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,\\left(1-\\exp(-k)\\right)$$.",
