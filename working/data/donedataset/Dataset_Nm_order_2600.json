    "Content": "I know this has been asked before, in a bunch of places, so I expect it to be closed as a duplicate at some point, but I'd like to know if my own proof works. If the proof is incorrect, please limit answers to pointing out the errors. If the proof is correct, then thoughts on improving it would be appreciated. Prove that $\\Bbb Q$ is not the direct product of two non-trivial groups. —Aluffi exercise II.3.5. My proof Suppose that $\\Bbb Q = G \\times H$ , neither $G$ nor $H$ trivial. First note that $0_G$ is the only element of $G$ with finite order: If $m\\ne 0$ and $m\\cdot g=0_G$ , then $m\\cdot(g,0_H)=0_{G\\times H}$ , contradicting the fact that $\\Bbb Q$ has no non-zero elements of finite order. Suppose that for some $m\\ne 0$ and some $n\\ne 0$ , $\\pi_G(m/n)=0_G$ . Then $0_G=n\\cdot\\pi_G\\left(\\frac m n\\right)=\\pi_G\\left(n\\cdot\\frac m n\\right)=\\pi_G(m)=m\\cdot\\pi_G(1)$ . Since $\\pi_G(1)$ has finite order, we conclude that $\\pi_G(1)=0$ . Since $\\Bbb Z=\\langle 1\\rangle$ , $\\pi_G$ maps every integer to $0_G$ . Now let $a$ and $b$ be non-zero integers. Then $b\\cdot\\pi_G\\left(\\frac a b\\right)=\\pi_G\\left(b\\cdot \\frac a b\\right)=\\pi_G(a)=0_G$ . As above, this shows that $\\pi_G\\left(\\frac a b\\right)=0_G$ . Thus if $\\pi_G$ is not an injective function, then it must map everything to $0_G$ , so $G$ will be a trivial group. The same result holds for $\\pi_H$ . Since by assumption, $G$ and $H$ are non-trivial, $\\pi_G$ and $\\pi_H$ are both injective functions, which is of course impossible.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, your proof is correct. You can avoid proof by contradiction though (which IMO is a good thing to do): write $\\mathbb{Q} = G \\times H$. WLOG $G$ is nontrivial. Then your argument shows that $\\pi_G$ is injective, but its kernel is $0 \\times H$, therefore $H$ is trivial. QED. Is there a specific part of your proof that made you doubt whether it was correct?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the task is to prove that the rational numbers ℚ are not the direct product of two non-trivial groups. The user provided their own proof and wants to check if it's correct. Let me first understand the problem and then go through their proof step by step.\n\nFirst, assumptions. The problem states that ℚ is not a direct product of two non-trivial groups. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. Suppose, for contradiction, that ℚ = G × H where G and H are groups.\n2. Both G and H are non-trivial (i.e., neither is just the trivial group with one element).\n3. The group operation is addition, since ℚ under addition is a group, and direct products of groups typically use the component-wise operation. So we're dealing with abelian groups here because addition in ℚ is commutative.\n\nNow, the user's proof starts by noting that in G, the only element with finite order is 0_G. That makes sense because ℚ has no non-zero elements of finite order (since if you take any non-zero rational number and multiply it by an integer, you can't get zero unless the integer is zero). So if there were a non-zero element in G with finite order, say m·g = 0_G for m ≠ 0, then (g, 0_H) in G × H would have order m, which contradicts ℚ being torsion-free. That part seems correct.\n\nNext, they suppose that for some m/n (non-zero), the projection π_G(m/n) = 0_G. Then they manipulate this to show that π_G(1) must have finite order. Since ℚ is torsion-free, this would force π_G(1) = 0. Then, since every integer is a multiple of 1, π_G maps all integers to 0_G. Then, for any a/b in ℚ, they show that b·π_G(a/b) = 0_G, implying π_G(a/b) has finite order, hence must be 0_G. Therefore, if π_G is not injective, it's the zero map, making G trivial. Since G is supposed to be non-trivial, π_G must be injective. Same for π_H. But if both projections are injective, then the product map would have to be injective as well, which can't happen because ℚ is not isomorphic to a product of two non-trivial groups. Wait, maybe that's not the exact contradiction. Let me think.\n\nIf π_G and π_H are both injective homomorphisms from ℚ to G and H respectively, then the direct product map from ℚ to G × H would be injective. But since we assumed ℚ is equal to G × H, that would imply that the map is an isomorphism. However, ℚ is indecomposable, meaning it can't be written as a direct product of two non-trivial groups. But how exactly does the injectivity lead to a contradiction here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that if both projections are injective, then G and H would both have to contain copies of ℚ, but when you take their direct product, you'd get something larger, not ℚ itself. Wait, ℚ is a divisible abelian group, and in the theory of divisible abelian groups, ℚ is indecomposable. But maybe the user's approach is different.\n\nLooking back at the user's proof: They argue that if G and H are non-trivial, then π_G and π_H must both be injective. But in a direct product decomposition, the projections would be surjective, not necessarily injective. Wait, in the direct product G × H, the projection maps π_G: G × H → G and π_H: G × H → H are surjective homomorphisms. But in this case, the user is considering ℚ as G × H, so they have projection maps from ℚ to G and to H. Since ℚ is being identified with G × H, the projections would indeed be homomorphisms from ℚ to G and to H. The user is assuming that G and H are non-trivial, so they need to show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the key point is that if the projections π_G and π_H are both injective, then ℚ would embed into both G and H. But since ℚ is a divisible group, any non-trivial homomorphic image of ℚ must also be divisible. So if G and H are non-trivial, and π_G and π_H are surjective (as projections in a direct product), then G and H must be divisible. However, the user is arguing that the projections are injective. That part might be where the error is. Let me check.\n\nWait, in a direct product decomposition G × H, the projections are surjective, but not necessarily injective. However, in the user's proof, they seem to be arguing that if the projection π_G has a non-trivial kernel, then G must be trivial. Because if there's some element m/n such that π_G(m/n) = 0_G, then by the user's argument, this would force π_G to map everything to 0_G, making G trivial. Hence, the kernel of π_G must be trivial, so π_G is injective. Similarly for π_H. But in a direct product decomposition, the kernel of π_G would be H (since in G × H, elements of H are in the kernel of π_G). But if ℚ = G × H, then H would have to be a subgroup of ℚ. But the user is treating G and H as subgroups such that ℚ is their direct product. Wait, maybe there's confusion here between internal and external direct products.\n\nIn an internal direct product, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of two subgroups that are both normal and intersect trivially. But ℚ is abelian, so all subgroups are normal. So if ℚ were an internal direct product of G and H, then G and H would be subgroups with G ∩ H = {0} and G + H = ℚ. But the user is talking about an external direct product, i.e., ℚ being isomorphic to G × H as groups. However, even in that case, the projections would be homomorphisms from ℚ to G and H. The issue here is that if the projections are injective, then G and H would both be isomorphic to ℚ, but the direct product of two copies of ℚ is not isomorphic to ℚ itself, since it's not cyclic and has higher rank. Alternatively, maybe the user's contradiction comes from the fact that if both projections are injective, then the images of π_G and π_H would be copies of ℚ in G and H, but then G × H would have elements of the form (q, q') where q and q' are in the images, which would require G and H to be isomorphic to ℚ, leading to a contradiction because ℚ × ℚ is not isomorphic to ℚ.\n\nBut maybe the user's contradiction is simpler: If π_G and π_H are both injective, then the map from ℚ to G × H would be injective (but since we're assuming ℚ is G × H, this would mean that the identity map is injective, which it is). However, the problem is that in a direct product, the projections must be surjective. So if π_G: ℚ → G is both injective and surjective, then it's an isomorphism, same for π_H. Hence, ℚ would be isomorphic to G and to H, so ℚ ≅ ℚ × ℚ, which is impossible because, for example, ℚ is not isomorphic to its own square. That's a standard result in group theory: ℚ is indecomposable. Therefore, the user's conclusion that having both projections injective is impossible is correct, leading to the contradiction.\n\nNow, checking the user's steps:\n\n1. They start by assuming ℚ = G × H with G, H non-trivial.\n2. They note that G and H must be torsion-free because ℚ is torsion-free.\n3. Suppose there's a non-zero element in G with finite order, which leads to a contradiction because ℚ has no torsion. Hence, G and H are torsion-free.\n4. Then they consider π_G(m/n) = 0_G for some m/n ≠ 0. Then through a series of steps, they show that π_G(1) must be 0, hence π_G maps all integers to 0_G.\n5. Then for any a/b in ℚ, they show that π_G(a/b) must be 0_G, implying that G is trivial unless π_G is injective. Since G is non-trivial, π_G must be injective. Same for π_H.\n6. Hence, both projections are injective, which is impossible because you can't have ℚ embedded as a subgroup into two groups whose product is ℚ itself.\n\nThis seems correct. The key step is showing that if the projection π_G has a non-trivial kernel, then G must be trivial. Therefore, since G is non-trivial, π_G must be injective. But in a direct product, the projections are supposed to be surjective, not necessarily injective. However, in this case, because ℚ is being considered as the direct product, the projections are both surjective (since G and H are factors) and injective (as shown by the user's argument). Hence, G and H would both be isomorphic to ℚ, leading to ℚ ≅ ℚ × ℚ, which is impossible. Therefore, the original assumption is wrong, so ℚ cannot be such a direct product.\n\nI think the user's proof is correct. The steps follow logically, and the contradiction arises appropriately. The only thing to maybe clarify is why having both projections injective leads to a contradiction. As I mentioned, it's because that would imply ℚ is isomorphic to its own square, which isn't true. The user might have considered that obvious, but perhaps it's worth mentioning explicitly. However, within the proof's context, the conclusion that it's \"impossible\" is acceptable.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the given format, the assumptions are that ℚ is the direct product of two non-trivial groups G and H. The problem is to prove that this is not possible.\n\nThe user's original problem statement was: \"Prove that $\\Bbb Q$ is not the direct product of two non-trivial groups.\" The assumptions here are that G and H are non-trivial groups, and that ℚ = G × H. So each assumption should be listed line by line.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumption was listing conditions on n. Here, the main assumption is the existence of such a decomposition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\Bbb Q$ is a direct product of groups $G$ and $H$,\n$G$ is a non-trivial group,\n$H$ is a non-trivial group.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\Bbb Q$ cannot be the direct product of two non-trivial groups.\n\nBut the user's original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as in the example; the example's assumption included an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the current problem, the main assumption is that such a decomposition exists. So following the example's structure, we need to list each assumption as separate lines. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample formatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, two assumptions: n is integer, and n divisible by 7. For the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $\\Bbb Q$ is the direct product of groups $G$ and $H$,\n- $G$ is non-trivial,\n- $H$ is non-trivial.\n\nThen the problem is to derive a contradiction, i.e., prove that this is impossible.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formatted problem should have those three assumptions, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
