    "Content": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, $X$ compact, $f : X \\to Y$ continuous. Then the preimage of each compact subset of $Y$ is compact. With the stipulation that $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces, this is a theorem in Pugh's Real Mathematical Analysis . The proof uses sequential compactness. Is this theorem true in general ( i.e. can it be proved with covering compactness alone)?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The claim is true if $Y$ is Hausdorff: if $C\\subseteq Y$ is compact, then it is closed; therefore $f^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $X,$ hence compact. For a counterexample, take $Y=X$ with the indiscrete topology and $f$ the identity map. Then every subset of $Y$ is compact, which can be easily arranged for $X$ not to.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user is asking about whether a theorem regarding the preimage of a compact set under a continuous function holds in general topological spaces, not just metric spaces. The theorem states that if X is compact and f: X → Y is continuous, then the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact. The example provided in the answer uses sequential compactness, which is specific to metric spaces. The question is whether this can be proven using covering compactness (which is the more general form) without relying on metric-specific properties.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. X and Y are topological spaces.\n2. X is compact.\n3. f: X → Y is continuous.\n4. Considering the preimage of a compact subset of Y.\n\nThe problem is to determine if under these conditions, the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact, using covering compactness instead of sequential.\n\nWait, the original theorem in the question is presented as a statement, but the user is questioning its validity in general topological spaces. The title is \"Inverse image of a compact set is compact,\" but the actual question is whether this theorem is true in general, not just in metric spaces. So the problem here is to verify if the theorem holds in general, using covering compactness.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the theorem: X compact, f continuous, Y a topological space, and considering a compact subset of Y. Then the problem is to prove that the preimage is compact under these assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement in the question is phrased as a claim: \"the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact,\" but the user is questioning if this is true in general. So the problem is actually asking whether this statement is true, given that X is compact, f is continuous, and Y is a topological space. So the user wants to know if this theorem can be proven without using sequential compactness (i.e., in general topological spaces using covering compactness).\n\nTherefore, structuring the assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- X is compact.\n- f: X → Y is continuous.\n- K is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that the preimage f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut wait, the original question's title says \"Inverse image of a compact set is compact,\" which would be the statement to prove, given the assumptions. The user is asking whether this theorem is true in general, not just in metric spaces where sequential compactness applies. So the problem is whether, under the assumptions that X is compact, f is continuous, and K is a compact subset of Y, does f⁻¹(K) have to be compact?\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are the conditions given in the theorem. So the formatted problem should list all the assumptions from the theorem, each as a separate line.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. X is a topological space.\n2. Y is a topological space.\n3. X is compact.\n4. f: X → Y is a continuous function.\n5. K is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that the preimage f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the question is actually phrased as a statement that the user is questioning. The question is whether this theorem is true in general, so the problem is to determine if the statement \"the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact\" holds under the given assumptions. Therefore, the problem is to prove or disprove that f⁻¹(K) is compact given X is compact, f is continuous, and K is compact in Y.\n\nIn the example provided by the user, the original problem had an incorrect assumption (n divisible by 7), but in the formatted problem, they corrected it to just n being an integer. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem had \"assumption: n is an integer, problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the original example, the user had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which was removed in the formatted version. Wait, no: the original problem's formatted version in the example lists the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7,\" but the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the original problem was that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. So the example seems to have an error because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. Wait, that example might have been a mistake. But regardless, the user's instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the problem as posed in the Math Stack Exchange question is: Given X and Y topological spaces, X compact, f: X→Y continuous, then is the preimage of each compact subset of Y compact? So the assumptions here are X compact, f continuous, K compact in Y, and the problem is to prove f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut in the original question, the user mentions that in Pugh's book, this is a theorem when X and Y are metric spaces, using sequential compactness. The question is whether the theorem holds in general topological spaces, using covering compactness.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- f: X → Y is continuous.\n- K is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user says \"the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact,\" so the problem is to prove that under the given assumptions (X compact, f continuous), the preimage of any compact K in Y is compact.\n\nHowever, in general topology, continuous functions from compact spaces have images that are compact, but preimages of compact sets under continuous functions are not necessarily compact unless additional conditions (like proper maps) are imposed. Wait, but in this case, the domain X is compact. If f: X→Y is continuous and X is compact, then for any subset K of Y, the preimage f⁻¹(K) is a closed subset of X (if K is closed), but since X is compact, closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. However, compactness in Y doesn't imply that K is closed unless Y is Hausdorff. Wait, but the problem doesn't assume Y is Hausdorff.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the original theorem as stated. Because in general, even if X is compact and f is continuous, the preimage of a compact set need not be compact. For example, take Y to be any space where a compact set K has a non-compact preimage. However, if X is compact, then any closed subset of X is compact. So if f is continuous and K is compact in Y, then f⁻¹(K) is closed in X (if Y is Hausdorff, since compact subsets in Hausdorff spaces are closed). Then f⁻¹(K) would be closed in X, hence compact. But if Y is not Hausdorff, then compact sets need not be closed, so f⁻¹(K) need not be closed, hence even though X is compact, f⁻¹(K) might not be compact.\n\nBut the original question is about whether the theorem in Pugh's book (which is in metric spaces) holds in general. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to being closed and totally bounded, and in Hausdorff spaces, compact sets are closed. So in the metric space case, since Y is Hausdorff, K is closed, so f⁻¹(K) is closed in X, hence compact. But in a general topological space, K might not be closed, so f⁻¹(K) might not be closed, and hence even if X is compact, f⁻¹(K) might not be compact.\n\nTherefore, the theorem as stated is not true in general topological spaces. Hence, the problem would be to determine whether the statement is true, and the answer would be no. But the user is asking whether it's true, and how to prove it with covering compactness. But perhaps there was a mistake in the original problem's statement.\n\nWait, but the user's question is: \"Is this theorem true in general (i.e., can it be proved with covering compactness alone)?\" So they're questioning the theorem's validity outside metric spaces. The answer would be that the theorem is not true in general topological spaces. However, perhaps the original theorem in Pugh's book has additional conditions, like Y being Hausdorff, which weren't mentioned.\n\nBut according to the user's question, the theorem in Pugh's book is stated for metric spaces, and the proof uses sequential compactness. The user wants to know if it's true in general. Therefore, structuring the problem as per the user's request, we need to present the assumptions as given in the theorem (X compact, f continuous, Y a topological space), and the problem is to prove that the preimage of a compact K in Y is compact.\n\nBut since the answer is that it's not true in general, perhaps the formatted problem should reflect the original theorem's statement as presented by the user, even if it's incorrect, so that the user can then analyze it. The user's task is to format the problem, not to correct it. So even if the theorem is false, the problem is as stated.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X and Y are topological spaces.\n- X is compact.\n- f: X → Y is continuous.\n- K is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut the user's question is whether this theorem is true in general, so perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Is the preimage f⁻¹(K) compact?\" But according to the example given, the problem was to \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" so following that structure, the problem here is to prove the statement, even if it's false. However, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the original question, filtering unrelated information. The original question is asking whether the theorem is true in general, so the problem is to determine the validity, but the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's formatted problem removed that and just stated n is an integer. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that can't be right. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would make the problem only for n divisible by 7, which is incorrect. So maybe the example provided by the user has a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we should proceed according to the instructions.\n\nBut perhaps the example was a bad example, but the instruction is to list the assumptions from the problem. So for the current problem, the original theorem as stated in the question is: Let X and Y be topological spaces, X compact, f: X→Y continuous. Then the preimage of each compact subset of Y is compact. The question is whether this is true in general.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a topological space.\n- Y is a topological space.\n- X is compact.\n- f: X → Y is continuous.\n- K is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that f⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\nBut the answer is that this is not true in general topological spaces. However, the user's task is to structure the problem, not to answer it. So even if the theorem is false, the problem is to present it as stated, filtered from the original question.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem as presented, regardless of their validity. The user's job is to format, not to correct.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a topological space,\nY is a topological space,\nX is compact,\nf : X → Y is continuous,\nK is a compact subset of Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the preimage f⁻¹(K) is compact.",
