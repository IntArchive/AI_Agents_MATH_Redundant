    "Content": "Let $S^2 = \\{x=(x_1,x_2,x_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3: x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1\\}$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $d_i(x,y) = \\cos^{-1}(x\\cdot y)$, where $x\\cdot y$ is the usual dot product of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, be the intrinsic metric on $S^2$ (the length of the great circle arc joining $x$ and $y$). Prove that $d_i$ satisfies the triangle inequality, $d_i(x,z) \\le d_i(x,y)+d_i(y,z)$. It has been suggested that I use the Gram Matrix $$A=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc}\nx\\cdot x &\\ & x\\cdot y &\\ & x\\cdot z \\\\\ny\\cdot x &\\ & y\\cdot y &\\ & y\\cdot z \\\\\nz\\cdot x &\\ & z\\cdot y &\\ & z\\cdot z \n\\end{array} \\right)$$ and the fact that $det(A) \\ge 0$ and somehow reduce the desired inequality, $\\cos^{-1}(x\\cdot z) \\le \\cos^{-1}(x\\cdot y)+\\cos^{-1}(y\\cdot z)$, to $det(A)\\ge 0$. I'm just missing out on how to do that. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote $\\theta_{xy}=\\cos^{-1}(x\\cdot y)$, $\\theta_{yz}=\\cos^{-1}(y\\cdot z)$ and $\\theta_{xz}=\\cos^{-1}(x\\cdot z)$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into their specified format. The example they provided shows breaking down the assumptions and the problem statement. So, first, I need to parse the Math Stack Exchange question about proving the triangle inequality on the sphere S² with the intrinsic metric d_i.\n\nThe original question mentions S² is the unit sphere in R³, defines d_i(x,y) as the inverse cosine of the dot product, which gives the arc length on the great circle. The problem is to prove that this metric satisfies the triangle inequality. They also mention using the Gram matrix A with determinant non-negative and reducing the inequality to det(A) ≥ 0.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. S² is the unit sphere in R³, defined by x₁² + x₂² + x₃² = 1.\n2. The intrinsic metric d_i(x, y) is defined as arccos(x·y), where x·y is the dot product.\n3. The Gram matrix A is given with entries x·x, x·y, x·z, etc.\n4. The determinant of A is non-negative (det(A) ≥ 0).\n5. The triangle inequality needs to be proven: d_i(x,z) ≤ d_i(x,y) + d_i(y,z).\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove the triangle inequality using the Gram determinant. The assumptions should list all given conditions. The problem statement is to prove the triangle inequality, so the user's instruction says each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me check:\n\n- The sphere S² is defined as the unit sphere. That's one assumption.\n- The metric d_i is defined as arccos of the dot product. Another assumption.\n- The Gram matrix A is constructed from the dot products of x, y, z. Third assumption.\n- The determinant of A is non-negative. Fourth assumption.\n- The suggestion to use det(A) ≥ 0 to reduce the inequality. But wait, the problem mentions that it's been suggested to use the Gram matrix and det(A) ≥ 0. So perhaps the fifth assumption is that det(A) ≥ 0? Wait, actually, the user's original problem says \"use the Gram Matrix A... and the fact that det(A) ≥ 0\". So the fact that det(A) ≥ 0 is part of the given information or a known result they can use. So the assumptions would include that det(A) ≥ 0.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included both the object's property (n is an integer) and a condition (n divisible by 7). However, the user's example might have been specific to that problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. But maybe the user intended to show how to filter assumptions. Maybe in that example, there was an additional constraint that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem doesn't say n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow their instructions regardless.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the assumptions should list each condition given. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nOriginal question:\n\n- S² is the unit sphere in R³ (so that's an assumption)\n- d_i(x,y) = arccos(x·y) is the intrinsic metric (another assumption)\n- The problem is to prove the triangle inequality for d_i.\n- The user is told to use the Gram matrix A with entries x·x, x·y, etc., and det(A) ≥ 0.\n\nSo the given information includes the definition of S², the definition of d_i, the Gram matrix A, and the fact that det(A) ≥ 0. The user's task is to use these to prove the triangle inequality.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n1. S² is the unit sphere in R³ defined by x₁² + x₂² + x₃² = 1.\n2. The intrinsic metric d_i(x, y) is defined as arccos(x·y), where x·y is the dot product.\n3. The Gram matrix A is constructed as specified (x·x, x·y, x·z; y·x, y·y, y·z; z·x, z·y, z·z).\n4. det(A) ≥ 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that d_i satisfies the triangle inequality using these assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"It has been suggested that I use the Gram Matrix... and the fact that det(A) ≥ 0...\". So the fact that det(A) ≥ 0 is part of the given information or a known result that can be applied here. Therefore, the assumption includes that det(A) is non-negative. So those four points are the assumptions. Each is a single property applied to one object (S², d_i, A, det(A)).\n\nThe problem is to prove the triangle inequality, which is stated as d_i(x,z) ≤ d_i(x,y) + d_i(y,z). So the formatted problem should have those assumptions and the problem statement.",
