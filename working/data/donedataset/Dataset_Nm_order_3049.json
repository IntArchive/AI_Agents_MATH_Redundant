    "Content": "Suppose that $G$ is a topological group and that $H$ is  a subgroup of $G$ so that $H$ and $G/H$ are compact. I am trying to show that $G$ must be compact. The first idea is to use the natural map $f: G \\rightarrow G/H$, this is a closed map since $H$ is compact. Thus if $\\mathscr{C}$ is a collection of closed subsets of $G$ with finite intersection property (FIP), then $\\{f(C): C \\in \\mathscr{C}\\}$ a collection of closed subsets of $G/H$. This collection also has FIP because $$f(C_1 \\cap \\ldots \\cap C_n) \\subseteq f(C_1) \\cap \\ldots \\cap f(C_n)$$ so $\\{f(C): C \\in \\mathscr{C}\\}$ has nonempty intersection because $G/H$ is compact. So there exists some coset $gH$ that is contained in every $f(C)$, that is $C \\cap gH$ is nonempty. My next idea would be to show that $\\{C \\cap gH: C \\in \\mathscr{C}\\}$ is a collection of closed sets in $gH$ with FIP. Then this collection, and thus $\\mathscr{C}$ would have nonempty intersection. We know that $C \\cap gH$ is closed in $gH$, but I don't know how to show that it has FIP. Right now I think that might not even be true in general, since our choice of $gH$ was arbitrary. How can I choose $gH$ in the intersection $\\cap_{C \\in \\mathscr{C}} f(C)$ so that $\\cap_{C \\in \\mathscr{C}} C \\cap gH$ is nonempty? Does this proof idea work?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The quotient map $f: G \\rightarrow G/H$ is perfect: it is continuous, closed (as $H$ is compact, as you say) and has compact fibres (inverse images of points are compact); the latter is clear as all fibres are homeomorphic to $H$. And the inverse image of a compact set under a perfect map is compact. And $G$ is the inverse image of $G/H$, which is compact by assumption. The proof of the latter is not too hard (some details left for you): Suppose $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is perfect, and let $K \\subset Y$ be compact.\nLet $U_i, i \\in I$ be an open cover of $f^{-1}[K]$. For each $k \\in K$, we can cover $f^{-1}[\\{k\\}]$ by finitely many of the $U_i$, call the union of these $U(k)$. Then $O(k) = Y\\setminus f[X \\setminus U(k)]$ is an open neighbourhood of $k$ in $Y$ (this uses $f$ is a closed map), so finitely many of them cover $K$. The corresponding $U(k)$, and thus the finitely many $U_i$ that compose them, are the required finite subcover of $f^{-1}[K]$. Another idea is to use that $G/H \\times H$ is also compact, and the product (the group product) map is probably (haven't checked the details) a map onto $G$ from this space.\nThis is maybe more appropriate for a course in topological groups...",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem step by step. The user is asking about proving that if H and G/H are compact in a topological group G, then G itself must be compact. The original question includes some attempted proof steps and specific points where the user is stuck. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that G is a topological group, H is a subgroup of G, and both H and the quotient space G/H are compact. The goal is to show G is compact. \n\nIn the example given earlier, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. So here, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a topological group.\n2. H is a subgroup of G.\n3. H is compact.\n4. G/H is compact.\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, G is compact. The user's attempt involves using the natural map f: G → G/H, which is closed due to H being compact. They consider a collection of closed sets with FIP, map them to G/H, use compactness there to find a common coset gH, and then try to show that intersecting these sets with gH preserves FIP. However, they are unsure about selecting the right gH and proving FIP in gH.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to filter out the user's specific proof attempt and questions, focusing only on the problem statement and its assumptions. The user's thought process about their proof steps is part of the original question but not part of the formatted problem we need to present. So the formatted problem should just list the assumptions and the problem statement as per the given example.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are each separate conditions: G being a topological group, H being a subgroup, H being compact, and G/H being compact. The problem is to prove G is compact under these conditions. The user's specific doubts about their method don't need to be included in the formatted problem.",
