    "Content": "This is from Spivak. Prove that $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. So far, I have this: If $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ is rational, then it can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$ with integral $p, q$ and in lowest terms. $$\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}=\\frac{p}{q}$$\n$$2\\sqrt{6}+5 =\\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n$$(2\\sqrt{6}+5)q^2=p^2$$ And that's about where I get stuck. In a similar question (prove that $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}$ is irrational,) I was able to show that both $p,q$ had to be even which is impossible. I obviously can't apply this trick here. Any hints?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$(\\sqrt3+\\sqrt2)(\\sqrt3-\\sqrt2)=3-2=1$ is rational, so if the first factor were rational, so would be the second, and their difference $2\\sqrt2$. But surely you know that the latter isn't rational.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that √2 + √3 is irrational. The user mentioned it's from Spivak and provided some steps they've taken. They squared both sides and ended up with an equation involving √6, which they're stuck on. They also referenced a similar problem where showing both p and q were even led to a contradiction, but that approach doesn't work here.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that √2 + √3 is rational, so that's one assumption. Then, they set it equal to p/q with integers p and q in lowest terms. So another assumption is that p and q are integers with no common factors. The steps they took involve squaring both sides, leading to an equation that includes √6. The challenge is to isolate the irrational part and show that it leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe example provided in the format lists each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property of a single object. So in this case, the key assumptions would be that √2 + √3 is rational, expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers in lowest terms. Each of these should be separate assumptions. There's no mention of divisibility by specific numbers here, unlike the example with 91 and 7. Instead, the contradiction arises from the presence of √6 in the equation, implying that if the original sum were rational, then √6 would also have to be rational, which it's not. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach where after squaring, you can rearrange terms to isolate √6 and then square again to eliminate the radical, leading to a contradiction in terms of the rationality of the numbers involved.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption 1: √2 + √3 is rational.\nAssumption 2: There exist integers p and q such that √2 + √3 = p/q.\nAssumption 3: p and q are coprime (since the fraction is in lowest terms).\n\nBut wait, the problem as presented by the user starts by assuming √2 + √3 is rational, hence expressed as p/q in lowest terms. The key steps involve squaring both sides to get 2√6 +5 = p²/q², then rearranging to (2√6 +5)q² = p². At this point, they're stuck because in the similar problem, they could show both p and q are even, but here that's not possible. \n\nThe next step might be to isolate √6. Let's see: from 2√6 +5 = p²/q², subtract 5 to get 2√6 = (p²/q²) -5. Then divide by 2: √6 = [ (p²/q²) -5 ] / 2. Then square again to eliminate the square root: 6 = [ (p²/q² -5 )² ] /4. Multiply both sides by 4: 24 = (p²/q² -5 )². Take square roots: ±√24 = p²/q² -5. But √24 is irrational, so p²/q² would have to be 5 ± √24, which is irrational. But p²/q² is supposed to be rational since p and q are integers. Therefore, contradiction arises, meaning the initial assumption that √2 + √3 is rational must be false.\n\nHowever, in the user's attempt, they got to (2√6 +5)q² = p². Since the left side includes √6, which is irrational, and the right side is an integer, that seems contradictory unless the coefficient of √6 is zero, but 2q² can't be zero for integers q. So perhaps another way to see the contradiction is that the left side has an irrational component, while the right side is rational, hence impossible. But the user might not have seen that directly, hence needing to proceed further.\n\nBut for the structured problem, the assumptions should be the conditions given or used in the problem. The problem itself is to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. The assumptions would then be that if it's rational, then it can be written as p/q in lowest terms. So each of those would be separate assumptions. Let's check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. √2 + √3 is rational.\n2. There exist integers p and q such that √2 + √3 = p/q.\n3. p and q are coprime (since the fraction is in lowest terms).\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't need to list all these assumptions. Looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Because in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which actually changes the problem from \"for every integer n\" to \"for every integer n divisible by 7\". That might be an error in the example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps the task is to filter the problem and list the necessary assumptions from the original question, even if they weren't explicitly stated? Wait, the original example's problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7; that was added in the formatted problem. So maybe the assistant added that assumption because the problem requires it? Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so maybe the formatted problem is wrong. But given that, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we have to follow their structure.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem about √2 + √3, the original problem is to prove it's irrational. The user's approach assumes it's rational and writes it as p/q. So the necessary assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that this leads to a contradiction, hence showing that √2 + √3 is irrational. But in the example, the formatted problem included the assumptions. Wait, the example's formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem was for every integer n. So the example seems to have introduced an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with the necessary assumptions, even if they are part of the proof steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, and the actual problem should not include the divisibility by 7. But since the user's example is given as such, we have to follow their format. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that this leads to a contradiction. But according to the example, the formatted problem includes the assumptions and the problem statement. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as the original problem, and the assumptions are the conditions given. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption, and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list all the conditions mentioned in the problem as assumptions. But in the case of proving √2 + √3 is irrational, the problem is to show that no such rational expression exists. The key assumption made in the proof by contradiction is that it is rational, so that's the main assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut that seems a bit tautological, as the problem is to prove the negation of the assumption. However, in proof by contradiction, we assume the opposite. So maybe in the formatted problem, the assumption is what is assumed for contradiction, and the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, hence proving the original statement. But according to the example given, the formatted problem includes the assumptions and then the problem statement. For the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem included an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user intended to extract the necessary conditions from the problem. But in that example, the divisibility by 7 might have been necessary for the proof, but it's not part of the original problem's statement. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the correct formatted problem should not include the divisibility by 7. But given that the user provided the example, we have to follow their structure. For the current problem, the user's question is to prove √2 + √3 is irrational, starting from the assumption that it's rational (p/q in lowest terms), then squaring to get an equation involving √6. The problem is to structure this as per the format, which requires listing assumptions and the problem.\n\nPerhaps the assumptions are the steps taken in the proof approach. For example:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 = p/q where p and q are integers.\n\nAssumption: p and q are coprime.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, proving that √2 + √3 is irrational. However, the example given by the user added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). So maybe the task is to extract the necessary conditions from the problem statement and the proof steps. But in the current problem, the original problem statement is just \"Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\" The user's attempt starts by assuming it's rational, hence expressed as p/q in lowest terms. The necessary assumptions for the problem would then be:\n\n1. √2 + √3 is rational.\n2. There exist integers p and q such that √2 + √3 = p/q.\n3. p and q are coprime (lowest terms).\n\nBut these are all part of the proof by contradiction, not the problem's explicit assumptions. However, according to the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions from the problem statement and possibly additional ones needed for the proof. But the example seems to have added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which might be a mistake. If we follow that pattern, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem would list the assumptions made in the proof approach, such as the rationality of √2 + √3, but the problem statement remains to prove the opposite. But that would be contradictory.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem changed it to an assumption that n is divisible by 7 and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. That seems like a mistake because if n is divisible by 7, then 91 is 13*7, but the original problem was for all integers n. Therefore, the example might be incorrect. Given that, perhaps we should focus on the current problem correctly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption: <list of assumptions>\n\nProblem: <the problem statement>\n\nThe original problem is \"Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\" The user's attempt starts by assuming it's rational, hence expressed as p/q. So the key assumptions for the proof by contradiction are:\n\n1. √2 + √3 is rational.\n2. p and q are integers with no common factors.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions, and the problem is to derive a contradiction, hence proving the original statement. But the problem statement itself is to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. So in the format, it would be:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nAssumption: There exist integers p and q such that √2 + √3 = p/q.\n\nAssumption: p and q are coprime.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions, a contradiction arises. However, in the example, the problem was rephrased as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the formatted problem should include the assumptions used in the proof, and the problem is to reach the conclusion. In this case, the problem would be to show that the initial assumption (rationality) leads to a contradiction, hence proving irrationality. But the way the example is structured, the problem is stated as the original goal, and the assumptions are the conditions given. It's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the premises given in the problem, and the problem is what needs to be proven. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is the assumption, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that the user might have intended to extract hidden assumptions or necessary conditions for the proof. However, that seems incorrect. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the assumptions explicitly stated in the problem. The original problem here is to prove that √2 + √3 is irrational. There are no explicit assumptions given in the problem statement other than the properties of integers and rational numbers. However, in the user's attempt, they assume it's rational and express it as p/q in lowest terms. So perhaps the formatted problem should list those as assumptions for the sake of the proof by contradiction. But according to the example, even if the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, it was added as an assumption. Therefore, following that pattern, here the assumptions would include the supposition for contradiction:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nAssumption: There exist integers p and q with q ≠ 0 such that √2 + √3 = p/q.\n\nAssumption: p and q are coprime.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the problem is the negation of the first assumption. However, given the example provided, which adds an extra assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the assumptions made in the proof process, even if they are part of the proof technique (like assuming rationality for contradiction). But in the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91 for all integers n, and the formatted problem added an assumption about divisibility by 7, which is part of the factorization of 91 (7*13). So perhaps in the current problem, the key assumption is that √2 + √3 is rational, leading to the problem of proving it's irrational, which is the original question.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut this seems like stating the problem as the assumption and the problem being its negation. However, in proof by contradiction, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove. So perhaps the formatted problem is structured to present the assumption for contradiction and then the problem is to show that this leads to the desired result. But the example doesn't follow that; instead, the example lists assumptions that are given as part of the problem's conditions. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to follow the user's example as closely as possible, even if it seems flawed.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have that condition. However, maybe the user intended to break down the problem into cases or highlight necessary conditions. For the current problem, perhaps the assumption is that √2 + √3 can be expressed as a fraction p/q in lowest terms, leading to the problem of proving that this assumption is false.\n\nTherefore, structuring the current problem:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 can be written as p/q where p and q are integers.\n\nAssumption: p and q are coprime.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nBut the problem is already to prove that, so perhaps the correct way is to list the assumptions used in the proof, which are the suppositions for contradiction. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: √2 + √3 is rational.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 + √3 is irrational.\n\nThis mirrors the example where the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer. Even though in the example, the formatted problem added an extra assumption, perhaps here it's better to stay true to the original problem and list the main assumption for contradiction as the assumption, and the problem as the original statement.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ is rational,\nThere exist integers $p$ and $q$ such that $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{p}{q}$,\n$p$ and $q$ are coprime.\nProblem: Prove that $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.\n###\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property of one object.
