    "Content": "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions such that $g$ is continuous at $a$, and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$. Show the composition $f(g(x))$ is continuous at $a$. My idea: Can I go straight from definition and take $\\delta=\\min\\{\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\}$, where $\\delta_1$ is used for the continuity of $g$ at $a$ and $\\delta_2$ is used for f being continuous at $g(a)$. In my proof I just treat $g(a)$ as a point when referring to the composition. So it goes like this: Proof: Given $\\epsilon>0$, take $\\delta=\\min\\{\\delta_1,\\delta_2\\}$. Then $0<|x-g(a)|<\\delta$ which implies $|f(g(x))-f(g(a))|<\\epsilon$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, our definition of continuity tells us that for all $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is some $\\delta_1$ such that $$|g(x) - g(a)| < \\delta_1\\implies|f(g(x))-f(g(a))|<\\varepsilon.$$\nAlso, since $g$ is continuous at $a$, there is some $\\delta$ such that $$|x-a|<\\delta \\implies |g(x)-g(a)|<\\delta_1.$$\nI've taken $\\varepsilon =\\delta_1$ here.  Now this tells us that for all $\\varepsilon > 0$ there is some $\\delta > 0$ (and a $\\delta_1 > 0$) such that $$|x-a| < \\delta\\implies|g(x)-g(a)|<\\delta_1\\implies|f(g(x)) - f(g(a))|<\\varepsilon,$$\nwhich is what we wanted to show.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The user is asking to show that the composition f(g(x)) is continuous at a, given that g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a). The assumptions here are about the continuity of g and f at specific points. \n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The first assumption is that g is a function continuous at point a. The second assumption is that f is a function continuous at g(a). Each of these is a separate condition applied to each function (g at a, f at g(a)). \n\nThe problem statement then is to show that the composition f∘g is continuous at a. \n\nThe user's example formatted the assumptions with each condition on its own line, so following that, I should list each continuity condition separately. \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only about one property (continuity) of one object (either f or g). So, \"g is continuous at a\" is one assumption, and \"f is continuous at g(a)\" is another. \n\nThe problem part will then restate the task: Show that the composition f(g(x)) is continuous at a.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions that f and g are functions, but since the example didn't include the fact that they are functions as an assumption, maybe it's considered part of the problem statement. However, the original user's problem states \"Suppose f and g are functions such that...\", so perhaps being functions is part of the problem's premise but not an assumption that needs to be listed. The example given in the initial prompt didn't list \"A(n) is a function\" as an assumption, so perhaps the role here is similar. Therefore, the key assumptions are the continuity points.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have two assumptions: one for g being continuous at a, and another for f being continuous at g(a). Then the problem is to show the composition is continuous at a.",
