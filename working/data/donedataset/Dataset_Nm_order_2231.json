    "Content": "While browsing the internet today, I came across the following picture: (full image can be found here - credit to Цогтгэрэл Гантөмөр) Now, it would naturally seem we can extend this to an infinite product; specifically, I would guess from this post that we have $$\\bbox[5px,border:2px solid red]{ \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}}}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}}}} \\cdots}$$ where we define this product formally by $$\\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{a_n} $$ where $a_n$ is defined by $a_n = \\sqrt{2+a_{n-1}}$ with initial value $a_0 = \\sqrt{3}.$ However, I have never seen this expression for $\\pi$ in the literature. Given this product comes from a geometric argument bounding the value of $\\pi,$ I would fully expect this product to be studied, but I do not know where to look. The most similar product I am aware of is $$\\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\cdots$$ namely formula $(65)$ on this page . I would imagine that, like this similar looking formula for $\\frac{2}{\\pi},$ the above product for $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ should be the result of evaluating some rational function of trigonometric functions, but how to go about this is not immediately clear to me. Is anyone aware of an existing proof or refutation of this product in the literature, or else can provide one? Edit 1: I have numerically checked this with the following quick and dirty Javascript code, which seems to imply convergence is decently rapid: a = Math.sqrt(3);\npiEstimate = 1;\nfor (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n  a = Math.sqrt(2 + a);\n  piEstimate *= 2/a;\n}\nconsole.log(3 * piEstimate)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The nested square roots suggest Viète's formula and one way that formula can be derived, Euler's product identity for the sinc function: $$\\frac{\\sin x}x=\\cos\\frac x2\\cos\\frac x4\\cos\\frac x8\\dots$$ Viète's formula is obtained by substituting $x=\\frac\\pi2$ . We use $x=\\frac\\pi3$ instead: $$\\frac{\\sin\\pi/3}{\\pi/3}=\\cos\\frac\\pi6\\cos\\frac\\pi{12}\\cos\\frac\\pi{24}\\dots$$ $$\\frac{\\sqrt3/2}{\\pi/3}=\\frac{\\sqrt3}2\\cos\\frac\\pi{12}\\cos\\frac\\pi{24}\\dots$$ $$\\frac3\\pi=\\cos\\frac\\pi{12}\\cos\\frac\\pi{24}\\dots$$ By applying the half-angle formula $\\cos\\frac x2=\\sqrt{\\frac{1+\\cos x}2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2+2\\cos x}}2$ repeatedly we get $$\\cos\\frac\\pi{12}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}}2$$ $$\\cos\\frac\\pi{24}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}}}2$$ and so on, yielding $$\\frac3\\pi=\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}}2\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}}}2\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt3}}}}2\\cdots$$ and from there the desired expression for $\\pi$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The title mentions an identity for π/3 involving an infinite product of terms with nested square roots. The user defines a recursive sequence a_n where each term is sqrt(2 + a_{n-1}) starting with a_0 = sqrt(3). The product is then 2/a_n for each n, and they claim this product equals π/3. They also mention checking it numerically with code.\n\nNow, the example provided in the problem shows how assumptions are listed. The key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the problem, the main elements are:\n1. The product is formally defined as π/3 = product from n=1 to infinity of 2/a_n.\n2. The sequence a_n is defined recursively: a_n = sqrt(2 + a_{n-1}).\n3. The initial term a_0 is sqrt(3).\n4. The user is asking for a proof or refutation of this identity.\n\nWait, the example given in the original problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions would be about the sequence definition and the product. The problem is to prove the identity. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n- The product is defined as π/3 = product from n=1 to ∞ of 2/a_n.\n- The sequence a_n is defined by a_n = sqrt(2 + a_{n-1}).\n- The initial value a_0 is sqrt(3).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that this product equals π/3. The user's question also mentions that they checked it numerically, but that's part of the context, not an assumption. The core assumptions are the recursive definition of a_n and the product expression. \n\nTherefore, structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nThe product is defined as π/3 = ∏_{n=1}^∞ (2/a_n),\na_n is defined by a_n = √(2 + a_{n-1}),\na_0 = √3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that π/3 equals the infinite product (2/√(2+√3)) * (2/√(2+√(2+√3))) * ... .\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line addressing one property. The problem statement is the main identity to prove. The user's original problem also mentions that they haven't seen this in literature and are asking for a proof or refutation, but the formatted problem should just state the problem to prove.",
