    "Content": "I want to prove that a sequence of real numbers $\\{s_n\\}$ converges to $s$ if and only if $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = s$. Here are my definitions: For any sequence of real numbers $\\{s_n\\}$, let $E$ be the set of all subsequential limits of $\\{s_n\\}$, including possibly $+\\infty$ and/or $-\\infty$ if any subsequence of $\\{s_n\\}$ diverges to infinity.  Then $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\sup E$, and $\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\inf E$. I know the theorem that a sequence converges to a point if and only if every one of its subsequences converge to that same point, so one direction of this proof is easy: If $\\{s_n\\}$ converges to some point $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$,  then every subsequence of $\\{s_n\\}$ converges to $s$.  So the set $E$ of every subsequential limit of $\\{s_n\\}$ consists of the single point $s$, so\n$$\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\sup \\{s\\} = s = \\inf \\{s\\} = \\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n$$ But the other direction seems more tricky... If $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = \\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = s$, then every convergent subsequence converges to the same point $s$.  Also, there can be no subsequences which diverge to infinity (otherwise $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n$ would be $+\\infty$, or $\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n$ would be $-\\infty$). But can't there be subsequences which diverge otherwise?  And wouldn't that throw off the convergence of $\\{s_n\\}$? EDIT: I'd also be willing to accept a solution which makes use of the \"Pinching Theorem\" (if $a_n \\leq s_n \\leq b_n$ for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and if $a_n \\to s$ and $b_n \\to s$, then $s_n \\to s$).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Useful facts that you should verify: Any unbounded sequence has a subsequence diverging to $\\infty$ or to $-\\infty$. Any bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. You correctly point out that the hypothesis that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n$ and $\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} s_n$ are both finite implies that $(s_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ has no subsequences that diverge to infinity.  But (1) implies that more is true: the sequence $(s_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ must be bounded . Fix any $\\epsilon > 0$. There cannot be infinitely many $n$ for which $s_n \\geq s + \\epsilon$, because you  could select out of them a subsequence $y_k = s_{n_k}$ satisfying $y_k \\geq s + \\epsilon$ for all $k$. Since the sequence $(s_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is bounded, so is the sequence $(y_k)_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.  So by (2) it has a subsequence convergent to some limit $L$; and by basic facts about limits, since $y_k \\geq  s + \\epsilon$ for all $k$, one must have $L \\geq s + \\epsilon$. But $L$ is clearly also a subsequential limit of $s$, allowing us to deduce that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} s_n \\geq s + \\epsilon$, a contradiction. Similarly, there cannot be infinitely many $n$ for which $s_n \\leq s - \\epsilon$. So there is a positive integer $N$ with the property that whenever $n \\geq N$ one has\n$$\ns - \\epsilon < s_n < s + \\epsilon,\n$$\nand since $\\epsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, $(s_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ converges to $s$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Sequence converges iff limsup = liminf\". The user is trying to prove that a sequence {s_n} converges to s if and only if the limsup and liminf of the sequence are both equal to s. \n\nThe original problem statement includes definitions of limsup and liminf as the supremum and infimum of the set E of all subsequential limits, including infinities. The user mentions they know one direction (if the sequence converges, then limsup and liminf are equal to the limit), but the converse is tricky. They are concerned about subsequences that might diverge in other ways and how that affects convergence. They also mention using the Pinching Theorem.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove the equivalence. The original problem states that {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers. The definitions of limsup and liminf are given, but those might not be assumptions but part of the problem's context. However, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The sequence {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n2. The limsup of {s_n} as n approaches infinity is equal to s.\n3. The liminf of {s_n} as n approaches infinity is equal to s.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that convergence implies limsup and liminf equal, and vice versa. So when structuring, perhaps the problem is split into two directions. But the user is focusing on the converse: if limsup = liminf = s, then the sequence converges to s.\n\nBut in the original question, they want the equivalence. However, the example provided in the initial problem (the divisible by 91 one) included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, the original didn't have that, the user added it. Wait, no. Wait in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem under assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like maybe there was a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Because the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that's not in the original problem. Wait, that seems like an error. But perhaps it's part of the problem's actual conditions? Wait, maybe I need to check. Let me recheck the example:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe the example had a mistake. Perhaps the correct assumption should be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Maybe the user made a mistake here, but regardless, I need to follow the instructions to structure the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove the equivalence: {s_n} converges to s iff limsup s_n = liminf s_n = s. The user mentions their definitions, but the key assumptions here would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that under these conditions, the sequence converges. However, the original problem also includes the converse direction (if the sequence converges, then limsup and liminf equal s). But in the example, they split the problem into one direction. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. So maybe there's a misunderstanding. But given that, perhaps I should focus on the problem as stated by the user.\n\nThe user's problem is to prove that a sequence converges to s if and only if limsup and liminf are both equal to s. The problem includes both directions. But the example provided seems to have filtered out some conditions. However, in this case, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is about equivalence, the assumptions might be split based on each direction.\n\nWait, but the problem is structured as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under assumptions. But in the example, they changed the original problem's \"for every integer n\" into an assumption that n is an integer and added n divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. So that's confusing. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem accordingly.\n\nSo for the current problem: \"Prove that a sequence of real numbers {s_n} converges to s if and only if limsup s_n = liminf s_n = s.\"\n\nThe assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut since it's an equivalence, the problem is to prove both directions. However, the user's original question is focusing on the converse direction (if limsup and liminf equal s, then the sequence converges). The problem as stated by the user is the equivalence, so the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was an assertion for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption. So perhaps the user wants to split the problem into each direction with respective assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions could list the properties required for each direction. But the example seems to have filtered out some conditions. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user in the example made a mistake. But I need to proceed regardless.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the main assumptions are:\n\nFor the forward direction (if the sequence converges, then limsup = liminf = s), the assumptions are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- {s_n} converges to s.\n\nFor the converse direction (if limsup = liminf = s, then the sequence converges), the assumptions are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut the problem as stated is to prove the equivalence. However, the example given by the user split the problem into one direction with specific assumptions. Maybe the user wants to structure the problem as a bidirectional proof, but in the example, only one direction was presented. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to split the problem into two separate parts.\n\nBut given the example, which took an original problem that was a universal statement and added specific assumptions, perhaps the current problem should be structured with the general problem and then list the necessary assumptions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem changed it to assume n is an integer and divisible by 7, then prove A(n) is divisible by 91. That changes the original problem. But that seems incorrect. Unless there was a misunderstanding. But maybe the user in the example made a mistake. However, since the user provided that example as guidance, I need to follow their formatting, even if it's erroneous.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that {s_n} converges to s.\n\nBut the original problem is an equivalence. So the other direction is: If {s_n} converges to s, then limsup and liminf are equal to s. In that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- {s_n} converges to s.\n\nProblem: Prove that limsup s_n = liminf s_n = s.\n\nBut the original question is to prove the equivalence. However, the user's example formatted the problem with assumptions leading to the conclusion. Since the user's example seems to have altered the original problem, perhaps in the current case, we need to structure it as follows.\n\nThe original problem is to prove an equivalence. But the user's example took a universal statement and added a specific assumption. So perhaps in this case, we need to split the problem into two parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated is to prove that a sequence converges if and only if limsup equals liminf. So the problem would be stated as such, and the assumptions would include the conditions for each direction.\n\nBut following the example's structure, which took the original problem's conclusion and added assumptions, perhaps here, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nWait, but the example seems to have added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the example.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the current problem should be structured with the necessary assumptions for the converse direction, as the user is struggling with that part.\n\nThe user mentions in their question that they know the forward direction (convergence implies limsup = liminf = s), but the converse is tricky. So perhaps the formatted problem is focusing on the converse direction. Hence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nProblem: Prove that {s_n} converges to s.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove the entire equivalence, then the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- Either {s_n} converges to s, or limsup_{n→∞} s_n = liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut that's not line by line. Alternatively, since it's an equivalence, maybe the problem is split into two parts. But the example given didn't do that; it focused on one direction.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions required for one direction. Since the user is asking about the entire equivalence, but their example only formatted one direction, perhaps we need to list all the assumptions for each direction.\n\nBut the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the task is to list the assumptions of the problem, which are the given conditions, and then state the problem.\n\nIn the original problem, the problem is to prove the equivalence. The assumptions would be:\n\n1. {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n2. For the forward direction: {s_n} converges to s.\n3. For the converse direction: limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s and liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut since it's an equivalence, perhaps the problem is stated as such, and the assumptions are the general conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that a sequence converges iff limsup = liminf = s, with the assumptions being:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- Either {s_n} converges to s, or limsup and liminf equal s.\n\nBut the example given in the user's prompt added specific assumptions not present in the original problem. However, that might have been an error. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions provided. But the user's example extracted assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem's \"for every integer n\" was converted into an assumption that n is an integer, but added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo, but according to the given example, the user structured it that way. Therefore, perhaps in this task, when structuring the problem, we need to list all the conditions given in the problem as assumptions, even if they are part of the universal quantifier.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem states: \"a sequence of real numbers {s_n} converges to s if and only if limsup s_n = liminf s_n = s\". The conditions here are that {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers, and the equality of limsup and liminf to s. But since it's an equivalence, both directions need to be considered. However, the user's example seems to have taken a universal statement and turned it into an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumptions are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that {s_n} converges to s if and only if limsup_{n→∞} s_n = liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut the example included specific assumptions beyond the universal quantifier. So maybe the answer is to list the assumptions as the properties of the objects involved. For example, in the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- The limsup of {s_n} as n approaches infinity is equal to s.\n- The liminf of {s_n} as n approaches infinity is equal to s.\n\nProblem: Prove that {s_n} converges to s.\n\nBut this captures only one direction of the equivalence. The original problem is bidirectional. However, the user's example formatted a problem with assumptions leading to the conclusion, even if the original problem was a universal statement. Given that, perhaps the correct structure for the current problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that {s_n} converges to s if and only if limsup_{n→∞} s_n = liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut the example had multiple assumptions. Alternatively, considering that the original problem is an equivalence, the assumptions might be split into two parts. But according to the user's example, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. In the example, the original problem was a universal statement, but the formatted problem added specific assumptions. That might be incorrect, but perhaps following that, for the current problem, we list the general conditions:\n\nAssumptions:\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- For the forward direction: {s_n} converges to s.\n- For the reverse direction: limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s and liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nBut this conflates two directions into one problem. However, the user's example didn't do that. The example took the original problem, which was to prove for all n, and structured it with assumptions about n, leading to the conclusion.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to follow the structure of the example, even if it seems flawed. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the formatted problem seems to have added an extra assumption (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. However, if we have to follow that, perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement.\n\nBut the current problem's original statement is: Prove that a sequence of real numbers {s_n} converges to s if and only if limsup = liminf = s. The user then provides their definitions and thoughts.\n\nFollowing the example's approach, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nProblem: Prove that {s_n} converges to s.\n\nBut this captures only one direction of the equivalence. The original problem is bidirectional. However, the example given by the user also only addressed one direction (from n being an integer and divisible by 7 to divisibility by 91), even though the original problem was for all integers. This suggests that maybe the user wants to split the problem into each direction. But in the example, they didn't; they changed the original problem's conclusion by adding an assumption.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, perhaps the correct approach is to structure the problem as per the original problem's statement, listing the necessary assumptions for each direction. But since the user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem, perhaps here we need to list the general assumptions and then the problem as the equivalence.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem was a universal statement, the formatted problem added specific assumptions. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- If {s_n} converges, then limsup and liminf equal s.\n- If limsup and liminf equal s, then {s_n} converges to s.\n\nBut that's circular. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are just the basic definitions, but the example didn't do that. The example took the universal statement and added specific assumptions, which might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the problem is dealing with, like the sequence being real, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which were not all present in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I have to follow it.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- limsup_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n- liminf_{n→∞} s_n = s.\n\nProblem: Prove that {s_n} converges to s.\n\nThis captures the converse direction, which the user is having trouble with. The forward direction is considered straightforward, as per the user's comment. Therefore, the formatted problem focuses on the non-trivial direction.",
