    "Content": "Let $\\lbrace e_n \\rbrace$ for the standard unit vectors in $l_2$. I want to show that $0$ is in weak closure of $\\lbrace\\sqrt{n}e_n\\rbrace$ but no subsequence of $\\lbrace \\sqrt{n}e_n\\rbrace$ weakly converges to 0. For the second assertion, I have the following answer. If $\\lbrace \\sqrt{n_k}e_{n_k}\\rbrace$ be weakly convergent subsequence, then it must be norm-bounded. However, $\\| \\sqrt{n_k}e_{n_k}\\|=\\sqrt{n_k}\\to \\infty$ as $k\\to \\infty$ which is a contradiction. However, for the first assertion, I cannot figure it out that the difference between the condition that 0 lies in weak closure of sequence and the condition that there is a subsequence weakly converges to 0. Thanks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is working on a problem involving weak closures in the space l_2. The main goal is to show two things: first, that 0 is in the weak closure of the set {√n e_n}, and second, that no subsequence of this set weakly converges to 0. They've already figured out the second part using the fact that a weakly convergent subsequence must be norm-bounded, but the norm here goes to infinity, hence a contradiction. However, they're confused about the first part—understanding the difference between 0 being in the weak closure and having a subsequence that weakly converges to 0.\n\nSo, first, I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by identifying the assumptions. The problem mentions l_2 space, standard unit vectors e_n, the sequence {√n e_n}, and the two assertions about weak closure and no subsequence weakly converging to 0. The user also references their own attempt for the second part but is stuck on the first.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the key objects are the sequence {√n e_n}, the space l_2, the unit vectors e_n, and the assertions about weak closure and subsequences.\n\nAssumptions should include that {e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2, that the sequence in question is {√n e_n}, and perhaps that they are considering the weak closure in l_2. The problem is to show two things: 0 is in the weak closure, and no subsequence weakly converges to 0. However, in the example given, the problem statement was simplified to just the problem part, with assumptions listed separately. So I need to list all the underlying assumptions here.\n\nWait, the original problem states that e_n are standard unit vectors in l_2. Then the sequence is {√n e_n}. The two assertions are about 0 being in the weak closure and no subsequence weakly converging to 0. The user's confusion is about the difference between these two conditions. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- {e_n} are the standard unit vectors in l_2.\n- The sequence under consideration is {√n e_n}.\n- The space is l_2 with its weak topology.\n\nBut the problem is to show two things. However, the example given in the original instruction had a problem statement that was a single statement (prove A(n) is divisible by 91), but here the problem has two parts. The user is focusing on the first part, but the problem as stated in the original question includes both assertions. However, when formatting, we need to present the problem as stated, so the problem part should include both assertions. But in the example, they filtered the original problem's assumptions and structured them. Here, the original problem says \"Let {e_n} be the standard unit vectors in l_2. I want to show that 0 is in weak closure of {√n e_n} but no subsequence of {√n e_n} weakly converges to 0.\"\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- {e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2.\n- The sequence is {√n e_n}.\n\nThe problem is to show two things: 0 is in the weak closure of the sequence, and no subsequence of the sequence weakly converges to 0. However, the user's main confusion is about the first part, but the problem as stated includes both. So the formatted problem should include both parts. The example given in the original instruction had assumptions like n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more about the setup of the space and the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n{e_n} are the standard unit vectors in l_2,\nThe sequence is {√n e_n}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0 is in the weak closure of {√n e_n} but no subsequence of {√n e_n} weakly converges to 0.\n\nBut the user also mentions that they have an answer for the second assertion but are confused about the first. However, in the formatting, the problem is presented as per the original question, not the user's specific confusion. The user's question is part of the content, but the task is to structure the original problem as per the format. Wait, the user is providing the original problem from Math Stack Exchange, which is the question titled \"On the weak closure\", and the content is the user's question. So the original problem is as stated in the \"Question\" part.\n\nWait, the user says: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the original problem is the user's question, which starts with \"Let {e_n} be the standard unit vectors in l_2...\". So the task is to extract the problem from that, list the assumptions, and then state the problem.\n\nThe user's own discussion about their attempt is part of the question but should be filtered out. So the original problem is:\n\n\"Let {e_n} be the standard unit vectors in l_2. I want to show that 0 is in the weak closure of {√n e_n} but no subsequence of {√n e_n} weakly converges to 0.\"\n\nThen, the user's own attempt and confusion follow, but those are to be filtered out.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- {e_n} are the standard unit vectors in l_2.\n- The sequence is {√n e_n}.\n- Considering the weak closure in l_2.\n\nBut the problem is to show two things. So structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n{e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2,\nThe sequence under consideration is {√n e_n},\nThe space is l_2 with the weak topology.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0 is in the weak closure of {√n e_n} but no subsequence of {√n e_n} weakly converges to 0.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So \"The sequence under consideration is {√n e_n}\" is one assumption. \"{e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2\" is another. The space being l_2 is maybe implicit, but perhaps needs to be stated. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the main assumptions are:\n\n- {e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2.\n- The sequence is defined as {√n e_n}.\n\nThe problem is to show two properties. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n{e_n} are standard unit vectors in l_2,\nThe sequence is {√n e_n}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 0 is in the weak closure of {√n e_n} but no subsequence of {√n e_n} weakly converges to 0.\n\nThis seems to align with the example where assumptions are listed and the problem is stated. The user's own confusion about the difference between weak closure and subsequence convergence is part of their question but not part of the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem should capture the original problem's setup and the two assertions to prove.",
