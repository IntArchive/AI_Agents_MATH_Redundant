    "Content": "Call a \"torus\" that geometric shape that \"looks like\" a doughnut. Frequently, one encounters the assertion that $S^1 \\times S^1$ is a \"torus\" where $S^1$ is the unit circle. Now, if I think about this, I can understand the justification for calling this a torus, but I'm trying to understand how one would go about actually proving this. Indeed, there exist analytical descriptions of the torus such as this one provided by Wikipedia. So one could theoretically, with enough inspiration, find a homemorphism $h: S^1 \\times S^1 \\rightarrow G(T)$ where $G(T)$ denotes the graph of the torus as realized by the analytical description. This approach, assuming it works, uses coordinates and in any event wouldn't be very enlightening. So, my question is, is there a coordinate-free way to prove that $S^1 \\times S^1$ is homeomorphic to this thing we call a doughnut? My thoughts on this are: I believe what is key is how one chooses to define a torus. I am familiar with constructing a torus by identifying opposite sides of a rectangle and this seems like a pretty natural definition. It is intuitively clear that if the rectangle is configured as\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nA---- & B \\\\\n|\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;&| \\\\\nC---- & D\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nthen one can map one circle homeomorphically onto the identification of AB and CD and then the other circle onto the identification of AC and BD. However, this really isn't a very precise argument and it seems to me that making it precise would eventually involve coordinates. Am I onto the right track with this approach or is there a better way of looking at the problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think you're thinking of it in the right way, but you're also trying to have your cake and eat it here. If you want a completely rigorous argument, you can't get around having a rigorous description of the 3d shape that you're trying to prove homeomorphic to $S^1\\times S^1$ in the first place. But that means, in particular, that you need a well-defined way of speaking on particular points on the geometrical torus, and how would you do that if not by coordinates? In fact, one doesn't need that much inspiration to find a concrete coordinate-based homeomorphism. Let's define $S^1$ as the set $\\{(x,y)\\mid x^2+y^2=1\\}\\subset \\mathbb R^2$ with the subspace topology. Then,\n$$h((x,y),(z,w)) = z(0,0,1)+(w+2)(x,y,0)$$\nis your desired homeomorphism, into the set\n$$\\{(x,y,z)\\mid z^2 + \\Bigl(2-\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\Bigr)^2 = 1\\}\\subset \\mathbb R^3$$\nwhich one ought to recognize as our geometrical torus. To describe this as \"not very enlightening\" would be fair if it was about purely formal algebraic manipulation or black-box recipes for computation -- but in fact it has a clear geometric significance. One might say, instead: For each $(x,y)$ we draw the $(z,w)$ circle on a vertical plane through the origin and oriented such that it passes through $(x,y)$, with the center of the $(z,w)$ circle being offset by $2$ units in the direction of $(x,y)$. However, such a verbal description risks getting complex and hard to grasp, and it is all too easy for the writer to introduce ambiguities where it can be understood only if the reader already understands which construction is meant. The coordinate formulas, on the other hand, are unambiguous, and with a bit of practice one can see the geometric construction directly in them.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the product of two circles, S¹ × S¹, is homeomorphic to a torus (the doughnut shape) using a coordinate-free method. The user mentions the standard approach using coordinates and wants a more intuitive, coordinate-free proof, possibly through quotient spaces or identifications.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The torus is defined as the geometric shape resembling a doughnut. So, one assumption is that we're talking about the standard torus, which is a surface of genus one.\n2. S¹ is the unit circle. So, each S¹ in the product is the standard unit circle in Euclidean space.\n3. The problem involves showing a homeomorphism between S¹ × S¹ and the torus. Homeomorphism means a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.\n4. The user references constructing a torus by identifying opposite sides of a rectangle. That's the quotient space approach, where a square's opposite edges are glued. So another assumption is that the torus can be defined as the quotient space [0,1] × [0,1] with (0,y) ~ (1,y) and (x,0) ~ (x,1). This is the standard way to define a torus as a quotient space.\n5. The user suggests mapping one circle to the identification of AB and CD (the horizontal sides) and the other to AC and BD (the vertical sides). So, perhaps the idea is that each circle in S¹ × S¹ corresponds to one of these identifications.\n\nWait, but the user is trying to link the product S¹ × S¹ to the quotient space definition. So, perhaps the key is that S¹ itself is a quotient space of the interval [0,1] with 0 and 1 identified. Therefore, S¹ × S¹ would be the product of two such quotients, which should correspond to the quotient of the square [0,1] × [0,1] with both pairs of opposite sides identified. Hence, the product space S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the quotient space that defines the torus. But the user wants to do this without coordinates, so maybe using the universal property of quotient spaces or some categorical argument?\n\nBut the problem is to structure the assumptions and the problem. Let me extract the assumptions from the question:\n\n- S¹ is the unit circle.\n- The torus is defined as the result of identifying opposite sides of a rectangle (quotient space).\n- The homeomorphism should be established between S¹ × S¹ and this quotient space.\n- The approach should be coordinate-free, not relying on explicit coordinate mappings.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nS¹ is the unit circle,\nThe torus is defined as the quotient space obtained by identifying opposite edges of the rectangle [0,1] × [0,1],\nThe homeomorphism is to be established without using explicit coordinate maps.\n\nProblem: Prove that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the torus (defined as the quotient space of [0,1] × [0,1] with opposite edges identified) using a coordinate-free method.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"this thing we call a doughnut\". However, mathematically, the doughnut shape is typically embedded in 3D space, but the user mentions the analytical description (like from Wikipedia) which is often the parametrization. But they want a coordinate-free proof. So perhaps the key is to define the torus as the quotient space, and then show that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to that quotient space.\n\nAlternatively, if the torus is defined as the embedded surface in R³, then showing homeomorphism to S¹ × S¹ would involve some parametrization, but the user wants a coordinate-free way. However, the user also mentions constructing the torus via identifying rectangle sides, which is a coordinate-free definition (as a quotient space). So perhaps the problem is to show that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the quotient space [0,1]² / ~ where ~ glues opposite edges.\n\nSo, in that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- S¹ is the quotient space [0,1]/~ where 0 ~ 1.\n- The torus is defined as the quotient space [0,1] × [0,1]/~ where (0,y) ~ (1,y) and (x,0) ~ (x,1).\n- The product space S¹ × S¹ is considered with the product topology.\n\nProblem: Prove that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the torus (defined as the quotient space [0,1] × [0,1] with opposite edges identified) without using explicit coordinate maps.\n\nBut the user's own attempt mentions mapping one circle to the identification of AB and CD, and the other to AC and BD. That suggests that each S¹ factor corresponds to one of the two identifications. Since S¹ is itself a quotient of [0,1], then S¹ × S¹ would be the product of two such quotients, which is the same as the quotient of [0,1] × [0,1] by the equivalence relation that identifies (0,y) ~ (1,y) and (x,0) ~ (x,1). Therefore, the product of the two quotient spaces is the same as the quotient of the square with both pairs of sides identified, which is the torus. Therefore, the homeomorphism is almost by definition, but the user wants a more precise argument.\n\nSo, perhaps the key assumption is that S¹ is defined as the quotient of [0,1] with endpoints identified, and then the product S¹ × S¹ inherits the product quotient topology, which is equivalent to the quotient of the square with both pairs of sides identified. Hence, the problem is to show that the product of two quotient spaces (each S¹) is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the square with both identifications.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- S¹ is defined as the quotient space [0,1]/~ where 0 ~ 1.\n- The torus is defined as the quotient space [0,1]×[0,1]/~ where (0,y)~(1,y) and (x,0)~(x,1).\n- The product topology on S¹ × S¹ is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the torus (defined as the quotient space [0,1]×[0,1] with opposite edges identified).\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions a coordinate-free approach. So perhaps they want to avoid using the explicit quotient map from [0,1] to S¹, but instead use properties of quotient spaces and products.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the torus is defined as the embedded surface in R³, and they want to show that it's homeomorphic to S¹ × S¹ without using parametrization (coordinates). But that might be harder, since the embedded torus is defined via coordinates. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the quotient space definition.\n\nIn the user's thought process, they mention constructing the torus by identifying opposite sides of a rectangle, which is the quotient space approach. Then, they think about mapping each circle to the identifications. So, the key is that S¹ is the result of identifying the ends of an interval, and the product of two such circles would correspond to identifying both pairs of sides of the square.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that the product of two quotient spaces (each S¹) is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the square with both pairs of sides identified. That is, ([0,1]/~) × ([0,1]/~) ≅ ([0,1]×[0,1])/≈ where ≈ is the equivalence relation identifying both pairs of opposite sides.\n\nThis is a standard result in topology about products of quotient spaces, but it requires careful handling because the product of quotients isn't always the quotient of the product. However, in this case, since the equivalence relations on each factor are \"independent\", the product quotient is homeomorphic to the quotient of the product.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are about the definitions of S¹ and the torus as specific quotient spaces, and the problem is to establish the homeomorphism between their product and the torus quotient space.\n\nI think that's the core. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nS¹ is the quotient space [0,1]/~ where 0~1,\nThe torus is defined as the quotient space [0,1]×[0,1]/~ with (0,y)~(1,y) and (x,0)~(x,1),\nThe product space S¹ × S¹ is equipped with the product topology.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S¹ × S¹ is homeomorphic to the torus (defined as the quotient space [0,1]×[0,1] with opposite edges identified) using a coordinate-free method.",
