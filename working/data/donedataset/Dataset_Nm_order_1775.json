    "Content": "Prove or disprove : There exists a continuous surjection from $\\mathbb{R}^3- S^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2-\\{(0,0)\\}$ (here $S^2\\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^3$ denotes the unit sphere defined by the equation\n  $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$),. This question had appeared in TIFR GS-2018 exam for PhD admissions. How should I think about such a map?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is such a map : project $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\mathbb{S}_2$ onto $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (projection on the first two coordinates, for instance); apply the exponential map from $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\simeq \\mathbb{C}$ onto $\\mathbb{R}^2  \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\} \\simeq \\mathbb{C}^*$. Both are continuous surjections, so their composition still is. Given the bounty, I think this deserves at least some additional material (or: how may someone find this answer). Let $X$ and $Y$ be two topological spaces. If there is no continuous surjective map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, then $X$ must have some property which is preserved by continuous maps, and which $Y$ doesn't have. It turns out that there are not many such properties. On top of my head, the only general ones I can see are : Cardinality : If Card(X) < Card(Y), then there is no such $f$. Example : $X = \\{0\\}$, $Y = \\{0,1\\}$. Compactness : If $X$ is compact and $Y$ is separable but not compact, then there is no such $f$. Example : $X = [0,1]$, $Y = \\mathbb{R}$. Connectedness : If $X$ is connected and $Y$ isn't, then there is no such $f$. More generally, if $X$ has less (in the sense of cardinality) connected components than $Y$, then there is no such $f$. Example : $X = (0,1)$ and $Y = \\mathbb{Z}$. Although, I am sure, one may find examples with other, less obvious, obstructions. Outside of these, things may get wild. For instance, in all the following cases, there exists a continuous surjective map from $X$ to $Y$: $X = C$, any Cantor set, and $Y$ is any compact metric space . $X=[0,1]$ and $Y = [0,1]^2$ : Peano curve. More generally, $X = \\mathbb{R}$ and $Y = \\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \\geq 1$, using variants of the Peano curve. $X = \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $Y = \\mathbb{R}^n$, with $k \\geq n$, using projections. Combining with he previous example, we get all $k \\geq 1$ and $n \\geq 0$. $X = \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $Y$ is a (separable) connected, $n$-dimensional topological manifold, with $k \\geq 1$. This is not easy to formalize and I have no reference at hand, but the basic idea is to take $k=n$, and make $\\mathbb{R}^n$ a thin tape and wrap it around the manifold (see e.g. this related discussion ). I also think that one may replace $X$ by any non-compact $k$-dimensional manifold. With that, we have the tools to answer the question. First, since $X$ ha dimension $3$ and $Y$ has dimension $2$, we reduce the dimension by projecting. We get the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Then we wrap the plane around the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ ; and we are lucky, since this can be done very explicitly (thanks to the exponential map).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The question is asking whether there exists a continuous surjection from ℝ³ minus the unit sphere S² to ℝ² minus the origin. Hmm, so we need to map points in 3D space (excluding the unit sphere) onto the punctured plane without the origin, in a way that's both continuous and surjective.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some topology concepts. Continuous surjections between spaces often relate to properties like compactness, connectedness, or dimension. Since both spaces here are non-compact—ℝ³ \\ S² and ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}—are both open manifolds. The unit sphere S² is a compact 2-manifold, so removing it from ℝ³ leaves a space that's not compact. Similarly, removing the origin from ℝ² gives a non-compact space. So compactness might not directly help here.\n\nNext, considering dimensions. The domain is 3-dimensional, and the codomain is 2-dimensional. Generally, continuous surjections from higher to lower dimensions can exist, like space-filling curves, but those usually require the domain to be compact (e.g., Peano curve from [0,1] onto [0,1]²). However, here the domain is not compact. But maybe there's a way to construct such a map by some projection or other method.\n\nWait, but we need a continuous surjection. Let's think about projections. The standard projection from ℝ³ to ℝ², like dropping the z-coordinate, is continuous. However, would that map onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}? If we remove S² from ℝ³, does the projection avoid (0,0)? Let's see: The unit sphere S² in ℝ³ consists of points where x² + y² + z² = 1. If we project onto the (x,y)-plane, the image of ℝ³ \\ S² would include all points (x,y) except those where there exists a z such that x² + y² + z² = 1. For a given (x,y), if x² + y² ≤ 1, then there exists a z (specifically z = ±√(1 - x² - y²)) such that the point (x,y,z) is on S². Therefore, the projection of ℝ³ \\ S² would exclude all (x,y) with x² + y² ≤ 1. But we need the codomain to be ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, which includes all points except the origin. However, the projection would miss the entire unit disk in the plane, not just the origin. So that projection isn't surjective onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different projection or mapping. Perhaps a radial projection? If we consider points in ℝ³ \\ S², we might map them to directions in ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. But I'm not sure how to handle that. Alternatively, use the fact that ℝ³ \\ S² has a complicated topology. For instance, it has two connected components: the interior of the sphere (the unit ball) and the exterior. Wait, no. Wait, S² is the unit sphere; removing it from ℝ³ divides the space into two connected components: the open unit ball (where x² + y² + z² < 1) and the exterior (where x² + y² + z² > 1). So ℝ³ \\ S² has two connected components. On the other hand, ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} is connected (it's a punctured plane, which is path-connected). So a continuous image of a disconnected space must be disconnected, but the codomain here is connected. However, that doesn't immediately prevent a continuous surjection because even if the domain is disconnected, you can map both components onto the connected codomain. For example, mapping each component onto the entire codomain. But we need a single continuous function from the entire domain (both components) to the codomain. However, if the function is continuous, the image of each connected component must be connected. So if we map both connected components into ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, which is connected, then the union of their images must be the entire codomain. So maybe each component is mapped onto part of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, and together they cover the whole space.\n\nBut how to construct such a map? Alternatively, perhaps using some kind of quotient map or deformation. Maybe collapse one of the components in some way. Wait, another idea: Since ℝ³ \\ S² is homotopy equivalent to two copies of ℝ³ \\ {ball}, which might not help. Alternatively, think about the fundamental group or higher homotopy groups, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that both spaces are path-connected. Wait, but the domain ℝ³ \\ S² has two path-connected components: the inside and outside of the sphere. So the domain is not path-connected, but the codomain is. So any continuous function's image must be the union of continuous images of each path component. Since each path component is connected, their images must be connected subsets of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. To cover the entire codomain, each image must somehow cover parts of it. But ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} is a single connected space. So maybe we can map each component of the domain onto the entire codomain. For example, if we can find a continuous surjection from each component (the interior and exterior of the sphere) to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, then perhaps combine them into a single function. But how to combine them?\n\nWait, but the two components are separate, so the function would have to agree on the sphere S², but the sphere is removed. So maybe define a function that, on the interior, maps to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} in one way, and on the exterior, maps in another way. For example, for points inside the sphere, project them onto the plane in some surjective way, and for points outside the sphere, project them in another surjective way. But need to ensure continuity across the domain. However, since the two components are separated, continuity is only required within each component. So if we can define a continuous surjection on each component separately, then the combined function would be continuous on the entire domain.\n\nSo, if we can find continuous surjections from the interior of S² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} and from the exterior of S² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, then combining them (e.g., mapping both components via surjections) would give a continuous surjection overall. But is there a continuous surjection from a 3-dimensional space (like the interior of the sphere) to a 2-dimensional space?\n\nYes, for example, projecting onto a plane. But as I thought earlier, the projection of the interior (open unit ball) onto the plane would miss the unit disk. Wait, if we take the interior of the sphere, which is homeomorphic to ℝ³, and project onto ℝ², the image would be the entire plane, but since we're removing S², which includes points where x² + y² + z² =1. Wait, no, the interior of the sphere is points where x² + y² + z² <1. If we project this onto the plane by dropping the z-coordinate, then the image is the set of (x,y) such that x² + y² <1 + z². But z can vary, but since z is bounded (because x² + y² + z² <1), so x² + y² <1 - z². Wait, actually, for each (x,y,z) in the interior, x² + y² <1 - z². Therefore, the projection onto the (x,y)-plane would be the set of (x,y) with x² + y² <1 - z² for some z. But since z can range between -sqrt(1 - x² - y²) and sqrt(1 - x² - y²), the maximum x² + y² can be is less than 1. Wait, no, if x² + y² + z² <1, then x² + y² <1 - z². But z² >=0, so x² + y² <1. Therefore, the projection of the interior of the sphere onto the (x,y)-plane is the open unit disk. So that's not surjective onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\nSimilarly, the exterior of the sphere (points where x² + y² + z² >1) projected onto the (x,y)-plane would give all points where x² + y² >1 - z². But since z can be any real number, for a given (x,y), if x² + y² <=1, then we can choose z such that z² >1 - x² - y², so (x,y,z) is in the exterior. However, if x² + y² >1, then any z would satisfy x² + y² + z² >1. Therefore, the projection of the exterior onto the (x,y)-plane would be all (x,y) except those with x² + y² <=1. Wait, no: For (x,y) with x² + y² <=1, there exists z (sufficiently large) such that (x,y,z) is in the exterior. For (x,y) with x² + y² >1, all z will satisfy x² + y² + z² >1. So the projection of the exterior is actually all of ℝ². But wait, but we need to map to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. So if we project the exterior onto ℝ², we get all points, including (0,0). But since the exterior doesn't include the sphere, which includes the point (0,0, z) where x² + y² + z² =1. Wait, (0,0,1) is on S², so the exterior doesn't include that point, but the projection of the exterior would still include (0,0) because for any (x,y) not equal to (0,0), there's a z such that (x,y,z) is in the exterior. However, for (0,0), there's no z such that (0,0,z) is in the exterior, because (0,0,z) is in the exterior only if z² >1. So the projection of the exterior onto the (x,y)-plane would exclude the origin. Because to have (0,0) in the projection, there must exist a z such that (0,0,z) is in the exterior. But (0,0,z) is in the exterior iff z² >1, so (0,0,z) is in the exterior. Therefore, (0,0) is in the projection of the exterior. Wait, no. The projection of the exterior is the set of all (x,y) such that there exists a z with x² + y² + z² >1. For (0,0), we need a z such that z² >1, which exists (e.g., z=2). So the projection of the exterior includes (0,0). Therefore, projecting the exterior gives all of ℝ², including (0,0), but the codomain is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. So that projection is not suitable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compose the projection with a map that removes the origin. But how? If we take the exterior and project it to ℝ², then map ℝ² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} via some continuous surjection, but ℝ² cannot be continuously surjected onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} because that would require the origin to be in the image, but it's excluded. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a continuous function from ℝ² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, then the image would be ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, but such a function cannot exist because ℝ² is connected and its image under a continuous function must be connected. But ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} is connected, so that's possible. Wait, but can there be a continuous surjection from ℝ² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}? For example, the identity map isn't surjective, but maybe some other map. Hmm, actually, it's a theorem in topology that there is no retraction from ℝ² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, but a retraction is a specific type of continuous surjection. However, there can be non-retractive continuous surjections. For example, consider a map that wraps the plane around the punctured plane somehow. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use a space-filling curve, but those usually map from a lower dimension to higher. Alternatively, think about polar coordinates: map (r,θ) to (r+1, θ), which would shift the origin outwards, but that's a homeomorphism, not a surjection onto the punctured plane. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that both the interior and exterior of S² are homeomorphic to ℝ³ minus a point or something else. Wait, the interior of S² is an open 3-ball, which is homeomorphic to ℝ³. The exterior is also homeomorphic to ℝ³ minus a closed ball, which is homeomorphic to ℝ³ \\ {0} (via inversion: map x to x/||x||² or something). So maybe ℝ³ \\ {0} can be mapped onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. But how?\n\nWait, there's a result in topology that says if there's a continuous surjection from X to Y, then certain topological invariants must be preserved or relate in some way. For example, the existence of such a surjection might require that the dimension of Y is less than or equal to the dimension of X. Since here X is 3-dimensional and Y is 2-dimensional, that's okay. There's a theorem called the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem which deals with continuous images of spaces, but it's about compact spaces. Since our spaces aren't compact, maybe that's not directly applicable.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the fact that ℝ³ \\ S² can be written as the union of two contractible spaces: the interior (a 3-ball) and the exterior (which is also contractible). Wait, the exterior of S² in ℝ³ is actually homeomorphic to ℝ³ minus a closed ball, which is homotopy equivalent to S², right? Because if you take ℝ³ minus a closed ball, you can deformation retract it onto a sphere surrounding the removed ball. So the exterior has the homotopy type of S², while the interior is contractible. So the domain has two components: one contractible, one homotopy equivalent to S². The codomain, ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, is homotopy equivalent to S¹. So homotopy theory might not directly help here, but it's useful to know.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that there's a continuous surjection from ℝ³ to ℝ², such as a projection, but adjust it to avoid mapping to the origin. Wait, but earlier projections didn't work because the image either missed the unit disk or included the origin. Maybe combine the projections from both components. For example, use the interior to cover the unit disk in ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} and the exterior to cover the rest. But how?\n\nSuppose we define a function f: ℝ³ \\ S² → ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} as follows:\n\n- For points inside S² (x² + y² + z² <1), map them to the open unit disk in ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} via projection (x,y,z) ↦ (x,y). But the problem is that the image is the open unit disk, which is a subset of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. To make this surjective, we need to cover the rest of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} with the exterior.\n\n- For points outside S² (x² + y² + z² >1), map them to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} by projecting and then scaling. For example, take (x,y,z) and map to (x,y) scaled by some factor that depends on the distance from the sphere. For instance, if we define f(x,y,z) = (x,y) * (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1). Wait, but then as ||(x,y,z)|| increases, the scaling factor increases, so the image would cover all of ℝ² except maybe the origin. Wait, but for points outside S², ||(x,y,z)|| >1, so sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1 >0. Therefore, f(x,y,z) = (x,y) * (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1). Then, for any (a,b) ≠ (0,0), can we find (x,y,z) outside S² such that (x,y) * (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1) = (a,b)? Let's see. Let’s fix (a,b). We need to solve for (x,y,z) such that:\n\nx = a / (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1)\n\ny = b / (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1)\n\nLet’s denote t = sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1 >0. Then x = a/t, y = b/t. Then z² = (t +1)^2 - x² - y² = (t +1)^2 - (a² + b²)/t².\n\nThis gives z² = t² + 2t +1 - (a² + b²)/t².\n\nWe need z² to be non-negative, so t² + 2t +1 - (a² + b²)/t² ≥0.\n\nMultiply through by t² (since t >0):\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 + t² - (a² + b²) ≥0.\n\nThis is a quartic equation in t. For given a and b, there exists a t >0 satisfying this inequality. For example, as t approaches infinity, the left side approaches infinity, so for sufficiently large t, the inequality holds. Therefore, for any (a,b) ≠ (0,0), there exists a t >0 such that this inequality holds, and thus there exists (x,y,z) in the exterior of S² mapping to (a,b). Therefore, this map from the exterior is a continuous surjection onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\nMeanwhile, for the interior points, if we just project them to the open unit disk, then their image is the open unit disk. But the codomain is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, which includes points outside the unit disk. So the interior projection only covers part of the codomain. However, the exterior map already covers the entire codomain. Therefore, if we define the function as follows:\n\nf(x,y,z) = {\n    (x,y) * (sqrt(x² + y² + z²) -1) if x² + y² + z² >1,\n    (x,y) if x² + y² + z² <1\n}\n\nBut wait, this would map the interior to the open unit disk, and the exterior to the rest of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. However, the images from the exterior already cover everything except possibly the unit circle. Wait, no, because for points in the exterior, when you scale by (sqrt(...) -1), the image can include all points except the origin. Wait, earlier analysis showed that for any (a,b) ≠ (0,0), there's a t >0 such that (a/t, b/t, z) maps to (a,b). Therefore, the exterior map covers all of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. Therefore, if we just use the exterior map, that's already a continuous surjection. But then why use both components? Because the problem allows us to use the entire domain ℝ³ \\ S². But if the exterior alone suffices to cover the codomain, then we can just restrict the function to the exterior. However, the problem asks for a continuous surjection from the entire ℝ³ \\ S². But if the exterior's map already covers the codomain, then we can define the function to be the exterior map on the exterior and anything on the interior, as long as it's continuous. However, the function must be continuous on the entire domain, which includes both the interior and exterior. If we define f differently on the interior and exterior, we have to ensure that there's no discontinuity at the boundary (S²), but since S² is removed, the function is defined on two separate components. Therefore, continuity on each component is sufficient; there's no requirement for the function to \"agree\" across the removed sphere. Therefore, we can define f to map the exterior continuously onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)} and map the interior to, say, the unit disk (which is a subset of the codomain). However, to make the entire function surjective, the images from both components must cover the entire codomain. But the exterior already covers the entire codomain, so the interior mapping is redundant. Therefore, even if we map the interior to a subset, as long as the exterior covers everything, the entire function is surjective. But we need to ensure the function is continuous on the entire domain. Since the domain has two components, we can define f separately on each component. So, for example, define f(x,y,z) = projection from the exterior as before, and define f(x,y,z) = something on the interior. But since the exterior already covers everything, the interior can be mapped to anything, but to ensure surjectivity, it's redundant. However, we must have continuity on each component. The exterior map is continuous, and the interior map (projection) is continuous. But since the codomain is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, which includes the unit disk, mapping the interior via (x,y,z) ↦ (x,y) gives the open unit disk. But the codomain is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, which includes the entire plane except the origin. So the exterior map covers everything except the origin, but the origin is not in the codomain. Wait, no. The codomain is ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, so the origin is excluded. Therefore, the exterior map, which we've argued covers all of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, suffices. Therefore, even if the interior is mapped to the unit disk, which is a subset of the codomain, the exterior already covers everything. Therefore, the combined function is still surjective.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to have a continuous surjection from the entire ℝ³ \\ S² to ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. So if we can define a function that on the exterior covers the entire codomain, and on the interior maps into the codomain without disrupting surjectivity, then it's acceptable. Since the exterior already covers everything, the interior can be mapped anywhere, but it must not introduce discontinuities. However, since the interior and exterior are separate components, we can define the function piecewise.\n\nTherefore, one possible construction is:\n\n- For points outside S² (exterior), use the map f(x,y,z) = (x,y) scaled by (||(x,y,z)|| -1), which we argued is a continuous surjection onto ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}.\n\n- For points inside S² (interior), map them to any continuous path in ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, for example, map them all to a single point. However, if we do that, the function would not be surjective unless that point is the only one covered by the interior. But since the exterior already covers everything, even if the interior maps to a single point, the function is still surjective as long as that point is in the codomain. But we need the entire codomain to be covered. If the exterior covers everything, then yes. However, mapping the interior to a single point is continuous, and the exterior covers the rest. So overall, the function is continuous and surjective.\n\nHowever, the problem is to find a continuous surjection. The above approach would work if we define f on the exterior as the scaled projection and on the interior as any continuous map into ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}. But to ensure surjectivity, the exterior must already cover the entire codomain. Since we've established that the exterior's map covers all of ℝ² \\ {(0,0)}, then yes. Therefore, such a function exists.\n\nBut wait, let's verify continuity. The function is defined piecewise on two open sets (interior and exterior), and on each piece, it's continuous. Therefore, the overall function is continuous. Therefore, this construction works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that such a continuous surjection exists. Therefore, the problem is to prove that there exists such a map. So the formatted problem would list the assumptions and the problem.",
