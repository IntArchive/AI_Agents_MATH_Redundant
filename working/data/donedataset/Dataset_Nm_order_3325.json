    "Content": "I am looking at Exercise 5.2 (page 44) in \"Real Analysis for Graduate Students\" by Richard Bass. Let $f:(0, 1)\\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that for every $x\\in (0, 1)$,\n  there exist $r>0$ and a Borel measurable function $g$, both depending\n  on $x$, such that $f$ and $g$ agree on $(x-r, x+r)\\cap (0, 1)$. Prove\n  that $f$ is Borel measurable. Attempt. For each $x\\in (0, 1)$, let's denote $r_{x}$ and $g_{x}$ to be the quantities given in the problem statement. By choosing $r_x$ sufficiently small, we may assume that $(x-r_{x}, x+r_{x})\\subseteq (0, 1)$. Then for $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we have\n$$\nf^{-1}((a, \\infty))=\\{y: f(y)>a\\}=\\bigcup_{x\\in (0, 1)} \\{y: g_{x}(y)>a\\}\\cap (x-r_{x}, x+r_{x})\n$$\nSince $g_{x}$ is Borel measurable, we know that $\\{y: g_{x}(y)>a\\}\\cap (x-r_{x}, x+r_{x})$ is a Borel set. But the union above is uncountable; so how do we show that $f^{-1}((a, \\infty))$ is a Borel set? Attempt 2. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and dense in $(0, 1)$, we can try looking at the points $x\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\cap (0, 1)$. But then the intervals $(x-r_{x}, x+r_{x})$ need not cover $(0, 1)$. The standard example is as follows. Suppose $\\{q_1, q_2, …\\}$ is enumeration of rationals in $(0, 1)$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$. If we let $r_{q_{j}}$ to be $\\varepsilon 2^{-j}$, then the measure of $\\bigcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} (q_j-r_{q_{j}}, q_{j}+r_{q_{j}})$ is at most $2\\varepsilon$. Attempt 3. If each $g_{x}$ is continuous, we would be done. In that case, $$\\{y: g_{x}(y)>a\\}\\cap (x-r_{x}, x+r_{x})$$ would be an open set; so as a union of open sets, $f^{-1}((a, \\infty))$ would be an open set, and hence Borel.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "By hypothesis, for every $x\\in (0, 1)$ we find Borel measurable function $g_{x}$ and $r_x>0$ such that $f=g_{x}$ on the open interval $(x-r_x, x+r_x)\\subset (0, 1)$. This gives an open cover of $(0, 1)$:\n$$\n(0, 1) = \\bigcup_{x\\in (0, 1)} (x-r_{x}, x+r_x)\n$$\nSince $(0, 1)$ is a Lindelöf space, this open cover has a countable subcover, i.e. we can find $x_1, x_2, x_3, …$ in $(0, 1)$ such that\n$$\n(0, 1)=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} (x_{n}-r_{x_{n}}, x+r_{x_{n}})\n$$ \nNow for any $a>0$, we have that\n$$\nf^{-1}((a, \\infty))=\\{y: f(y)>a\\}=\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{y: g_{x_n}(y)>a\\}\\cap (x_n-r_{x_{n}}, x_n+r_{x_{n}})\n$$\nEach $\\{y: g_{x_n}(y)>a\\}\\cap (x_n-r_{x_{n}}, x_n+r_{x_{n}})$ is a Borel measurable set. As a countable union of measurable sets, $f^{-1}((a, \\infty))$ is measurable. Thus, $f$ is Borel measurable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example given shows how assumptions are listed and then the problem is stated. \n\nLooking at the original problem here: The task is to prove that a function f defined on (0,1) is Borel measurable, given that for every x in (0,1), there exists r>0 and a Borel measurable function g (both depending on x) such that f and g agree on the interval around x intersected with (0,1). \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that for every x in (0,1), there's a radius r (depending on x) and a Borel measurable function g (also depending on x) such that f equals g on the neighborhood around x. So each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n1. The domain of f is (0,1), so f is defined from (0,1) to R.\n2. For every x in (0,1), there exists r>0 (depending on x).\n3. For every x in (0,1), there exists a Borel measurable function g (depending on x).\n4. f and g agree on the intersection of (x - r, x + r) with (0,1).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that f is Borel measurable. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions that \"both depending on x\", so that's covered in points 2 and 3. The key conditions here are the local agreement with Borel measurable functions around each point. The user in the example didn't include all the problem's context but focused on the essential assumptions. The example given by the user had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", each on their own line. So here, each condition related to the existence of r, the Borel measurable g, and their agreement on the interval.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one condition. Let me check again:\n\n1. f is a function from (0,1) to R. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n2. For every x in (0,1), there exists r > 0 dependent on x. (Since r depends on x.)\n3. For every x in (0,1), there exists a Borel measurable function g_x (dependent on x). (Each x has its own g.)\n4. f and g_x agree on (x - r_x, x + r_x) intersected with (0,1). (So locally f equals a Borel measurable function.)\n\nThese are the four assumptions. The problem is to prove f is Borel measurable.\n\nThe original problem's title mentions that Borel measurability is a local property, which is what the user is trying to prove. The user's own attempts are part of the question but don't affect the assumptions. The key is to extract the given conditions from the problem statement, not the attempts.\n\nSo, structured as per the example, the assumptions would list each condition separately, and the problem is the main statement to prove.",
