    "Content": "I have just begun to read Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry . In the first section of the first chapter, he quotes Lüroth's theorem, which states that any subfield of $k(x)$ that is not just $k$ is isomorphic to $k(x)$, i.e. is generated as a field over $k$ by a single rational function of $x$. I have been trying to find a proof. I am stuck, and would appreciate any hints to fill in the argument. (I have consulted Wikipedia, Wolfram Mathworld, and this MathOverflow question , but so far haven't been able to satisfy myself.) I have thought about two approaches so far. My question would be answered by a suggestion about how to complete either one of these ideas. Here they are: Let $k\\subset L \\subset k(x)$ be an intermediate field not equal to $k$. Approach #1: Any element of $k(x)$ not in $k$ is transcendental over $k$; meanwhile, $k(x)$ has transcendence degree 1 over $k$; it follows that $L$ has transcendence degree 1 over $k$. Thus $k(x)$ is algebraic over $L$. Let $p(t)$ be the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $L$. $$p(t)=t^n+l_1t^{n-1}+\\dots+l_n$$ where $l_1,\\dots,l_n\\in L$ (and are thus rational functions of $x$). Now if the theorem is really true, $L=k(f)$ for some $f\\in k(x)$; and $f=r/s$, with $r,s\\in k[x]$. Then $p(t)=r(t)-fs(t)$. This is degree $n=\\max(\\deg r,\\deg s)$ in $t$. Any coefficient of any power of $t$ in $p(t)$ is actually either in $k$ (if this power of $t$ does not appear in $s$), or else it is a linear function of $f$ and thus a field generator for $L$ and degree $n$ as a rational function of $x$. Thus I expect to be able to prove that, with $p(t)$ defined as above, actually any of the coefficients $l_1,\\dots,l_n$ not contained in $k$, i.e. any of them (say $l_i$) that is a nonconstant function of $x$, is degree $n$ as a function of $x$ and is thus a field generator for $L$. (It would be sufficient to prove that it is degree $n$ as a function of $x$, because then $k(x)\\supset L \\supset k(l_i)$, but $[k(x):L]=[k(x):k(l_i)]=n$.) One internet source I found suggested that this is the right approach, but I can't seem to fill it in. Here's what I've got: $p(t)$ is divisible by $t-x$ over $k(x)$ (since $x$ is a root), and over $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)$ it is irreducible (since this field is contained in $L$). I can't see that there is anything else I know about it for sure. It must be that irreducibility over $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)$ implies that $l_1,\\dots,l_n$ are all either degree $n$ or else in $k$; but I haven't figured out how. From examples I have worked out (in which I chose $l_1,\\dots,l_n$ semi-arbitrarily to fulfill $(t-x)\\mid p(t)$), this seems to be true; if I make any of them different in degree from $0$ or $n$, then usually I can also get $x$ as a rational function of them, thus in these examples $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)=k(x)$ and $p(t)$ is divisible by $t-x$ over $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)$. Of course I assume it can also happen that I choose $l_1,\\dots,l_n$ so that $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)\\neq k(x)$, but $p(x)$ will still factor over $k(l_1,\\dots,l_n)$ as long as any of the $l_i$ not in $k$ differ in degree from $n$. In any case all the calculations have felt ad-hoc and I haven't so far seen a reason for what is happening. So any hints here would be appreciated. Approach #2: Because the theorem reminds me of the result that $k[x]$ is a p.i.d., I have also been unable to escape the following thought: let $f\\in L$ be an element of $L$ of minimal degree as a function of $x$, and suppose that there is some other element $g\\in L$ not in $k(f)$. Can I construct some element of $L$ using $f$ and $g$ (i.e. an element of $k(f,g)$) that contradicts $f$'s minimality in degree? I have not given this approach as much thought as the above, but again, so far I have not seen how to carry out the construction. The Euclidean-algorithm trick that proves $k[x]$ is a p.i.d. is unavailable here because I can't multiply $f$ or $g$ by anything that is not a rational function of one or the other of them. (In particular I can't see how to pass to a polynomial ring in $x$ but make sure I've stayed inside $k(f,g)$.) $g$ does have a minimal polynomial over $k(f)$, and if $g\\notin k(f)$ then its degree is $>1$, so this could be a starting point for trying to construct the lower-degree element of $k(f,g)$, but again I haven't seen how to make this work. So here again, I would appreciate any thought that could be used to complete the argument. Thanks in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think that Bergman's suggested approach (from his handout in postscript ) follows along the lines of your first approach, though perhaps organized a bit differently. (For the benefit of those lacking a Postscript reader) Preliminaries: Every element of $k(x)[t]$ can be written as\n$$\\frac{P(x,t)}{Q(x)}$$\nwhere $P(x,t)$ and $Q(x)$ are relatively prime in the UFD $k(x)[t]$, and $Q$ is monic in $x$. Given such an expression for an element of $k(x)[t]$, define its height to be the maximum of the degree of $P$ in $x$ and the degree of $Q$ in $x$. This also applies to elements of $k(x)$. If $u=P(x,t)/Q(x)$ is monic in $t$ (viewed as an element of $k(x)[t]$, then the height of $u$ equals the degree of $P$, and $P$ is not divisible by any nonunit element of $k[x]$. If $f,g\\in k(x)[t]$ are both monic as polynomials in $t$, then $\\mathrm{height}(fg) = \\mathrm{height}(f)+\\mathrm{height}(g)$. If $u\\in k(x)$, $u\\notin k$, then there exists $u'\\in k(x)$, such that $\\mathrm{height}(u')=\\mathrm{height}(u)$, with $k(u)=k(u')$, and such that when we write $u'=P'(t)/Q'(t)$, $P'$ and $Q'$ coprime, we will have $\\deg(P')\\gt \\deg(Q')$, and both are monic. In fact, $u'$ can be taken of the form $\\alpha u$ or $\\alpha/(u-\\beta)$, $\\alpha,\\beta\\in k$. If $u\\in k(x)-k$, $u=P(x)/Q(x)$, then $x$ is a root of $P(t)-uQ(t)\\in k(u)[t]$. If $\\deg_x(P)\\gt \\deg_x(Q)$ and $P$ is monic, then the polynomial $P(t)-uQ(t)$ is monic. Argument. Let $L$, $k\\subseteq L\\subseteq k(x)$, and pick $u\\in L-k$, $u=P(x)/Q(x)$, that minimizes the height; let $\\mathrm{height}(u)=n$. Show $P(t)-uQ(t)$ is either irreducible over $L$, or divisible by a nonunit element of $k[t]$ in $L[t]$. Show that if $P(t)-uQ(t)$ is divisible by a nonunit element of $k[t]$ in $L[t]$, then the element divides both $P(t)$ and $Q(t)$. Conclude that $P(t)-uQ(t)$ is the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $L$. Show that $P(t)-uQ(t)$ is the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $k(u)\\subseteq L$, and conclude that $L=k(u)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about Lüroth's Theorem. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the Math Stack Exchange question provided.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the question carefully. The user mentions that they are trying to prove Lüroth's Theorem, which states that any subfield of k(x) not equal to k is isomorphic to k(x), meaning it's generated by a single rational function. They have tried two approaches but are stuck.\n\nLooking for assumptions, the theorem applies to a subfield L of k(x) where k is a field. The key conditions here are that L is an intermediate field between k and k(x), and L is not equal to k. The problem is to prove that such a subfield L must be isomorphic to k(x), i.e., generated by a single element.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that k is a field, L is a subfield of k(x), L contains k, and L is not equal to k. Each of these should be separate points in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that L is isomorphic to k(x), which means L is generated by a single rational function over k.\n\nI need to check the example provided. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the field extensions.\n\nLet me structure that:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nL is a subfield of k(x),\nk is a subfield of L,\nL is not equal to k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L is isomorphic to k(x), i.e., generated over k by a single rational function.\n\nWait, the original theorem states that any subfield of k(x) not equal to k is isomorphic to k(x). So the problem is to prove that under the given assumptions, L is isomorphic to k(x). The user's question is about proving this theorem.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a field,\nL is a subfield of k(x),\nk is contained in L,\nL is not equal to k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that L is isomorphic to k(x).\n\nYes, that seems right. The user's own approaches mention that L is an intermediate field not equal to k, so the assumptions align with that. Each condition is separate and applied to the relevant objects (k, L).\n\nI think that's it. Let me check again the example. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Here, four assumptions, each a single condition. The problem statement matches the theorem's conclusion.",
