    "Content": "My question is in fact the exercise 1.8 page 8 in Algebraic Geometry by Robin Hartshone. Let $Y$ be an affine variety of dimension $r$ in $\\mathbb{A}^n$ . Let $H$ be a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}^n$ and assume that $Y\\nsubseteq H$ . Then prove that every irrducible component of $Y\\cap H$ has dimension $r-1$ Here is my idea to prove : Suppose that $Y\\cap H =\\cup U_i$ then $I(Y\\cap H)=I(\\cup U_{i})$ . It is not hard to check that $f \\in I(Y\\cap H)$ then $(f)\\subseteq I(U_{i})$ for each $i$ . Since $U_i$ is irreducible then $I(U_{i})$ is a prime ideal. Then if $I(U_i)$ is minimal over $(f)$ then we can use Krull Principal Ideal Theorem to prove that ht $I(U_i)=1$ , then dim $U_i=r-1$ I have two question : Is my strategy wrong ? If I am on the right way, how can I show that $I(U_{i})$ is minimal over $(f)$ ? Thank for reading my question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f$ be a regular function defining the hypersurface $H$ and suppose the $U_i$ are the irreducible components of $Y\\cap H$ (otherwise the result is not true). If $I(U_i)$ is not minimal over $(f)$, it contains strictly a prime ideal $J\\ni f$. So $U_i\\subsetneq Z(J) \\subseteq Z(f)=H$. As $Z(J)$ is irreducible, this contradicts the hypothesis that $U_i$ is an irreducible component of $H\\cap Y$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original problem is from Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, Exercise I.1.8.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the problem. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So I should parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem states: Let Y be an affine variety of dimension r in 𝔸ⁿ. Let H be a hypersurface in 𝔸ⁿ, and assume that Y is not contained in H. Then prove that every irreducible component of Y∩H has dimension r−1.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. Y is an affine variety.\n2. Y has dimension r.\n3. Y is in (embedded in) 𝔸ⁿ.\n4. H is a hypersurface in 𝔸ⁿ.\n5. Y is not contained in H (Y ⊈ H).\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to Y or H. For example, \"Y is an affine variety\" is one assumption, \"Y has dimension r\" another, etc. The problem then is to prove the statement about the dimension of the irreducible components of the intersection.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem mentions \"every irreducible component of Y∩H\", so it's assuming that Y∩H has irreducible components, which follows from the fact that algebraic sets are Noetherian, hence have a decomposition into irreducible components. But maybe that's part of the general theory and not an assumption the user needs to list. The key assumptions given explicitly are the ones about Y, H, and their relation.\n\nThe original question also includes the user's approach and their two questions about their strategy. But when formatting the problem according to the user's instructions, we should filter out the user's own thoughts and focus only on the problem as presented in the exercise. The example provided by the user only included the problem's assumptions and the problem statement, excluding the user's own attempt or additional questions. So in this case, the formatted problem should list the assumptions from the exercise itself, not the user's added questions about their strategy.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should include the five points I listed above, each as a separate line. The Problem section will be the main statement to prove: that every irreducible component of Y∩H has dimension r−1.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". The user in the example added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but maybe that was part of a modified problem? Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error because the original problem didn't state that. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the example given by the user says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. But maybe the example was from a different problem where such an assumption was made. Regardless, in the current problem, we need to strictly follow the problem as stated by Hartshorne.\n\nSo, sticking to the problem from Hartshorne:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Y is an affine variety.\n2. Y has dimension r.\n3. Y is contained in 𝔸ⁿ.\n4. H is a hypersurface in 𝔸ⁿ.\n5. Y is not contained in H.\n\nProblem: Prove that every irreducible component of Y∩H has dimension r−1.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line, addressing one property. So that's five assumptions. The problem statement is as given.\n\nThe original question from Math Stack Exchange includes the user's own approach and their questions about their strategy, but according to the user's instructions, we need to filter out unrelated information. The user's own strategy and their two questions are part of their thought process but not part of the original problem's assumptions or statement. So those should be excluded when structuring the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those five assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
