    "Content": "I'm taking classes in homological algebra now, and the book (together with the lecturer) seem to assume more category theory than I already know. A \"fact\" that is used freely in the book (\"Homological algebra\" by Weibel, by the way), is that every abelian group is (isomorphic to) the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups . However, I do not find this particularly obvious. How does one go about prove such things?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The fact that a  group is the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups is true for any group, not just abelian ones. Remember what the direct limit of groups is. You start with a directed set $I$ (directed means that it is a partially ordered set, and if $i,j\\in I$, then there exists $k\\in I$ such that $i\\leq k$ and $j\\leq k$). For each $i\\in I$, you have a group $H_i$, and if $i\\leq k$, then you have a morphism $f_{ik}\\colon H_i\\to H_k$. The system $\\{H_i, f_{ij}\\}_{i\\in I}$ must also satisfy: $f_{ii} = \\mathrm{id}_{H_i}$ for each $i\\in I$; and If $i\\leq j\\leq k$, then $f_{ik} = f_{jk}\\circ f_{ij}$. The direct limit is then constructed as follows: we let $X$ be the disjoint union of the sets $H_i\\times\\{i\\}$, and we define the equivalence relation $\\sim$ on $X$ as follows: given $(h,i)$ and $(h',j)$, we let $(h,i)\\sim (h',j)$ if and only if there exists $k\\in I$ such that $i\\leq k$, $j\\leq k$, and $f_{ik}(h) = f_{jk}(h')$. We then define a group operation on $X/\\sim$ as follows: given $[(h,i)]$ and $[(h',j)]$ in $X$, let $k\\in I$ such that $i\\leq k$ and $j\\leq k$. We define $$[(h,i)][(h',j)] = [(f_{ik}(h)f_{jk}(h'),k)].$$\nNote that this makes sense, since $f_{ik}(h)$ and $f_{jk}(h)$ are both in $H_k$. It is then an exercise to show that this gives you a group with the appropriate universal property. Intuition. The idea is just that two elements in $X$ are \"equal\" if and only if they \"eventually\" map to the same thing.  And we define the product by first mapping both elements sufficiently \"ahead\" that they both lie in the same group, and then multiply them. The direct limit is then a way of \"gluing\" all of $H_i$ in a compatible way. The reason we expect the direct limit of the finitely generated subgroups to \"be\" the group (that is, isomorphic to the group) is that any particular operation we want to do with group elements always occurs in a finitely generated subgroup: if you are performing an operation inside the group, the operation uses only finitely many elements, so it all happens inside a finitely generated group. Thus, everything that \"determines\" what the group is is captured if you look at all finitely generated subgroups: to know how to multiply $x$ by $y$, you can multiply them in the finitely generated subgroup $\\langle x,y\\rangle$, after all. The direct limit is just a way of putting together all of these subgroups which we should be able to do since they are all \"really\" already glued together inside of $G$. Sketch of proof. Now, let $G$ be a group. Let $I$ be the collection of all finitely generated subgroups of $G$, and order $I$ by inclusion of subgroups. For each element $i\\in I$, let $H_i$ be the subgroup $i$ itself (remember that $i$ is a subgroup of $G$ by definition of $I$). If $i\\leq j$, then $i\\subseteq j$ as sets, so we let $f_{ij}\\colon H_i \\to H_j$ be the inclusion map. Note that if $i=j$, then $f_{ii} = \\mathrm{id}_{H_i}$, as required, and if $i\\leq j\\leq k$, then $H_i\\subseteq H_j\\subseteq H_k$, and the inclusion $H_i\\hookrightarrow H_k$ is the composition of the inclusion $H_i\\hookrightarrow H_j$ and $H_J\\hookrightarrow H_k$. So $\\{H_i,f_{ij}\\}_{i\\in I}$ is a directed system of groups. Let $H$ be the direct limit, and let $f_i\\colon H_i\\to H$ be the structure maps into the direct limit. The structure maps are one-to-one, because $[(h,i)] = [(e,j)]$ if and only if there exists $k\\geq i$ such that $f_{ik}(h) = e$, but all our $f_{ik}$ are one-to-one. To see that the direct limit is (isomorphic to) a subgroup of $G$, note that you have embeddings $\\varphi_i\\colon H_i\\hookrightarrow G$ from $H_i$ to $G$ for each $i$, and this embeddings commute with the structure maps $f_{ij}$. This means that by the universal property there is a homomorphism $\\phi\\colon H \\to G$ such that $\\varphi_i = \\phi\\circ f_i$ for all $i$. In particular, $\\phi$ is an embedding, so $H$ is (isomorphic to) a subgroup of $G$. To see that the map is onto, let $g\\in G$. Then letting $i=\\langle g\\rangle$, we have that $g$ is in the image of $\\varphi_i$, hence in the image of $\\phi$. Thus, $\\phi$ is an isomorphism. Added. The same argument holds for any collection $\\mathcal{C}$ of subgroups of $G$ such that (i) every element of $G$ lies in at least one subgroup in $\\mathcal{C}$; (ii) given any two subgroups $H$ and $K$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, there is a subgroup $M$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ that contains both $H$ and $K$.  So it works for $\\mathcal{C}$ being \"all finitely generated subgroups\"; \"all subgroups\"; for infinite cardinal $\\kappa$, \"all subgroups of cardinality less than or equal to $\\kappa$\"; and other classes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. The original question is about proving that every abelian group is the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem is about abelian groups, so the main object here is an abelian group. The key assumptions or conditions would relate to properties of the group and the direct limit construction.\n\nLooking at the question, the main points are:\n1. The group is abelian.\n2. The group is the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups.\n3. The problem is to prove this statement.\n\nWait, the problem isn't stating any additional conditions like being finitely generated or having certain properties. The claim is that every abelian group satisfies this. So the assumptions are just that the group is abelian. But maybe I need to check if there's any implicit conditions. The original problem mentions \"every abelian group,\" so the only assumption is that we're dealing with an abelian group. The fact that the direct limit is over its finitely generated subgroups is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nSo, the assumption here is simply that the group is abelian. The problem is to show that this group is isomorphic to the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups.\n\nWait, but sometimes in category theory, direct limits (or colimits) require certain conditions. But the problem states it as a general fact for any abelian group. So the assumption is the group is abelian. The problem is to prove it's the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one property applied to one object. Here, the object is the group, and the property is being abelian. That's the only assumption. The rest is part of the problem statement. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the assumption is the group is abelian, and the problem is about the direct limit.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- The group is abelian.\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that the group is isomorphic to the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups.\n\nWait, but the original question states \"every abelian group is the direct limit of its finitely generated subgroups\". So maybe the problem is to prove that statement. Therefore, the assumption is the group is abelian, and the problem is to show it's the direct limit of its f.g. subgroups.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any other assumptions. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, but here only one assumption: the group is abelian. So the formatted answer should list that assumption and then state the problem as proving the direct limit property.",
