    "AcceptedAnswer": "first of all we know that $$\\det(A \\cdot  B)=\\det(A)\\times\\det(B)$$ also we know that $$A\\times A^{-1}=I$$ we know that $$\\det(A \\cdot A^{-1})=\\det(I)$$ or $$\\det(A)\\times\\det(A^{-1})=\\det(I)$$ Can you continue from this? Ask yourself: what is $\\det(I)$?) Take the example of the $3\\times 3$ identity matrix: $$ I =  \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$ $$ \\det(I) = 1$$ So, $$\\det(A)\\times\\det(A^{-1})=1$$ or $$\\boxed{\\det(A^{-1})=\\frac{1}{\\det(A)}}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that the determinant of the inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of the determinant of the matrix. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that A is a non-singular matrix. Non-singular means that the matrix is invertible, so that's one assumption. Also, since we're dealing with determinants, the matrix must be square because determinants are only defined for square matrices. Even though the original question didn't explicitly mention that A is square, it's implied because only square matrices can be invertible (non-singular). So I should list both assumptions: A is a square matrix and A is non-singular.\n\nNext, the problem statement itself is straightforward: prove that det(A⁻¹) equals 1/det(A). The user's example included assumptions on separate lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. So I'll list each assumption separately.\n\nWait, does the non-singularity automatically imply that the matrix is square? Yes, because only square matrices can have inverses. So maybe the first assumption is redundant? But sometimes people might not remember that, so to be thorough, it's better to state both. The problem says \"non-singular matrix A\", so the key assumptions are that A is square and invertible. Even though invertible matrices are by definition square, maybe the user wants both listed for clarity. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- A is a square matrix.\n- A is non-singular (invertible).\n\nThen the problem is to prove det(A⁻¹) = 1/det(A). \n\nI should check the example again. In the example, the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example was modified? Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error because the original problem is for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an extra condition. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Or perhaps it's a different problem. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem where the user had to filter out assumptions. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7? That seems confusing. But regardless, the user wants me to follow the format where assumptions are listed, each on one line, each addressing one property.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are that A is a square matrix and non-singular. Therefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions. The problem then is to prove the determinant relationship.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't state that A is square. But in linear algebra, only square matrices can be invertible. So maybe the assumption that A is square is implicit in the term \"non-singular matrix\". However, the user's example includes assumptions that may not all have been explicitly stated. For example, in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but it's included in the assumptions. That suggests that maybe the user wants to extract all necessary conditions, even if they are implied. But in the case of the current problem, the question is about A⁻¹, which requires A to be square and invertible. So the two assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a square matrix.\n2. A is non-singular (i.e., invertible).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
