    "Content": "Show that the sequence defined as $$x_n = \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)+\\sin\\left(\\frac{2}{n^2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\sin\\left(\\frac{n}{n^2}\\right)$$ converges to $\\frac{1}{2}$ . My attempt was to evaluate this limit by using squeeze theorem. I managed to show that $x_n < \\frac{n+1}{2n}$ by using $\\sin(x) < x$ , but I haven't been able to find a sequence smaller than $x_n$ that also converges to $\\frac{1}{2}$ . I tried showing by induction that $x_n > \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{n}$ , but I got nowhere with that. Any help would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Start with $x-x^3/6<\\sin(x)<x$ ; there are many nice proofs here . Then we have $$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(k/n^2)-(k/n^2)^3/6 <\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sin(k/n^2) < \\sum_{k=1}^{n}k/n^2\n$$ Using the fact that $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^p = \\frac{n^{p+1}}{p+1}+\\text{ lower order terms}$ , we have $$\n\\frac{n^2+\\cdots}{2 n^2}- \\frac{n^4+\\cdots}{24 n^6} <\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sin(k/n^2)  < \\frac{n^2+\\cdots}{2 n^2},\n$$ and the result follows by squeezing. We can actually do a bit better with the sums using closed-form identites : $$\n\\frac{n^2+n}{2 n^2}- \\frac{n^4+2n^3+n^2}{24 n^6} <\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\sin(k/n^2)  < \\frac{n^2+n}{2 n^2}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to show that the limit of the sum x_n, which is the sum from k=1 to n of sin(k/n²), as n approaches infinity is 1/2. The user tried using the squeeze theorem. They found an upper bound using sin(x) < x, which gave them (n+1)/(2n), which approaches 1/2. But they need a lower bound that also approaches 1/2.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The assumptions should list each condition. The original problem mentions that n goes to infinity, so the sequence is defined for positive integers n. The problem is about the convergence of the sum. Let me parse the problem statement again.\n\nThe user's problem statement is: Show that the limit of x_n = sin(1/n²) + sin(2/n²) + ... + sin(n/n²) as n approaches +infty is 1/2. The user's attempt involved the squeeze theorem, using sin(x) < x for the upper bound, leading to x_n < (n+1)/(2n) which tends to 1/2. They need a lower bound that also approaches 1/2.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- Each term in the sum is sin(k/n²) for k from 1 to n.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches positive infinity.\n- The problem is to show convergence to 1/2.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, n is a positive integer going to infinity, but maybe the problem doesn't state any specific divisibility. The key conditions here are that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, and the sum is up to k=n. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n- The sum is from k=1 to n of sin(k/n²).\n\nBut the example's assumption was listing properties applied to one object. Let me check the example again. The example's assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition on a single object.\n\nIn this problem, the problem is about the sequence x_n defined for each n (positive integer), and the limit as n approaches infinity. So the main assumptions would be:\n\n- For each positive integer n, the sequence x_n is defined as the sum from k=1 to n of sin(k/n²).\n- The problem considers the limit of x_n as n approaches infinity.\n\nSo translating that into the assumption lines:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nx_n is the sum from k=1 to n of sin(k/n²),\nthe limit is taken as n approaches positive infinity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{n \\to +\\infty} x_n = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title and question both state the same problem. The user's attempt mentions using the squeeze theorem with upper bound (n+1)/(2n) which approaches 1/2. They need a lower bound. The problem is about the convergence, so the key elements are the definition of x_n as the sum of sin(k/n²) from k=1 to n, and the limit as n→infty being 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture these elements. The assumptions are the conditions under which the problem is posed. So n is a positive integer, the sum is defined as such, and the limit is as n approaches infinity. The problem is to show that the limit equals 1/2.\n\nI think that's all. The user didn't mention any other conditions, like specific constraints on n beyond being a positive integer. So the assumptions are straightforward.",
