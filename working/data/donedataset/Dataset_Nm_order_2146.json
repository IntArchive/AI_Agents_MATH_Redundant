Here's what I've already tried. (1) From $\\mu\\ll\\nu\\ll\\eta$ it follows $\\mu\\ll\\eta$ and from this by Radon-Nikodým, that it exists a density $\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\eta}$ of $\\mu$ relating to $\\eta$, that is $\\eta-\\text{ a.s.}$ unique. Moreover, there is a second density of $\\mu$ relating to $\\eta$, getting by using $\\mu\\ll\\nu$ and $\\nu\\ll\\eta$ and again Radon-Nikodým: It exists a density $\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}$, that is $\\nu-\\text{ a.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\\mu=\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\nu$. Similarly, there exists a density $\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\eta}$, that is $\\eta-\\text{ f.s.}$ unique and for which it is $\\nu=\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\eta}\\eta$. Putting this together, it is $$\n\\mu=\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\nu=\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\eta}\\eta.\n$$ So another density of $\\mu$ relating to $\\eta$ is found.\nBut because, as said, by Radon-Nikodým the densitiy of $\\mu$ relating to $\\eta$ (named above $\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\eta}$) is $\\eta-\\text{ a.s.}$ unique, it follows $$ \n\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\eta}=\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\eta}~\\eta-\\text{ a.s.}\n$$ (2) From $\\mu\\sim\\nu$ it follows by Radon-Nikodým: $\\mu=\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\nu$, whereat $\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}$ is $\\nu-\\text{ a.s.}$ unique $\\nu=\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\mu$, whereat $\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}$ is $\\mu-\\text{ a.s.}$ unique $$\n\\implies \\nu=\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\mu=\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\nu\n$$ Additionally, it is $\\nu\\ll\\nu$ and $\\nu=f\\nu$ with $f\\equiv 1$. From the $\\mu-\\text{ a.s.}$-uniqueness of the density of $\\nu$ relating to $\\nu$ it follows $$\n\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}=1~\\nu-\\text{ a.s.}\n$$ Finally it is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}=1~\\nu-\\text{ a.s.}\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}=\\left(\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\right)^{-1}~\\nu-\\text{ a.s.}.\n$$ It remains to show, that\n$$\n0<\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}<\\infty~\\mu-\\text{ a.s.}\\text{ resp. }\\nu-\\text{ a.s}\n$$ I was not able to show that yet. Would be great to get some help. Is my previous proof allright? With greetings, math12",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think that your proof is fine. Regarding the missing inequality, you have already shown that \n$\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}=1$ a.e., so of course you have \n$$\n0<\\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu}<\\infty.\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the required format. The user wants me to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, looking at part (1) of the original problem. The user mentions three σ-finite measures μ, ν, η with μ ≪ ν ≪ η. So the assumptions here would be that each of these measures is σ-finite, and the chain of absolute continuity. But each assumption should be on one line for each object. Let me break it down:\n\n- μ, ν, η are σ-finite measures.\n- μ is absolutely continuous with respect to ν (μ ≪ ν).\n- ν is absolutely continuous with respect to η (ν ≪ η).\n\nThen the problem is to prove the chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives: dμ/dη = (dμ/dν)(dν/dη) η-a.s.\n\nFor part (2), the measures μ and ν are finite and mutually absolutely continuous (μ ∼ ν). The assumptions here are:\n\n- μ and ν are finite measures.\n- μ is absolutely continuous with respect to ν (μ ≪ ν).\n- ν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ (ν ≪ μ).\n\nThe problem statements here are two-fold. First, to show that 0 < (dμ/dν)(dν/dμ) < ∞ μ-a.s. (and hence ν-a.s.), and second, that dμ/dν is the reciprocal of dν/dμ μ-a.s.\n\nThe user also provided their attempt, but I need to focus only on the problem and assumptions, not the attempt. Let me make sure each assumption is separate and applies to one object. For example, σ-finiteness applies to all three measures in part (1). But the problem states they are σ-finite, so that's one assumption. Then the absolute continuities are separate for each pair.\n\nWait, the example given in the original query for the first problem lists each assumption on a separate line. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. So similarly, for part (1), the assumptions would be:\n\n- μ, ν, η are σ-finite measures.\n- μ ≪ ν.\n- ν ≪ η.\n\nEach on separate lines. Similarly for part (2):\n\n- μ and ν are finite measures.\n- μ ≪ ν.\n- ν ≪ μ.\n\nThen the problem parts are to prove the respective statements. However, the original problem has two separate parts (1) and (2), each with their own assumptions. The user might want both parts structured. But the example given by the user seems to handle a single problem. The user's instruction says to structure \"the problem\" as per the format. However, the original question here has two parts. So perhaps each part should be treated as a separate problem? But the example given combined both parts into one? Wait, no. Let's check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user might have had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the example, the original problem was for every integer n. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, the example says the original problem is to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is illustrating a different problem where the original problem's assumptions were not clearly stated, and the formatted version lists the correct assumptions. Hmm.\n\nIn any case, the task is to structure the given problem into Assumption and Problem sections. The given problem here has two parts. Let's see the original question:\n\n(1) For three σ-finite measures μ ≪ ν ≪ η, prove that dμ/dη = (dμ/dν)(dν/dη) η-a.s.\n\n(2) For two finite measures μ ∼ ν, prove that 0 < (dμ/dν)(dν/dμ) < ∞ μ-a.s. and ν-a.s., and that dμ/dν = (dν/dμ)^{-1} μ-a.s.\n\nSo each part is a separate problem. But the user's example shows combining the problem into one, but perhaps here we need to split into two problems? However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem is structured separately. But the original question includes two problems. The user might have intended for each part to be a separate structured problem. However, the example given by the user has only one problem. So maybe structure each part as separate? Let me check the user's original example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error, but perhaps the user is filtering out the unnecessary information and listing the actual assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. But actually, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, the task is to structure the problem given here into Assumption and Problem parts.\n\nSo for part (1):\n\nAssumptions:\n- μ, ν, η are σ-finite measures.\n- μ is absolutely continuous with respect to ν (μ ≪ ν).\n- ν is absolutely continuous with respect to η (ν ≪ η).\n\nProblem:\nProve that (dμ/dη) = (dμ/dν)(dν/dη) η-almost surely.\n\nFor part (2):\n\nAssumptions:\n- μ and ν are finite measures.\n- μ and ν are mutually absolutely continuous (μ ≪ ν and ν ≪ μ).\n\nProblem:\nProve that 0 < (dμ/dν)(dν/dμ) < ∞ holds μ-almost surely (and therefore ν-almost surely), and that (dμ/dν) = (dν/dμ)^{-1} μ-almost surely.\n\nBut the user's example only has one problem, but here there are two. The user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\". The original question on Math Stack Exchange has two parts. Therefore, perhaps each part should be formatted separately. But the user's example combines into one. Wait, the user's example was only one problem. The given problem here has two parts. So perhaps each part should be structured separately. Alternatively, since the original question has two parts, maybe structure both together but list all assumptions and then both problems. But the user's example lists assumptions and then the problem. Since the original question here has two separate parts with different assumptions, perhaps each part should be handled as a separate problem. However, the user's instruction might expect a single problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem as given here is split into (1) and (2). So the user's answer should have two structured problems. But in the format, it's Assumption and Problem. So perhaps two separate entries. But the user's example shows one problem. Since the user's instruction says \"the problem\" (singular), but here there are two, maybe it's better to treat them as two separate problems. However, the original user instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", referring to each problem. So perhaps each part (1) and (2) should be formatted separately. Let me proceed accordingly.\n\nFor part (1):\n\nAssumption: μ, ν, η are σ-finite measures.\n\nAssumption: μ is absolutely continuous with respect to ν.\n\nAssumption: ν is absolutely continuous with respect to η.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\(\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\eta} = \\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu} \\cdot \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\eta}\\) holds η-almost surely.\n\nFor part (2):\n\nAssumption: μ and ν are finite measures.\n\nAssumption: μ is absolutely continuous with respect to ν.\n\nAssumption: ν is absolutely continuous with respect to μ.\n\nProblem: Prove that \\(0 < \\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu} \\cdot \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu} < \\infty\\) holds μ-almost surely (and therefore ν-almost surely), and that \\(\\frac{d\\mu}{d\\nu} = \\left( \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu} \\right)^{-1}\\) holds μ-almost surely.\n\nThis way, each part is structured with its own assumptions and problem statement. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property per line. The first part deals with three measures and the chain rule, the second part with two measures and reciprocal relationship.",
