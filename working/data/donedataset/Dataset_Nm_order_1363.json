    "AcceptedAnswer": "Two proofs will be given. One proof is the remaining of this answer, along lines of Schläfli and Coxeter. Second proof, more direct , is given at this answer's remark . Note that $$\\int_{\\sqrt {3/5} }^1 {\\frac{{\\arctan x}}{{\\sqrt {2{x^2} - 1} (3{x^2} - 1)}}dx}  = \\int_1^{\\sqrt {5/3} } {\\frac{{x(\\frac{\\pi }{2} - \\arctan x)}}{{\\sqrt {2 - {x^2}} (3 - {x^2})}}dx}  = \\frac{{{\\pi ^2}}}{{24}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_1^{5/3} {\\frac{{\\arctan \\sqrt x }}{{\\sqrt {2 - x} (3 - x)}}dx}$$ therefore your integral is equivalent to $$\\int_1^{5/3} {\\frac{{\\arctan \\sqrt x }}{{\\sqrt {2 - x} (3 - x)}}dx}  = \\frac{{11{\\pi ^2}}}{{240}}$$ I will prove this by establishing $$\\tag{1}\\int_0^1 {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{\\sqrt {2 - t} (3 - t)}}dt}   = \\frac{{{\\pi ^2}}}{{48}}$$ $$\\tag{2} \\int_0^{5/3} {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{\\sqrt {2 - t} (3 - t)}}dt}  = \\frac{{{\\pi ^2}}}{{15}}$$ The following ideas are an expounded version of Polylogarihm and Associated Functions by Leonard Lewin page 115-117, arguments there are very terse. Let $$S(\\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma ) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{k^n}}}{{{n^2}}}(\\cos 2n\\alpha  - \\cos 2n\\beta  + \\cos 2n\\gamma  - 1)}  - {\\alpha ^2} + {\\beta ^2} - {\\gamma ^2}$$ where $0\\leq \\alpha,\\gamma \\leq \\pi/2, 0\\leq \\beta < \\pi$ and $k$ is a function of $\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$ which will be determined soon.\nIt is easy to check that $$\\frac{{\\partial S}}{{\\partial \\alpha }} =  - 2\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{k^n}}}{n}\\sin 2n\\alpha }  - 2\\alpha   =  - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha } \\right)$$ Therefore the differential $dS$ is $$\\begin{aligned}dS &= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{k^n}}}{n}(\\cos 2n\\alpha  - \\cos 2n\\beta  + \\cos 2n\\gamma  - 1)} dk - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha } \\right)d\\alpha+\\\\ & 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\beta } \\right)d\\beta  - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\gamma } \\right)d\\gamma \\end{aligned}$$ Now choose $k$ such that the coefficient of $dk$ vanishes, using $\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{a^n}\\cos nx}}{n}}  =  - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln ({a^2} - 2a\\cos x + 1)$ one easily see such $k$ is $$ k = \\frac{{\\sqrt {{{\\cos }^2}\\alpha {{\\cos }^2}\\gamma  - {{\\cos }^2}\\beta }  - \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\gamma }}{{\\sqrt {{{\\cos }^2}\\alpha {{\\cos }^2}\\gamma  - {{\\cos }^2}\\beta }  + \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\gamma }}$$ This completes the definition of $S(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ . Note that in order for $k$ to be real, we need to assume the term inside radical is always $\\geq 0$ , we confine ourselves exclusive to this case.  Now $dS$ becomes $$\\tag{3}dS = - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha } \\right)d\\alpha+ 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\beta } \\right)d\\beta  - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\gamma } \\right)d\\gamma $$ Four observations: $S(0,\\beta,\\gamma) = \\pi(\\beta-\\gamma)$ When $\\sin^2 \\alpha + \\sin^2 \\gamma = \\sin^2 \\beta$ , $S(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) =    -\\alpha^2+\\beta^2-\\gamma^2$ When $\\cos \\alpha \\cos\\gamma = \\cos\\beta$ , $S(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)= 0$ . $S(\\alpha,\\pi - 2\\alpha,\\alpha) = 6S(\\alpha,\\pi/3,\\pi/6)$ Proof. For the first one, $\\alpha = 0$ implies $k=1$ , so $$S(0,\\beta ,\\gamma ) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{1}{{{n^2}}}( - \\cos 2n\\beta  + \\cos 2n\\gamma )}  + {\\beta ^2} - {\\gamma ^2} = \\pi (\\beta  - \\gamma )$$ For second one, the condition implies $k=0$ . For third one, the condition implies $k=-1$ , then just evaluate the series. \nThe fourth assertion is more crucial. We prove it carefully. By first bullet, it suffices to prove their derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ are equal. When $\\beta = \\pi/3, \\gamma = \\pi/6$ , one sees that $$\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha = \\sqrt{3 \\cos^2 \\alpha-1} \\sec \\alpha $$ Since $\\beta,\\gamma$ are constants, $d\\gamma = d\\beta = 0$ , $(3)$ shows $$\\tag{A}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dS(\\alpha,\\pi/3,\\pi/6)}{d\\alpha} = \\arctan(\\sqrt{3 \\cos^2 \\alpha-1} \\sec \\alpha)$$ Now consider $S(\\alpha,\\pi - 2\\alpha,\\alpha)$ , with $\\beta = \\pi - 2\\alpha, \\gamma = \\alpha, d\\beta = -2d\\alpha$ , $d\\gamma = d\\alpha$ , one computes via $(3)$ , $$\\tag{B}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dS(\\alpha,\\pi - 2\\alpha,\\alpha)}{d\\alpha} = 2 \\arctan \\left(\\sqrt{\\cos ^4\\alpha-\\cos ^2 2\\alpha} \\csc \\alpha \\sec \\alpha\\right)-2 \\arctan \\left(\\sqrt{\\cos ^4 \\alpha-\\cos ^2 2 \\alpha} \\tan 2 \\alpha \\csc ^2 \\alpha \\right)+2\\pi $$ To complete the proof, it suffices to differentiate RHS of $6\\times (A), (B)$ , and see whether they are equal. This becomes a trivial but computational heavy task. Now let $a>b$ , consider $$\\sqrt {a - b} \\int_0^x {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{\\sqrt {b - t} (a - t)}}dt}  =  - 2\\int_0^x {{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t d({{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b - t}}{{a - b}}} )} $$ fix $\\alpha  = {\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b - t}}{{a - b}}}$ , we find $\\beta,\\gamma$ (depends on $a,b$ but not on $t$ ) such that $$\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha  = \\sqrt t $$ One easily verifies one such pair $\\beta,\\gamma$ is $$\\gamma  = {\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt a }}\\qquad \\beta  = {\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b + 1}}{{a - b}}} $$ Since $\\beta,\\gamma$ are independent of $t$ , $(3)$ implies $$dS(\\alpha ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b + 1}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt a }}) =  - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\left( {\\frac{{1 + k}}{{1 - k}}\\tan \\alpha } \\right)d\\alpha  =  - 2{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t d\\alpha $$ Hence $$\\int_0^x { - 2{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t d\\alpha }  = S({\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b - x}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b + 1}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt a }}) + C$$ for a constant $C$ independent of $x$ . \nSet $x=0$ , then one checks the third bullet point applies for $$S({\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{b}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b + 1}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt a }})$$ therefore it is $0$ , hence $C=0$ . Thus we proved $$\\tag{4}\\int_0^x {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{(a - t)\\sqrt {b - t}\n }}dt}  = \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt {a - b} }}S({\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b -\n x}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{ - 1}}\\sqrt {\\frac{{b + 1}}{{a - b}}} ,{\\tan ^{\n - 1}}\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt a }})$$ Now let $a=3, b=2$ , we deduce from $(4)$ $$\\int_0^1 {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{\\sqrt {2 - t} (3 - t)}}dt}  = S(\\frac{\\pi }{4},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6})\\qquad \\int_0^{5/3} {\\frac{{{{\\tan }^{ - 1}}\\sqrt t }}{{\\sqrt {2 - t} (3 - t)}}dt}  = S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6})$$ Now the second bullet applies for the former one, so $S(\\frac{\\pi }{4},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6}) = \\frac{{{\\pi ^2}}}{{48}}$ , \nthis is $(1)$ . For latter one, note that fourth bullet implies $$6S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6}) = S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{{2\\pi }}{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6})$$ but directly from definition (the $k$ associated with these two pairs are equal), one sees that $$S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{{2\\pi }}{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6}) - S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6}) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\frac{{{k^n}}}{{{n^2}}}(\\underbrace{\\cos \\frac{{2\\pi n}}{3} - \\cos \\frac{{4\\pi n}}{3}}_{=0})}  + {(\\frac{{2\\pi }}{3})^2} - {(\\frac{\\pi }{3})^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}$$ thus $S(\\frac{\\pi }{6},\\frac{\\pi }{3},\\frac{\\pi }{6}) = \\frac{{{\\pi ^2}}}{{15}}$ , this is $(2)$ . The integral claimed by OP is now established.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down the problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving a definite integral equals 3π²/160.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions the integral from sqrt(3/5) to 1 of [arctan(x) / (sqrt(2x² -1)(3x² -1))] dx. The assumptions here are the limits of integration, the integrand, and any conditions needed for the integrand to be defined and integrable.\n\nLooking at the integral's lower limit, sqrt(3/5), and upper limit, 1. The integrand has sqrt(2x² -1), which requires that 2x² -1 ≥ 0. Solving 2x² -1 ≥ 0 gives x ≥ 1/√2 ≈ 0.707. The lower limit sqrt(3/5) is approximately 0.7746, which is greater than 1/√2, so the sqrt is defined in the interval. Also, the denominator has 3x² -1. At x = sqrt(1/3), that term is zero, but sqrt(3/5) is about 0.7746, which is greater than sqrt(1/3) ≈ 0.577, so in the interval [sqrt(3/5), 1], 3x² -1 is positive (since 3*(3/5) = 9/5 = 1.8 >1, so 3x² -1 ≥ 3*(3/5) -1 = 9/5 -5/5 =4/5 >0). Therefore, the denominator doesn't cause any issues in the interval. Arctan(x) is defined everywhere, so the integrand is valid in the interval.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from x = sqrt(3/5) to x = 1.\n- The integrand is arctan(x) divided by [sqrt(2x² -1) multiplied by (3x² -1)].\n- The variables and functions involved satisfy the conditions for the integral to exist (i.e., integrable, no division by zero, etc.), which is covered by the limits being in the valid domain as established.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$,\nThe upper limit of integration is $1$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$,\nThe integrand is defined and integrable on the interval $[\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, 1]$.\n\nBut maybe the last point is redundant since the integral limits already ensure that. Alternatively, since the problem might assume standard conditions, maybe just list the components. The example given had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Here, the integral's limits and the integrand structure are critical.\n\nWait, in the example, they included specific conditions on n. Here, the integral's limits are specific, and the integrand is specific. So following the example, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$ to $x = 1$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$.\n\nBut maybe also the conditions ensuring the integrand is defined. However, since the user's example didn't include the divisibility by 13 or other hidden conditions, but in their example they had n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem might not have additional hidden conditions beyond the integral's structure. The user might just need the integral limits and the integrand as assumptions.\n\nWait, the original example had two assumptions: n is integer, and n divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$,\nThe upper limit of integration is $1$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$,\nThe function $\\sqrt{2x^2 -1}$ is real-valued on the interval $[\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, 1]$,\nThe denominator $3x^2 -1$ is non-zero on the interval $[\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, 1]$.\n\nBut maybe some of these are redundant because the integral's limits already ensure that. For example, since sqrt(3/5) is greater than sqrt(1/3), 3x² -1 is positive on [sqrt(3/5),1]. Similarly, 2x² -1 is positive since sqrt(3/5) is greater than 1/sqrt(2). So perhaps these are necessary assumptions. But in the example provided by the user, they didn't list such conditions for the expression to be defined. For example, in the original problem A(n), they didn't list that 5^n is defined, which it is for integer n. So maybe in the problem's assumptions, the necessary conditions are the integral's limits and the integrand structure.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval $x \\in [\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}, 1]$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$.\n\nBut the example listed two separate assumptions for different properties. So here, the lower limit, the upper limit, the integrand. But maybe the problem as stated in the title already has the integral limits and integrand. So the key is to extract all the conditions from the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem statement in the question:\n\n\"Prove that $$\\int_{\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}}^1 \\frac{\\arctan (x)}{\\sqrt{2 x^2-1} \\left(3 x^2-1\\right)} \\, dx=\\frac{3 \\pi ^2}{160}$$\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove the equality. The assumptions here are the integral setup: limits, integrand. So each part of the integral setup is an assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The lower limit of integration is $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\n- The upper limit of integration is $1$.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove that this integral equals 3π²/160.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$,\nThe upper limit of integration is $1$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} (3x^2 -1)}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}}^1 \\frac{\\arctan (x)}{\\sqrt{2 x^2-1} \\left(3 x^2-1\\right)} \\, dx=\\frac{3 \\pi ^2}{160}.$$\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So here, the three parts of the integral setup (lower, upper, integrand) would each be separate assumptions. So each line is a separate assumption. The problem then is the statement to prove.\n\nSo the answer should be structured as:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe lower limit of integration is $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}$,\nThe upper limit of integration is $1$,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\arctan(x)}{\\sqrt{2x^2 -1} \\left(3x^2 -1\\right)}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}}^1 \\frac{\\arctan (x)}{\\sqrt{2 x^2-1} \\left(3 x^2-1\\right)} \\, dx=\\frac{3 \\pi ^2}{160}.$$",
