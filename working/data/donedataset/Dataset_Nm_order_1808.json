This is pretty clear by UPF, but I'm having some trouble proving it using divisibility theorems. I was looking at this Math.SE problem , and if this could be proven, then the solution would follow immediately.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $\\gcd(a,b)=1$ then there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a s +b t =1$. Hence $c a s +c b  t =c$. Now since $a \\vert c$ and $b \\vert c$ there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $c = m a$ and $c= n b$. Hence $n b a s  + m a b  t =c$. Since $a b $ divides the entire left hand side, it must also divide the right hand side.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"If gcd(a,b)=1 and a and b divide c, then so does ab\". The question body repeats the problem: using divisibility theorems, prove that if gcd(a,b)=1, a divides c, and b divides c, then ab divides c. The user mentions that it's clear using UPF (Unique Prime Factorization) but they're having trouble proving it with divisibility theorems.\n\nSo, the task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem involves a, b, and c. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. gcd(a, b) = 1. That's a single condition involving both a and b, but since it's a property of their greatest common divisor, maybe that's considered one assumption.\n\n2. a divides c. That's a separate condition applied to a and c.\n\n3. b divides c. Similarly, a separate condition applied to b and c.\n\nEach of these is a separate line in the assumption section. Then the problem is to prove that ab divides c.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the assumption about n being an integer was separate from the divisibility by 7. Here, the gcd condition is one assumption, and the divisibility of c by a and by b are two more. So three assumptions in total.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is only one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nThat seems to fit the structure. Let me check if there's any hidden assumption. The problem is about integers, so maybe we need to state that a, b, c are integers? But the original problem doesn't explicitly say that. However, in number theory problems, divisibility is usually considered in the context of integers. But the user didn't mention it. The example given didn't have to state that n is an integer because it was part of the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included that n is an integer. Here, the original problem says \"if gcd(a,b)=1 and a and b divide c\", but it's possible that a, b, c are assumed to be positive integers. However, the problem might be considering a, b, c as integers, not necessarily positive. But in the context of divisibility, usually, we consider positive integers unless stated otherwise. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify, but in the example, they included that n is an integer. So perhaps here, we need to include that a, b, c are integers. Wait, but the original question didn't state that explicitly. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"if gcd(a,b)=1 and a|c and b|c, then ab|c\". The user is asking to prove this using divisibility theorems. The problem as stated doesn't specify the domain of a, b, c, but in mathematics, gcd is defined for integers, and divisibility is also in the context of integers. So, perhaps the assumptions should include that a, b, c are integers. However, the original problem didn't state that. But in the example given by the user, the original problem did state \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included that. Here, the original problem didn't state that a, b, c are integers. Hmm. That's a bit of a dilemma. Do I need to include that as an assumption?\n\nWait, the problem is on Math Stack Exchange, and the user is referring to it. Let me check the standard approach. In divisibility problems, unless otherwise specified, a, b, c are assumed to be integers, and typically positive integers. But strictly speaking, gcd is defined for integers, so a and b must be integers. Also, divisibility is defined in the integers. So, perhaps the assumptions should include that a, b, c are integers. However, the original problem didn't state that. But the example given included \"n is an integer\" because the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So in this case, since the original problem doesn't mention a, b, c being integers, but the context is about divisibility and gcd, which are integer concepts, maybe we should include that as assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem on Math Stack Exchange, the user probably assumes that a, b, c are integers. But if the problem is to structure it according to the example, the example took the original problem's explicit statements. The original example said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included that n is an integer. Here, the original problem didn't say \"for integers a, b, c\", but the context implies that. However, since the user's example included assumptions that were explicitly stated, perhaps in this case, since the problem doesn't explicitly say \"for integers a, b, c\", we shouldn't include it. But that might be incorrect because gcd and divisibility are about integers.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again. The user wrote: \"if gcd(a,b)=1 and a|c and b|c, then ab|c\". So in mathematical terms, gcd(a,b)=1 implies that a and b are integers. So perhaps the assumption that a and b are integers is implicit in the gcd. But c could be a real number? No, because divisibility is also defined in integers. So, perhaps a, b, c are integers. But since the original problem didn't state it, but in the example, it was included because the original problem stated it, maybe here we need to include that a, b, c are integers as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user doesn't consider that necessary, as the context implies it. But to follow the example's structure, which included the domain (integer n) when it was in the original problem, here since it's not stated, maybe we shouldn't. However, without specifying that a, b, c are integers, the problem isn't well-defined. For example, in a general ring, gcd and divisibility can have different meanings. But in the context of Math Stack Exchange and typical number theory problems, it's about integers.\n\nHmm. Since the example included the domain when it was given, but here it's not given, perhaps we need to infer and include it. But the original problem didn't state \"for integers a, b, c\", so maybe we shouldn't. However, to make the problem well-defined, we need to assume that a, b, c are integers. Otherwise, the problem could be in a different context. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, and c are integers,\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nBut wait, the original problem didn't state that a, b, c are integers. So is this an assumption we need to add? In the example, the problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included that. Here, since the problem is about divisibility and gcd, which are integer concepts, perhaps we must include it. Otherwise, the problem is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem assumes that a, b, c are positive integers. But again, it's not specified. This is a bit tricky. Since the user's example included the domain when it was part of the original problem, and here it's not, but the problem is about divisibility, which requires integers, maybe the correct answer is to include that a, b, c are integers as separate assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included that. Here, the original problem didn't say \"for integers a, b, c\", but maybe it's implied. However, to structure it properly, perhaps we need to list all explicit and implicit assumptions. But since the problem is on Math Stack Exchange, and the user is asking for help, perhaps the answer should include the necessary assumptions to make the problem well-defined.\n\nSo, considering all that, the assumptions should include that a, b, c are integers, gcd(a,b)=1, a divides c, and b divides c. Then the problem is to prove ab divides c.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, and c are integers,\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. Here, \"a, b, and c are integers\" is three objects in one line, which might not fit the format. The instruction says \"Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So perhaps each object's property should be on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na is an integer,\nb is an integer,\nc is an integer,\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nBut this seems a bit too detailed. The original example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So the first is about the type, the second a condition. But perhaps in that example, n being an integer was part of the problem statement. Here, the problem doesn't state that a, b, c are integers, but they have to be for gcd and divisibility to make sense. So, to be precise, we need to list each as an integer. But the format requires each assumption to be a single line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So \"a is an integer\", \"b is an integer\", \"c is an integer\", then the other conditions.\n\nHowever, in practice, maybe the problem assumes a, b, c are integers, so perhaps the user doesn't want to list them as separate assumptions unless explicitly stated. Since the example included \"n is an integer\" because the original problem said \"for every integer n\", here the problem didn't say \"for integers a, b, c\", but it's necessary for the problem to make sense. So this is a bit of a judgment call.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem assumes a, b, c are positive integers, and the answer should reflect that. However, since the problem didn't specify, but in the context, divisibility is over integers, not necessarily positive. For example, a and b could be negative, but gcd(a,b) is still defined as a positive integer. So perhaps we need to assume a and b are positive integers? Not necessarily. The problem could work with any integers, but ab divides c even if a or b are negative, as long as their product divides c.\n\nBut in any case, the key assumptions needed for the problem are:\n\n1. gcd(a, b) = 1.\n\n2. a divides c.\n\n3. b divides c.\n\nAdditionally, the problem is in the context of integers, so perhaps a, b, c are integers. But since the original problem didn't state that, but the example included the domain when it was given, here maybe we need to omit it. However, without that assumption, the problem isn't properly defined. For example, if a, b, c are real numbers, then gcd isn't defined. So to make the problem valid, we must assume a, b, c are integers.\n\nBut the original problem didn't state that, so perhaps in the formatted problem, we shouldn't include it. But that would leave the problem ill-defined. This is a conflict. The example included the domain (integer n) because it was part of the original problem's statement. Here, since it's not, but necessary, should we include it?\n\nGiven that the user's example included the domain when it was given, and here it's not given, but necessary, perhaps we should include it as an implicit assumption. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be within the integers, so the assumptions are just the ones stated: gcd(a,b)=1, a|c, b|c, and the conclusion is ab|c.\n\nBut strictly following the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption included n is an integer. Here, the problem didn't say \"for integers a, b, c\", so perhaps we shouldn't include it. But then the problem is not fully specified. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer is that the original problem, as stated on Math Stack Exchange, already assumes that a, b, c are integers because it's talking about divisibility and gcd. Therefore, even though it's not explicitly stated, those are part of the context. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we can list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nBecause the integers assumption is implicit in the context of divisibility and gcd. The example included n is an integer because the original problem explicitly said \"for every integer n\". Here, the original problem didn't, but it's still about integers. So we can omit the integer assumption as it's considered given in the context.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\ngcd(a, b) = 1,\na divides c,\nb divides c.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ab divides c.\n\nEach assumption is one condition, applied to one object (gcd(a,b) is a condition on a and b, but it's a single property). The problem is clear.",
