    "Content": "Let $\\mathscr{F}$ be a collection of connected subsets of a metric space $M$ such that $\\bigcap\\mathscr{F}\\ne\\emptyset$. Prove that $\\bigcup\\mathscr{F}$ is connected. If $\\bigcup\\mathscr{F}$ is not connected, then it can be partitioned into two disjoint, non-empty subsets $A,B$. Let $x$ be a point in $\\bigcap\\mathscr{F}$. Then either $x\\in A$ or $x\\in B$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "HINT: You’re actually about halfway there, though you omitted an important qualification of $A$ and $B$: if $\\bigcup\\mathscr{F}$ is not connected, then it can be partitioned into two disjoint, non-empty, relatively open subsets $A$ and $B$. Now fix $x\\in\\bigcap\\mathscr{F}$, and without loss of generality assume that $x\\in A$. $B\\ne\\varnothing$, so pick any $y\\in B$. Then there is some $F\\in\\mathscr{F}$ such that $y\\in F$, and of course $x\\in F$. Thus, $x\\in A\\cap F$, and $y\\in B\\cap F$, so $A\\cap F\\ne\\varnothing\\ne B\\cap F$. Why is this a contradiction?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor, so I need to structure the problem properly first. The original question is about proving that the union of connected subsets is connected if their intersection is nonempty. Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking down the assumptions.\n\nFirst, the problem states that we have a collection F of connected subsets of a metric space M. The intersection of all these subsets in F is nonempty. The goal is to prove that the union of all subsets in F is connected. \n\nThe user's attempt mentions assuming the union is not connected, leading to a partition into two disjoint non-empty sets A and B. Then, since the intersection is nonempty, there's a point x common to all subsets in F, which must be in either A or B. But they don't know where to go next.\n\nI need to structure the problem according to the specified format. Let's see. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Each element of the collection F is a connected subset of the metric space M. So every member of F is connected.\n2. The intersection of all elements in F is nonempty. There exists at least one point common to all subsets in F.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the union of all subsets in F is connected. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user might have mentioned the metric space, but the actual problem could be in a general topological space. However, the question here specifies a metric space M. So the assumptions are about the collection F being connected subsets of M, and their intersection being nonempty. So the formatted problem should include these two points.\n\nNow, checking the example provided: The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the user structured it as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. Wait, but maybe the example was incorrect. Wait, the example given by the user in the prompt was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem is for all integers n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. Maybe the example is wrong, but regardless, I need to follow the instructions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is correctly structured. The problem is: Let F be a collection of connected subsets of M (a metric space) with nonempty intersection. Prove the union is connected. The user's attempt starts by assuming the union is not connected, hence partitioned into A and B, and since x is in the intersection, x is in either A or B. Then, how to proceed.\n\nBut the task here is not to solve the problem but to format it according to the given structure. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. Each member of F is a connected subset of M.\n2. The intersection of all members of F is nonempty.\n\nProblem: Prove that the union of all members of F is connected.\n\nSo I need to list these two assumptions, each as a separate line. Then state the problem. Let me check if there are any other assumptions. The problem is in a metric space, but maybe that's part of the problem's context. The key assumptions are the connectedness of each subset in F and the nonempty intersection. So yes, that's the correct structure.",
