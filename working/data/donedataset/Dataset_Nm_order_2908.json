    "Content": "$A$ and $B$ are $n×n$ symmetric matrices, their non-zero eigenvalues are $(\\lambda_{1},\\ldots,\\lambda_{r} )$，$( \\mu_{1},\\ldots,\\mu_{s} )$.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Edit: As stated this is not true. Take\n $$A=\\begin{bmatrix}2 &0 &0\\\\0&1 &0 \\\\ 0 & 0&0\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } B= \\begin{bmatrix}0 &0 &0\\\\0&1 &0 \\\\ 0 & 0&1\\end{bmatrix}$$ \nthen $AB \\ne 0$, but $A,B, A+B$ fulfill the hypothesis.\nSo you can either assume that $A,B$ are positive semi-definite as orangeskid did or assume that the multiplicities add up as I will do: What do we know about a diagonalizable matrix $M$? By looking at eigenspaces with non zero eigenvalue and the eigenspace with eigenvalue zero we get the decomposition\n$$k^n= \\operatorname{im} M \\oplus \\ker M$$ They are an isomorphism when restricted to their image. By counting eigenvalues we know that\n$$\\operatorname{rank}{A}+ \\operatorname{rank}{B} = \\operatorname{rank}{(A+B)}.$$ This gives us $\\dim\\text{im}{A} + \\dim \\text{im}{B} =\\dim \\text{im}{(A+B)}$ by looking at the dimension of subspaces we know that the intersection must be $0$ and thus\n$$\\operatorname{im}{A} \\oplus \\operatorname{im}{B} =\\operatorname{im}{(A+B)}.$$ In other word we get a decomposition \n$$k^n = \\operatorname{im}{A} \\oplus \\operatorname{im}{B} \\oplus \\ker (A+B).$$ How does \n$\\ker (A+B)$\nlooks like? We know that $\\ker(A) \\cap \\ker(B) \\subset \\ker (A+B)$, but since $\\operatorname{im}{A} $ and $\\operatorname{im}{B} $ only intersect at zero we get equiality. Thus \n$$k^n = \\operatorname{im}{A} \\oplus \\operatorname{im}{B} \\oplus( \\ker(A) \\cap \\ker(B)),$$ hence we can assume that $A+B$ is an isomorphism and diagonalize $A$ and $B$ on their images. Let $O$ be orthonormal such that $A$ is diagonalized on $\\operatorname{im} A$ and let $U$ be orthonormal such that $B$ is diagonalized on $\\operatorname{im} B$ Choose appropriate $M,N,C$  such that\n$$A+B=\\begin{bmatrix}M &C\\\\ C^T& N\\end{bmatrix} $$ then $$T= \\begin{bmatrix}O^T &0\\\\ 0& U^T\\end{bmatrix}   \\begin{bmatrix}M &C\\\\ C^T& N\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}O &0\\\\ 0& U\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}O^T M O & O^T CU\\\\  U^T C^TO& U^TNU  \\end{bmatrix} . $$ Now let us consider the trace of the square of $T$\n\\begin{align*} \\operatorname{tr}(T^2) &=  \\operatorname{tr} (O^T M^2O + O^TC C^TO)+ \\operatorname{tr} (U^T N^2U + U^TC^T CU)  \\\\\n&=  \\sum \\lambda_i + \\operatorname{tr}(CC^T) + \\sum \\mu_i + \\operatorname{tr}(C^TC)\n\\end{align*} where \n$$ \\operatorname{tr}(T^2) = \\operatorname{tr}(A+B)^2 =  \\sum \\lambda_i + \\sum \\mu_i $$\nand $\\operatorname{tr}(CC^T) >0,$\nthus we can conclude that\n$$ C=0.$$ Hence $T$ is diagonal, thus we have  $\\operatorname{im}A \\subset \\ker B$ and $\\operatorname{im}B \\subset \\ker A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that AB = BA = 0 given certain conditions on the eigenvalues of A, B, and A+B. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are n×n symmetric matrices. So that's one assumption: both A and B are symmetric. \n\nNext, their non-zero eigenvalues are given as (λ₁,…,λᵣ) for A and (μ₁,…,μₛ) for B. Then, the non-zero eigenvalues of A+B are the union of these two sets. So another assumption is about the eigenvalues of A+B being the union. \n\nBut wait, the note mentions that the non-zero eigenvalues form a multiset, so the union is a multiset union. So the eigenvalues of A+B are exactly the combination of the non-zero eigenvalues of A and B, counting multiplicities. That should be another assumption. \n\nAlso, since they are symmetric matrices, they are diagonalizable, right? But maybe that's implicit. The problem doesn't state that explicitly, so maybe I don't need to include it. \n\nThe problem wants to show that AB = BA = 0. So the conclusion is about the product of A and B being zero. \n\nWait, are there any other conditions? The original problem mentions that the nonzero eigenvalues of A+B are the union. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A and B are symmetric (hence diagonalizable).\n2. The non-zero eigenvalues of A are {λ₁,…,λᵣ}.\n3. The non-zero eigenvalues of B are {μ₁,…,μₛ}.\n4. The non-zero eigenvalues of A+B are the union (as multisets) of the non-zero eigenvalues of A and B.\n\nThen the problem is to show AB = BA = 0.\n\nSo, each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property of one object. Let me list them:\n\n- A is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n- B is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n- The non-zero eigenvalues of A are λ₁, λ₂, …, λᵣ.\n- The non-zero eigenvalues of B are μ₁, μ₂, …, μₛ.\n- The non-zero eigenvalues of A + B are the union (as multisets) of the non-zero eigenvalues of A and B.\n\nWait, but in the example given, sometimes they split the properties even more. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So maybe here, each bullet point should be a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n symmetric matrix,\nB is an n×n symmetric matrix,\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of A form the multiset {λ₁, λ₂, …, λᵣ},\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of B form the multiset {μ₁, μ₂, …, μₛ},\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of A + B form the multiset union of the nonzero eigenvalues of A and B.\n\nProblem: Show that AB = BA = 0.\n\nBut maybe \"multiset union\" needs to be clarified. The note says that the union is of multisets. So perhaps we should specify that the union is as multisets, considering multiplicities. But how to phrase that concisely.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem mentions \"the set of nonzero eigenvalues of A + B is union of set of nonzero eigenvalues of A and B\", but with the note that they are multisets. So in the assumption, we have to mention that the union is a multiset union. So maybe:\n\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of A + B are the multiset union of the nonzero eigenvalues of A and the nonzero eigenvalues of B.\n\nBut perhaps we can rephrase it as:\n\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of A + B are exactly the nonzero eigenvalues of A and B (counting multiplicities).\n\nHmm. The key point is that when you take the eigenvalues of A+B, they are the combination of eigenvalues from A and B without any cancellation or addition. That's a crucial condition here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n- B is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n- The multiset of nonzero eigenvalues of A is {λ₁, …, λᵣ}.\n- The multiset of nonzero eigenvalues of B is {μ₁, …, μₛ}.\n- The multiset of nonzero eigenvalues of A + B is the union of {λ₁, …, λᵣ} and {μ₁, …, μₛ}.\n\nThus, each of these is a separate assumption. Each addresses one property of one object (either A, B, or A+B). \n\nSo the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line, then state the problem to show AB = BA = 0.",
