    "Content": "Theorem. $|a||b|=|ab|$ Proof. Applying the definition of absolute value, the left hand side of the equation could be either $a\\times(-b)$ or $(-a)\\times(b)$ or $a\\times b$ or $(-a)\\times(-b)$. For this reason we could have either $-ab$ or $ab$. If we apply the definition of absolute value to the right hand side of our equation, we discover that we could have either $-ab$ or $ab$. So the theorem is proved. Is this proof valid? Is it elegant from a mathematical viewpoint? Thank you. Edit: The definition of absolute value I am using above is the following: $$|x|=\\begin{cases}x, & \\text{if $x\\ge0$}\\\\-x,&\\text{if $x<0$}\\end{cases}$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No, as far as I can see you have said that the left side is either $ab$ or $-ab$ and that the right side is either $ab$ or $-ab$, but you haven't argued that both the left and the right side are equal to $ab$ or $-ab$ simultaneously, depending on what the sign of $a$ and $b$ might be. For instance, you haven't proved the impossibility that the left side of the equation is $ab$ while the right side of the equation is $-ab$. To make the proof correct, consider the four exhaustive cases $a \\geq 0$, $b \\geq 0$ $a \\geq 0$, $b < 0$ $a < 0$, $b \\geq 0$ $a < 0$, $b < 0$ separately, and verify that the equation $|ab| = |a||b|$ holds in each case. Another way to prove this is to use the fact that $|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem. The original question is about proving that the absolute value of a product equals the product of the absolute values. The user provided a proof and is asking if it's valid and elegant.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem shows that assumptions are specific conditions. But in this case, the theorem is general for all real numbers a and b. So the assumptions should be the properties used. Let me check the original question again. The user mentions the definition of absolute value as a piecewise function. So maybe the assumptions include that definition.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. So for this problem, the key assumptions are related to the definition of absolute value. The problem is to determine if the given proof is valid and elegant. However, in the format, the \"Problem\" part should restate the original theorem to prove. The user's actual question is about the validity and elegance of their proof, but the format example shows that the problem is the statement to prove. So maybe the original problem here is the theorem itself, and the assumptions are the definitions used.\n\nSo the assumptions would be the definition of absolute value for any real number x. Since the definition is split into cases based on x's sign, each case could be an assumption. But in the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the definition of absolute value is a key assumption. Let me structure it:\n\nAssumption: For any real number x, |x| is defined as x if x ≥ 0, and -x if x < 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that |a||b| = |ab|.\n\nBut the user's original question is asking whether their proof is valid and elegant, but according to the format example, the problem should be the mathematical statement to prove. So I think the problem part should be the theorem statement, and the assumptions are the definitions needed. The user's actual question about the proof's validity is part of the original problem, but the structured format seems to focus on the mathematical problem itself, not the meta-question about the proof. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem restates that as the problem with assumptions. So here, the theorem to prove is |a||b|=|ab|, and the assumption is the definition of absolute value. The user's question about their proof's validity isn't part of the formatted problem—it's the context, but the task is to extract the problem and assumptions. So I need to present the theorem and its assumptions as per the definition given. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: The absolute value of a real number x is defined as |x| = x if x ≥ 0, and |x| = -x if x < 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that |a||b| = |ab| for all real numbers a and b.\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The original question's proof attempt and the query about its validity are part of the context but not part of the structured problem. The task is to extract the problem and its assumptions. The example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So maybe in that example, they filtered out the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but wait, the original example's formatted problem actually adds an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example given by the user shows:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. The original says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. But maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it in the formatted problem? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut 91 is 7*13. If n is divisible by both 7 and 13, then maybe the original problem actually required n to be divisible by 7, but the user's original problem states \"for every integer n\". So the example might be incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. This suggests that the assistant (me) should pay attention to the original problem's actual conditions and structure accordingly, even if the example is conflicting.\n\nBut in any case, following the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes specific assumptions. So perhaps the user wants to list all the necessary conditions from the problem, even if they are general. Wait, in the example, the original problem's A(n) is claimed for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their structure regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question is about |a||b|=|ab|. The original problem's proof attempt uses the definition of absolute value, so the key assumption is that definition. So following the example, even if the original problem says \"for all real numbers a and b\", the formatted problem should list the assumptions as per the definitions used. So in this case, the assumption is the definition of absolute value as given. Then the problem is to prove the theorem. So the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: For any real number x, |x| is defined as x if x ≥ 0, and -x if x < 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that |a||b| = |ab| for all real numbers a and b.\n\nThat's the structured problem as per the format, filtering out the extra information about the user's proof and their question about its validity. The example showed that the user's original problem had an assumption (n is an integer) and added another (n divisible by 7), but in the current case, the assumptions are the definitions. So I think this is the correct approach.",
