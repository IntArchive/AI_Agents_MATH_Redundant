    "Content": "Show that the curve $x^2+y^2-3=0$ has no rational points, that is, no points $(x,y)$ with $x,y\\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Update: Thanks for all the input! I've done my best to incorporate your suggestions and write up the proof. My explanation of why $\\gcd(a,b,q)=1$ is a bit verbose, but I couldn't figure out how to put it more concisely with clear notation. Proof : Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists a point $P=(x,y)$, such that $x^2+y^2-3=0$, with $x,y\\in\\mathbb{Q}$. Then we can express $x$ and $y$ as irreducible fractions and write $(\\frac{n_x}{d_x})^2+(\\frac{n_y}{d_y})^2-3=0$, with $n_x, d_x, n_y, d_y\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\gcd(n_x,d_x)=\\gcd(n_y,d_y)=1$. Let $q$ equal the lowest common multiple of $d_x$ and $d_y$. So $q=d_xc_x$ and $q=d_yc_y$ for the mutually prime integers $c_x$ and $c_y$ (if they weren't mutually prime, then $q$ wouldn't be the lowest common multiple). If we set $a=n_xc_x$ and $b=n_yc_y$, we can write the original equation as $(a/q)^2+(b/q^2)-3=0$, and equivalently, $a^2+b^2=3q^2$. In order to determine the greatest common divisor shared by $a$, $b$, and $q$, we first consider the prime factors of $a$. Since $a=n_xc_x$, we can group them into the factors of $n_x$ and those of $c_x$. Similarly, $b$'s prime factors can be separated into those of $n_y$ and those of $c_y$. We know that $c_x$ and $c_y$ don't share any factors, as they're mutually prime, so any shared factor of $a$ and $b$ must be a factor of $n_x$ and $n_y$. Furthermore, $q=d_xc_x=d_yc_y$, so it's prime factors can either be grouped  into those of $d_x$ and those of $c_x$, or those of $d_y$ and those of $c_y$. As we've already eliminated $c_x$ and $c_y$ as sources of shared factors, we know that any shared factor of $a$, $b$, and $q$ must be a factor of $n_x$, $n_y$, and either $d_x$ or $d_y$. But since $n_x/d_x$ is an irreducible fraction, $n_x$ and $d_x$ share no prime factors. Similarly, $n_y$ and $d_y$ share no prime factors. Thus $a$, $b$, and $q$ share no prime factors, and their greatest common divisor must be $1$. Now consider an integer $m$ such that $3\\nmid m$. Then, either $m\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$, or $m\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. If $m\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$, then $m=3k+1$ for some integer $k$, and $m^2=9k^2+6k+1=3(3k^2+2k)+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$. Similarly, if $m\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$, then $m^2=3(3k^2+4k+1)+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$. Since that exhausts all cases, we see that $3\\nmid m \\implies m^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$ for $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Notice that $a^2+b^2=3q^2$ implies that $3\\mid (a^2+b^2)$. If $3$ doesn't divide both of $a$ and $b$, then $(a^2+b^2)$ will be either $1\\pmod{3}$ or $2\\pmod{3}$, and thus not divisible by $3$. So we can deduce that both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $3$. We can therefore write $a=3u$ $\\land$ $b=3v$ for some integers $u$ and $v$. Thus, $9u^2+9v^2=3q^2$, and equivalently, $3(u^2+v^2)=q^2$. So $3$ divides $q^2$, and must therefore divide $q$ as well. Thus, $3$ is a factor of $a,b,$ and $q$, but this contradicts the fact that $\\gcd(a,b,q)=1$, and falsifies our supposition that such a point $P=(x,y)$ exists.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose to the contrary that there is a rational solution of the equation. Then there exist integers $a$ , $b$ and $q$ , with $q\\ne 0$ , such that $a^2+b^2=3q^2$ , and $a$ , $b$ and $q$ have no common factor greater than $1$ . Note that $a$ and $b$ must both be divisible by $3$ . For if an integer $m$ is not divisible by $3$ , then $m^2$ has remainder $1$ on division by $3$ . So if one or both of $a$ and $b$ is not divisible by $3$ , then $a^2+b^2$ has remainder $1$ or $2$ on division by $3$ , and therefore cannot be of the shape $3q^2$ . Thus both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $3$ . It follows that $q$ is divisible by $3$ , contradicting our assumption that $a$ , $b$ and $q$ have no common divisor greater than $1$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about showing that the curve x² + y² - 3 = 0 has no rational points. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem here, the main assumptions are that x and y are rational numbers, and the equation x² + y² = 3 holds. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user mentions \"no points (x,y) with x,y ∈ ℚ\". So the key assumptions are that x and y are rational, right? The equation itself is part of the problem statement. The update in the question includes details about expressing x and y as fractions, but maybe those are part of the proof rather than assumptions. The actual problem doesn't state any additional conditions like divisibility unless it's part of the problem. \n\nSo for the Assumption section, it should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\ny is a rational number,\nx and y satisfy x² + y² - 3 = 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show there are no such x and y. So the assumptions are the conditions that would lead to a contradiction. So when structuring the problem, the problem is to show that there's no solution under these assumptions. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was to prove divisibility, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and then the problem statement. In this case, the problem is to show that there are no rational points, so the assumptions would be that x and y are in ℚ, and the equation holds. \n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\ny is a rational number,\nx² + y² - 3 = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there are no points (x, y) with x, y ∈ ℚ.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which were part of the problem's conditions. In this case, the problem is to show that there are no such points, so the assumptions would be the existence of such points (which leads to contradiction). But perhaps the way to structure it is to list the conditions that would need to hold if such points existed. So the assumptions are the properties that such points would have, which are x and y are rational, and they satisfy the equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Show that the curve x² + y² - 3 = 0 has no rational points\", so the assumptions are implicit: the existence of such points (x,y) where x and y are rational, and x² + y² = 3. Then the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, hence no such points exist. \n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. So in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the original problem is to show that there are no rational points. So the assumptions here would be the conditions that a rational point must satisfy. So x and y being rational and the equation holding. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions that x and y are rational, and they satisfy the equation. The problem is to show that such points don't exist. \n\nTherefore, the correct format would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\ny is a rational number,\nx and y satisfy x² + y² - 3 = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there are no such points (x, y).\n\nBut wait, the example in the user's message had the problem restated as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So maybe the problem part here should be \"Prove that the curve x² + y² - 3 = 0 has no rational points,\" but according to the user's example, they rephrased the problem more succinctly. The original problem's title is \"Show that the curve x² + y² - 3 = 0 has no rational points,\" which is already concise. \n\nSo the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a rational number,\ny is a rational number,\nx² + y² - 3 = 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the curve x² + y² - 3 = 0 has no rational points.\n\nBut the user's example also split each assumption into separate lines. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So \"x is a rational number\" and \"y is a rational number\" are separate assumptions. Then the equation is another assumption. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Each line is one condition. So the assumptions are three separate points: x in ℚ, y in ℚ, and the equation. Then the problem is to show that these conditions cannot all be satisfied, hence no rational points.",
