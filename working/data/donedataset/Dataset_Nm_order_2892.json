    "Content": "It seems reasonable for me that if $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ is the constant map then $f_{*}:H_{n}(X)\\rightarrow H_{n}(Y)$ is the zero map for $n>0$. But I don't see how to prove this. If $n$ is odd then it is OK as if $[p]_{n}$ denote the class of unique map from $\\Delta^{n}\\to Y$ then for odd $n$, $[p]_{n}=\\partial[p]_{n+1}$. How to show for even $n$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think it's simpler to see that if $f : X \\to Y$ is a constant map, then it factors through as $X \\to * \\to Y$ where $*$ is a singleton. Therefore $f_*$ factors through $H_n(X) \\to H_n(*) \\to H_n(Y)$. But $H_n(*) = 0$ for $n > 0$, from which you conclude that $f_*$ is the zero map. In fact this proof shows that any cycle in $C_n(X)$ (I guess it's singular homology here?) gets sent to zero on the level of chains for even $n$; because if $\\sigma \\in C_n(X)$ is a cycle, so is its image in $C_n(*)$, but there are no nontrivial cycles in $C_n(*)$ when $n>0$ is even. In particular it will be hard to find a chain whose boundary is $[p]_n$, because it's not even a cycle, actually! PS: It's a general fact that working directly from the definition of the homology is way too complicated, except in very special cases and/or for very technical proofs. Working with properties of homology is much cleaner.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that a constant map induces the zero homomorphism in homology for degrees n > 0. The question mentions that for odd n, it's manageable because the class of the constant map can be expressed as a boundary of a higher-dimensional simplex. But they're stuck on the even case.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some homology theory. Homology groups measure the \"holes\" in a space. The induced homomorphism f_* maps cycles in X to cycles in Y via the map f. If f is constant, it should map all cycles to a single point, which is a boundary in higher dimensions. Wait, but how does that work exactly?\n\nIn singular homology, a constant map factors through the singleton space. The homology of a point is trivial except in degree 0. So for n > 0, H_n(point) is zero. Therefore, the induced map f_* should factor through H_n(point), which is zero, hence f_* must be the zero map. But maybe the user is thinking in terms of chains and boundaries, not just the abstract functoriality.\n\nAlternatively, for any singular n-simplex σ in X, the constant map sends σ to the constant simplex at some point y in Y. Then, in the chain complex, this constant simplex is a generator of the group C_n(Y). But in homology, we need to see if this is a boundary. If Y is a point, all higher homology groups are zero, so the induced map must be zero. But if Y is arbitrary, does the constant map still induce zero?\n\nWait, but the problem states that f is constant, so regardless of Y, the image is a single point. The induced map on homology factors through the homology of that point. Since H_n(point) = 0 for n > 0, the map f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) must be zero because it's the composition H_n(X) → H_n({point}) → H_n(Y), and the middle term is zero. So regardless of even or odd n, as long as n > 0, the induced map is zero. Maybe the user is overcomplicating by splitting into even and odd cases.\n\nBut the user mentioned that for odd n, they can write [p]_n as the boundary of [p]_{n+1}, but for even n, that's not possible. Wait, in singular homology, any constant n-simplex [p] is a cycle, but if n is odd, can it be a boundary? Wait, the boundary of a constant (n+1)-simplex would be an alternating sum. For example, if n=1, a constant 2-simplex has boundary [p] - [p] + [p] = [p]. So for n=1 (odd), [p] is the boundary of the constant 2-simplex. But wait, that would mean [p] is a boundary, hence trivial in H_1. But in general, for any n, the constant n-simplex is a boundary if there's a constant (n+1)-simplex. But the boundary operator applied to a constant (n+1)-simplex σ would be the sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^i σ ∘ δ_i^n. But since σ is constant, all these terms are the same constant (n)-simplex. So the boundary is [sum (-1)^i] [σ]. The sum alternates signs. For even n+1 (so odd n), the sum is 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... which cancels out if n+1 is even. Wait, let's compute:\n\nSum from i=0 to m of (-1)^i. If m is even, like m=2k, sum is 0. If m is odd, sum is 1. Wait, no:\n\nFor m=0: sum=1\n\nm=1: 1-1=0\n\nm=2: 1-1+1=1\n\nm=3: 1-1+1-1=0\n\nSo the sum is 1 if m even, 0 if m odd. Wait, but for a (n+1)-simplex, the boundary operator applied to it gives sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^i [p], where [p] is the constant simplex. So the coefficient is sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^i. That sum is 0 if n+1 is odd (since the number of terms is even: n+2 terms), wait no. Wait, n+1 is the dimension of the simplex. So for a (k)-simplex, the boundary has k+1 terms. So if we have a (k)-simplex, the sum is sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i.\n\nSo if k is even, sum is 1 -1 +1 ... +1 (k+1 terms). For k even, k+1 is odd. For example, k=2: sum is 1 -1 +1 =1. k=1: sum=1-1=0.\n\nSo if we have a (k)-simplex (constant), its boundary is sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i [p]. So:\n\nIf k is even (k=2m), then sum is 1 -1 +1 ... +1 (total 2m+1 terms) which is 1.\n\nIf k is odd (k=2m+1), sum is 1 -1 +1 ... -1 (2m+2 terms) which is 0.\n\nTherefore, the boundary of a constant (k)-simplex is:\n\n- If k is even: [p]\n\n- If k is odd: 0\n\nSo, for example, if we take a constant 1-simplex (k=1), its boundary is 0. A constant 2-simplex (k=2) has boundary [p].\n\nTherefore, in the chain complex, the constant n-simplex [p] is a boundary if there exists a (n+1)-simplex whose boundary is [p]. That would require that the boundary of the (n+1)-simplex equals [p]. From above, the boundary of a constant (n+1)-simplex is:\n\nIf n+1 is even (i.e., n is odd), then the boundary is [p]. Therefore, for odd n, [p] is the boundary of the constant (n+1)-simplex, hence [p] is a boundary in C_n(Y), so [p] = 0 in H_n(Y). Therefore, the induced map f_* takes any cycle in H_n(X) to a multiple of [p], which is zero in H_n(Y) when n is odd.\n\nBut for even n, the boundary of a constant (n+1)-simplex (which has dimension even+1 = odd) would be zero, as when k is odd (k = n+1), sum is zero. Therefore, [p] is not a boundary in the even case. So how do we handle that?\n\nWait, but the problem is about H_n(Y). If Y is any space, and [p] is a cycle in C_n(Y) (since the boundary of [p] is zero when n is even, because for a constant n-simplex, when n is even, the boundary would be sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i [p]. If n is even, then n+1 terms (since i from 0 to n). If n is even, n+1 is odd. So sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i [p] = [p]*(1 -1 +1 -1 + ... +1). Since the number of terms is odd, the sum is [p]. Wait, but earlier conclusion was different. Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me recompute:\n\nFor a constant n-simplex σ, which is a singular n-simplex that maps everything to a point p in Y. Then, the boundary ∂σ is sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i σ ∘ δ_i, where δ_i is the face map. But since σ is constant, all σ ∘ δ_i are the same constant (n-1)-simplex at p. Therefore, ∂σ = sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i [p], where [p] is the constant (n-1)-simplex.\n\nSo the coefficient is sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i. Let's compute this sum:\n\nsum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i = (1 - (-1)^{n+1}) / (1 - (-1)) ) = (1 + (-1)^n)/2 * 2 = 1 + (-1)^n. Wait, no, that formula isn't correct. Let me compute manually.\n\nFor n even: n = 2k. Then sum is 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... +1 (n+1 terms). Since n is even, n+1 is odd. The sum alternates starting with 1, so for 2k+1 terms: 1 -1 +1 ... +1. Number of terms is odd, so pairs: k pairs of (1 -1) = 0, plus the last term 1. So sum is 1.\n\nFor n odd: n = 2k+1. Then sum is 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... -1 (n+1 = 2k+2 terms). So pairs: (1 -1) + ... + (1 -1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the boundary of a constant n-simplex σ is:\n\n- If n is even: ∂σ = [p] (the constant (n-1)-simplex)\n- If n is odd: ∂σ = 0\n\nWait, this is reversed compared to before. Wait, n here is the dimension of the simplex. So let me clarify:\n\nIf σ is a constant (n)-simplex (dimension n), then ∂σ = sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i [p], where [p] is a constant (n-1)-simplex.\n\nThen, the coefficient sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i is:\n\n- If n is even (n = 2k), then sum = 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... +1 (2k+1 terms) = 1\n- If n is odd (n = 2k+1), sum = 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... -1 (2k+2 terms) = 0\n\nTherefore, ∂σ = [p] if n is even, and 0 if n is odd.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory to the earlier thought. Let's check with n=1 (a 1-simplex). Then ∂σ = [p] - [p] = 0. Wait, but according to the above, n=1 is odd, so sum is 0. Yes, that's correct. For n=2 (even), ∂σ = [p] - [p] + [p] = [p]. Wait, but a 2-simplex's boundary should be three terms: each face. But since all faces are constant, the boundary is [p] - [p] + [p] = [p]. But in reality, the boundary of a 2-simplex should be a cycle. Hmm, but here we're dealing with a constant 2-simplex. So the boundary is [p] - [p] + [p] = [p], which is not a cycle unless [p] is itself a boundary. Wait, but [p] here is a 1-simplex. Wait, but if we consider the boundary of [p] (as a 1-simplex), it would be [p]_0 - [p]_0 = 0. So [p] is a 1-cycle. But in homology, it depends on whether it's a boundary. So if [p] is a boundary of a 2-simplex, then [p] would be zero in H_1. But the constant 2-simplex has boundary [p], so [p] is a boundary if there exists a 2-simplex whose boundary is [p]. But the constant 2-simplex does exactly that. Therefore, [p] is a boundary in C_1(Y), hence trivial in H_1(Y). Therefore, for n=1 (odd), [p] is zero in homology. But wait, according to the calculation above, ∂σ = [p] when σ is a 2-simplex. So [p] = ∂σ, hence [p] is a boundary. Therefore, in H_1(Y), [p] is zero. So for n=1 (odd), the constant 1-simplex is a boundary.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2 (even), a constant 2-simplex has boundary [p], which is a 1-cycle. But to see if [p] is a boundary, we need a 2-simplex. But the constant 2-simplex's boundary is [p], so [p] is a boundary. Wait, no: if σ is a constant 3-simplex (n=3), then its boundary is sum_{i=0}^3 (-1)^i [p] = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0. So [p] in dimension 2 would be the boundary of a 3-simplex? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, if n=2 (even), the boundary of the constant 2-simplex is [p]_1. To have [p]_1 be a boundary, there needs to be a 2-chain whose boundary is [p]_1. The constant 2-simplex σ has boundary [p]_1. Therefore, [p]_1 = ∂σ, so [p]_1 is a boundary. Hence, in H_1(Y), [p]_1 is zero. Wait, but this contradicts previous reasoning. No, wait, H_1(Y) is cycles modulo boundaries. A 1-cycle is a 1-chain whose boundary is zero. But [p]_1 is a 1-cycle since its boundary is zero (as a 1-simplex, its boundary is [p]_0 - [p]_0 = 0). But [p]_1 is also a boundary (from the 2-simplex), so it's zero in H_1(Y). Wait, this seems to suggest that regardless of n, the constant n-simplex [p]_n is a boundary if n is odd? Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, for a constant n-simplex [p]_n:\n\n- If n is even, then ∂[p]_n = [p]_{n-1} (since sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i =1)\n- If n is odd, then ∂[p]_n =0\n\nTherefore, [p]_n is a cycle if n is odd (since ∂[p]_n =0). If n is even, [p]_n is not a cycle (since its boundary is [p]_{n-1}).\n\nBut in homology, we are interested in cycles modulo boundaries. So for even n, [p]_n is not a cycle, so it's not in Z_n. For odd n, [p]_n is a cycle. But is it a boundary? For that, we need to check if there's an (n+1)-chain whose boundary is [p]_n.\n\nConsider a constant (n+1)-simplex σ. Then ∂σ = sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^i [p]_n. The coefficient is sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^i. If n is odd, then n+1 is even. As before, sum_{i=0}^{even-1} (-1)^i = 0. Therefore, ∂σ=0. Therefore, σ is a cycle, but doesn't help in expressing [p]_n as a boundary.\n\nWait, maybe I need a different approach. The key point is that the constant map factors through the inclusion of a point into Y. The induced map in homology factors through the homology of the point, which is zero in degrees >0. Therefore, the composition H_n(X) → H_n({point}) → H_n(Y) must be zero, since H_n({point})=0. Therefore, regardless of even or odd n, the induced map is zero. Hence, the user might be overcomplicating by splitting into even and odd cases. However, the user's approach is trying to use chain-level arguments, which might be necessary for a detailed proof.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that the induced map f_* is zero for n>0 when f is constant. The assumptions are:\n\n- f: X → Y is a constant map.\n- We need to consider the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) for n > 0.\n\nThe user is trying to use the fact that for odd n, the constant n-simplex [p] is a boundary, hence f_* is zero. For even n, they need another approach. However, the general proof using the fact that H_n(point) = 0 for n>0 gives the result immediately. But maybe the user is working in a context where they need to use chain-level reasoning.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f: X → Y is a constant map.\n- Consider the induced homomorphism on homology f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y).\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f_* is the zero homomorphism for all n > 0.\n\nBut in the original question, the user mentions for odd n it's OK because [p]_n = ∂[p]_{n+1}, but for even n, they don't see how. So maybe the assumptions should include that for odd n, [p]_n is a boundary, and the problem is to handle even n. But perhaps the problem is to prove f_* is zero for all n>0, regardless of parity.\n\nIn any case, to structure it according to the format, we need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nOriginal question:\nTitle: Constant maps induce zero homomorphism\nQuestion: It seems reasonable for me that if f:X→Y is the constant map then f_{*}:H_{n}(X)→H_{n}(Y) is the zero map for n>0. But I don't see how to prove this. If n is odd then it is OK as if [p]_{n} denote the class of unique map from Δ^{n}→Y then for odd n, [p]_{n}=∂[p]_{n+1}. How to show for even n?\n\nSo assumptions extracted:\n- f: X → Y is a constant map.\n- For odd n, the class [p]_n in H_n(Y) is the boundary of [p]_{n+1}.\n- Need to show f_* is zero for even n.\n\nBut actually, the user is assuming that for odd n, [p]_n is a boundary, hence zero in homology, hence f_* is zero. For even n, they need to show [p]_n is zero. The problem is to show that for even n, the induced map is zero.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- f: X → Y is the constant map.\n- For each singular n-simplex σ in X, f∘σ is the constant singular n-simplex in Y.\n- For odd n, the constant singular n-simplex in Y is a boundary.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero homomorphism for even n.\n\nBut maybe the original problem is just to prove f_* is zero for all n>0, with the user having handled odd n and needing help with even n.\n\nBut to structure it as per the example, we need to list each assumption line by line.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n- f: X → Y is a constant map.\n- The induced homomorphism f_* is considered for n > 0.\n- For odd n, the image of any n-cycle under f_* is a boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero homomorphism for even n.\n\nBut maybe more precise. The user's question is about showing that when f is constant, f_* is zero for all n>0, and they have a method for odd n but not even. So the assumptions are the general ones for the problem, not the partial progress.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a constant map,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero map.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about even n, but the problem as stated is general. However, the example given in the original instruction had assumptions like \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, perhaps the assumptions should be as per the general problem, not the user's partial progress.\n\nBut following the example, where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original. Wait, no: in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's strange. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \night) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \night)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem should not have added \"n is divisible by 7\". Perhaps the example was wrong, but the instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So maybe the task is to extract the core assumptions and problem, possibly correcting if needed.\n\nBut in the current case, the original problem is about constant maps inducing zero in homology for n>0. The user mentions that for odd n, they can see it because the class [p]_n is a boundary, but not for even n. So perhaps the assumptions should include that for odd n, [p]_n is a boundary, and the problem is to show for even n. But that's part of the user's attempt, not the original problem.\n\nWait, the original problem is the question title and body. The title is \"Constant maps induce zero homomorphism\", and the body is asking how to prove that for the constant map f, f_* is zero for n>0, with partial progress for odd n.\n\nSo the core problem is to prove that if f is constant, then f_* is zero for all n>0. The user's thoughts about odd and even are part of their attempt, but the problem itself doesn't have those as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a constant map,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero map.\n\nBut the example given in the instruction seems to have added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but it wasn't stated. But no, the original problem states \"for every integer n\". Therefore, the example might be incorrectly formatted. But the user might want the assistant to follow their example, even if it's incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the task is to extract from the Math Stack Exchange question the assumptions and problem, filtering unrelated info. The user's question says that f is constant, and they want to prove f_* is zero for n>0. The user's thoughts about odd and even n are their own attempts, not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a constant map,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero map.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions included conditions on n (divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't. This suggests that maybe the assistant is supposed to infer hidden assumptions. But that's risky. Alternatively, the example might be an exception, and normally, the assumptions are explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is to prove that for a constant map f, f_* is zero for n>0. There are no additional assumptions; it's a general statement. However, the user's attempt splits into cases for even and odd n. So the formatted problem should reflect the general case, not the user's approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a constant map,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero map.\n\nBut according to the example, which added an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps the assistant is supposed to include any assumptions made in the problem statement. However, the original problem here doesn't have extra assumptions; the user is asking for a general proof. The user's own attempt considers odd and even n, but that's part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the minimal assumptions from the problem statement:\n\nAssumption:\nf: X → Y is a constant map,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the induced homomorphism f_*: H_n(X) → H_n(Y) is the zero map.",
