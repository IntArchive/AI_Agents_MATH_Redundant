    "Content": "$R(t) \\cdot R'(t) = 0$, which is what every source I can find tells me. Even though I understand the proof I don't understand the underlying concept. If $R(t)\\cdot R'(t) = 0$, then $R'(t)$ is orthogonal to $R(t)$, right? But you use the same derivative to find the tangent of a curve. Then somehow if you differentiate the tangent itself, you get the normal to the curve. I really can't wrap my head around this. Could someone help me understand?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to assume that you mean to ask why the derivative of a fixed length vector is perpendicular to the vector itself. Here's the idea: $$\\vec{r}(t)\\cdot\\vec{r}'(t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d}{dt}(\\vec{r}(t)\\cdot\\vec{r}(t)) = 0.$$ If you want to think about why it is true, think about an object rotating on a circle around the origin. Draw some diagrams to figure out what the position and velocity vectors are. Position points outward radially if we imagine the center of the circle is the origin of the $xy$ plane. Velocity is the rate of change of position. If you consider the average velocity over some interval of time, it would be a secant vector (if you want to call it that). As you take a limit, the secant vector will become a vector tangent to the circle. See the images below. (Note that there are length considerations for $v_{\\text{avg}}$ that I am ignoring, but that's not super important for this heuristic argument.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is confused about why the derivative of a vector is orthogonal to the vector itself, given that the derivative is also used to find the tangent. Then, differentiating the tangent gives the normal. Hmm, where's the disconnect here?\n\nFirst, the original statement is that R(t) · R'(t) = 0 implies they're orthogonal. But wait, when do we have R(t) · R'(t) = 0? Oh, right, that's when the magnitude of R(t) is constant. Because if ||R(t)|| is constant, then the derivative of R(t)·R(t) is 2R(t)·R'(t) = 0, so their dot product is zero. So maybe the user is assuming this holds for any vector function, but actually it's only true when the vector has constant length.\n\nBut the user is talking about the derivative being the tangent vector. In the case of a position vector, say for a curve, the derivative R'(t) is indeed the tangent vector. But that doesn't necessarily mean R(t) and R'(t) are orthogonal unless the position vector has constant magnitude. For example, in circular motion, the position vector has constant magnitude, so the derivative (velocity) is tangent and orthogonal. But if the curve isn't a circle, then R(t) and R'(t) aren't orthogonal.\n\nSo the confusion might be conflating the general case with a specific case where ||R(t)|| is constant. The user might have seen this property in the context of circular motion or unit vectors, but it's not universally true for all vector functions.\n\nAlso, the user mentions differentiating the tangent to get the normal. That's part of the Frenet-Serret formulas, where you have the tangent vector T, then its derivative is related to the normal vector N. But the derivative of T is only orthogonal to T if the magnitude of T is constant, which it is when it's a unit tangent vector. So again, this relies on the fact that T is a unit vector, so its derivative is orthogonal.\n\nPutting this together, the key assumption here is that the vector R(t) has constant magnitude. Without that, R(t) · R'(t) isn't necessarily zero. The problem in the original statement likely assumes that ||R(t)|| is constant, even if it's not explicitly stated. The user's confusion comes from not recognizing that this orthogonality only holds under the constant magnitude condition.\n\nSo to structure the problem, the assumption should be that the vector R(t) has constant magnitude. Then the problem is to prove that R(t) and R'(t) are orthogonal. The rest of the user's questions about tangent and normal vectors relate to this assumption in specific contexts like unit vectors or curves with constant speed parametrization.",
