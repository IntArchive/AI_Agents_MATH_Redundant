    "Content": "How to prove that for some $k, n_0$, for all $n \\ge n_0$ it is never the case that all integers in $\\{n, n+1, \\dots, n + \\lfloor (\\log{n})^k \\rfloor\\}$ have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity? I can prove that for any $\\epsilon \\gt 0$, there exists $n_0$ such that for $n \\ge n_0$ not all integers in $\\{ n, \\dots, n + \\lfloor n^\\epsilon \\rfloor \\}$ have the same number of prime factors: assuming that they all have $x$ prime factors, we must have $x \\gt \\log_2{n^\\epsilon} = \\epsilon \\cdot \\log_2{n}$ because the number in the interval divisible by the largest power of $2$ has at least that many factors.  So the smallest prime factor of any number in that range is at most $n^\\frac{1}{x} \\le n^{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\log_2{n}}} = 2^{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}$ which is constant, and for sufficiently large $n$ we have a contradiction.  I think the same argument might work for even smaller intervals like $\\{n, n+1, \\dots, \\lfloor n+n^\\frac{1}{\\log{\\log{n}}} \\rfloor\\}$. The harder problem with $(\\log{n})^k$-size intervals is implied by Cramér's conjecture (since with $k \\gt 2$ there would always be a prime and a non-prime) but not vice-versa and it seems like it might be tractable given that I can solve the $n^\\epsilon$-size case.  How to prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The problem is difficult and there are only partial results. For example Heath-Brown showed that $$\\Omega\\left(n\\right)=\\Omega\\left(n+1\\right)$$ for infinite $n$ (Heath-Brown, A parity problem for sieve theory, Mathematika, 29, p. 1-6, 1982), where $\\Omega(*)$ is the function that count the prime divisors with multiplicity. But is quite easy show that your sequence is rare (if exists). In fact, assume $$x=\\Omega(n).$$  Using the the fact that $\\Omega(*)$ is a completely additive arithmetic function, i. e. $$\\Omega(ab)=\\Omega(a)+\\Omega(b),\\,a,b\\geq1,$$ we have $$\\underset{k=n}{\\overset{n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor }{\\sum}}\\Omega\\left(k\\right)=\\Omega\\left(n\\left(n+1\\right)\\cdots\\left(n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right)$$and from hypothesis $$\\underset{k=n}{\\overset{n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor }{\\sum}}\\Omega\\left(k\\right)=x\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor +1\\right)$$so$$\\Omega\\left(n\\right)=x=\\frac{\\Omega\\left(n\\left(n+1\\right)\\cdots\\left(n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right)}{\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor +1\\right)}.$$Now, on LHS we have $$\\Omega\\left(n\\right)\\sim\\log\\left(\\log\\left(n\\right)\\right)$$as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ and on RHS $$\\frac{\\Omega\\left(n\\left(n+1\\right)\\cdots\\left(n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right)}{\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor +1\\right)}\\sim\\frac{\\log\\left(\\sum_{k=n}^{n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor }\\log\\left(k\\right)\\right)}{\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor +1}\\sim\\frac{\\log\\left(n\\log\\left(n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right)}{\\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}}=\\frac{\\log\\left(n\\right)+\\log\\left(\\log\\left(n+\\left\\lfloor \\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}\\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right)}{\\log\\left(n\\right)^{k}}$$which tend to $0$ if $k>1$ and $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this question and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filtering out unrelated info and structuring the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the original question is about proving that for some k and n_0, all integers in the interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} do not all have the same number of prime factors (with multiplicity) when n ≥ n_0. The user mentions they can handle the case where the interval size is n^ε but struggles with the (log n)^k case. They also mention Cramér's conjecture relates but the problem might be solvable without it.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions list each condition applied to one object. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, the key assumptions would be about the interval length being (log n)^k, n being sufficiently large (n ≥ n0), and maybe the counting of prime factors with multiplicity. But the problem statement itself is to prove that such an interval can't have all numbers with the same number of prime factors.\n\nWait, the user says \"for some k, n0\" and \"for all n ≥ n0\". So the assumptions would include that k and n0 exist, and that n is ≥ n0. But the problem is to show that in intervals of length floor((log n)^k), starting at n, not all numbers have the same number of prime factors. The user also mentions that their existing argument works for n^ε intervals but not for the log-based ones. They suspect it might be related to Cramér but think it's tractable.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- Let k be a positive integer.\n- Let n0 be a positive integer.\n- For all n ≥ n0.\n- The interval considered is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)}.\n- All numbers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that this is never the case. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is posed. The problem statement is to show that such a scenario is impossible. Therefore, the assumptions would be the existence of k and n0, the range of n, and the structure of the interval. However, the example given earlier lists the assumptions as properties or conditions applied to one object each. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, each line should be a single condition on a single object.\n\nLet me parse the problem again: \"Prove that for some k, n0, for all n ≥ n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\"\n\nSo the problem is to show the existence of k and n0 such that for all n ≥ n0, the interval of length (log n)^k doesn't have all numbers with same prime factor count. The assumptions would then be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥ n0.\n- The interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)}.\n- Each integer in the interval has the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this last assumption (all same number of prime factors) leads to a contradiction, hence it's never the case. So perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the negation. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions listed were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem, not including the thing to be proved. Wait, but in the example, the user had added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, the example might be incorrect. Let me check: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was wrong, but the user provided it as an example. Hmm, that complicates things. Because if the example is wrong, then following it might lead to errors. But according to the user's example, the assumptions include conditions that may not be in the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. The added assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. So maybe the example has an error. Therefore, the user's example might be incorrect, but we have to follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions that are given in the problem. But the problem in the example is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions include n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would mean that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for all integers n. So that example is incorrect. But since the user provided it, we have to follow their format, even if the example is flawed.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the user's task is to list assumptions line by line, each applying to one object. The problem is to prove that for some k and n0, all intervals of size (log n)^k starting at n ≥n0 have numbers with differing prime factor counts.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥ n0.\n- The interval considered is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)}.\n- All integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a scenario never occurs, i.e., that the last assumption leads to a contradiction. However, in the example, the assumptions included conditions that were part of the problem statement, not the hypothesis to be contradicted. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's modifying the original problem. So perhaps the user wants to extract the necessary assumptions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. But in the current problem, the problem is to show that for some k and n0, for all n ≥n0, the interval doesn't have all same prime factors. So the assumptions would be the existence of k and n0, and the interval structure, but the problem is to show the negation of the uniform prime factor count.\n\nBut I think the correct approach here is to list the given conditions as assumptions. However, the example seems to have added an extra condition (divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, which might be a mistake. Given that, perhaps the user wants to list the conditions that are given in the problem, even if they are part of the \"for all\" quantifier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should be the hypotheses under which the problem is to be solved. For instance, in the example, maybe the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. So that might be a mistake. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they want us to list all conditions that are mentioned, even if they are part of the problem's quantifiers.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best way is to list as assumptions:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥ n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n- All integers in this interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a scenario is impossible, i.e., that there exists k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the interval does not have all same number of prime factors. However, the problem statement as given is \"Prove that for some k, n0, for all n ≥n0 it is never the case that all integers in the interval have the same number of prime factors.\"\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement, which include the existence of k and n0, and the structure of the interval, and the problem is to show the non-uniformity of prime factors. But the example seems to have listed the assumptions as the properties of the objects in the problem. For instance, in the example, n is an integer (which is part of the \"for every integer n\" in the original problem), and n is divisible by 7 (which wasn't in the original problem but was added as an assumption). So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but given that, for the current problem, we need to list:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥ n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n- All integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such k and n0 exist so that the last condition is never true. But perhaps the assumptions should only list the given conditions, not the conclusion. The example's assumptions included the divisibility by 7 which was not in the original problem, suggesting that perhaps the user wants to include any hidden assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the example was supposed to have the assumption that n is an integer (from the original problem's \"for every integer n\"), and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under that assumption. But the original example's formatted problem added an extra assumption, which may be incorrect.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to list the explicit conditions given in the problem statement. The problem says: \"for some k, n0, for all n ≥n0\", so the assumptions are that k and n0 exist, n is ≥n0, and the interval has length floor((log n)^k). The problem is to show that all numbers in the interval don't have the same number of prime factors. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), so here, the assumptions should be about n, k, n0, and the interval.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove that \"it is never the case that all integers in [...] have the same number of prime factors\", the assumptions leading to the problem would be:\n\n- Let k be a positive integer.\n- Let n0 be a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n\nBut the problem is to show that in such intervals, not all numbers have the same number of prime factors. However, the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's quantifiers (n is an integer) and an extra one (n divisible by 7). If we follow that, then here the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥n0.\n- The interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)}.\n- All integers in the interval have the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this situation never occurs, i.e., that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the last condition (all same number of prime factors) is false. So perhaps the problem statement should be \"Prove that there exist k, n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line would state the problem as given, and the assumptions are the conditions. But the example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which was to prove for every integer n. That suggests that perhaps the assumptions should include any conditions needed, even if they are part of the universal quantifier. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n- All integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the above conditions lead to a contradiction (i.e., such intervals cannot exist).\n\nBut the original problem statement is to prove that it is never the case that all integers in the interval have the same number of prime factors. So the problem line would be as stated, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem (existence of k, n0, etc.), but perhaps the user wants each assumption as a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions should only include the conditions that are given without being part of the proof's conclusion. For example, the interval's definition, the quantification of n, k, n0, etc.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the best way is to list each assumption as per the problem's given conditions, breaking them into single lines:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nFor all integers n ≥ n0,\nThe interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)},\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that such k and n0 exist such that the above is never true.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is to prove that for some k and n0, for all n ≥n0, the interval does not have all same prime factors. So the assumptions would be the conditions that are given (the interval structure, the existence of k and n0, n being ≥n0), and the problem is to show the impossibility of uniform prime factors.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that in such intervals, not all numbers have the same number of prime factors. So the problem line would be: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line should just restate the problem, so maybe the assumptions are the parts that are given, and the problem is the question. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to extract the conditions on the variables. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all n ≥n0.\n- The interval has length floor((log n)^k).\n\nBut the problem is to prove that in such intervals, not all numbers have the same number of prime factors. So structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ n0,\nThe interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)},\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that such k and n0 exist so that the above assumptions lead to a contradiction, i.e., it is never the case.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is to prove that such k and n0 exist so that for all n ≥n0, the interval does not have uniform prime factors. So the problem line should be as stated, and the assumptions are the conditions given. However, the example included an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Given that inconsistency, perhaps the user wants us to list the assumptions as the conditions that the problem imposes, which includes the interval structure and the existence of k and n0.\n\nGiven the user's example, despite its possible error, the way to proceed is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ n0,\nThe interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered,\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥ n0, the above conditions lead to a contradiction (i.e., such uniform intervals do not exist).\n\nBut the original problem states it as \"Prove that for some k, n0, for all n ≥n0 it is never the case that all integers in [...] have the same number of prime factors.\" So the problem line is exactly that. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ n0,\nThe interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered,\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that such k and n0 exist. The assumptions listed include k and n0 being positive integers, n being integer and ≥n0, and the interval structure. But the problem is to prove the existence of k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the uniformity doesn't hold. So the assumptions should include the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to prove the existence.\n\nBut according to the example, even though the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user wants to list all conditions on the variables, including their quantification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should be the conditions that are universally quantified, and the problem is the existential statement. However, this is getting too tangled. Given the user's example, even if it's flawed, the best approach is to mirror their structure. In their example, the original problem was universally quantified over n, and the formatted assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, which is incorrect. But since the user provided that example, we have to follow it.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥ n0.\n- The interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)}.\n- All integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the above assumptions lead to a contradiction (i.e., it is never the case that all integers in the interval have the same number of prime factors).\n\nBut the problem statement as given is exactly that. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ n0,\nThe interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)},\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut according to the user's example, perhaps the problem line should be the original problem's statement, and the assumptions are the conditions extracted. However, the example added an extra assumption (divisible by 7), but the original problem didn't have that. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- k is a positive integer.\n- n0 is a positive integer.\n- For all integers n ≥n0.\n- The interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that in such intervals, not all numbers have the same number of prime factors. But the example included an assumption about the number being divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list as assumptions the conditions that are part of the problem's premise. In this case, the problem is to show that for some k and n0, for all n ≥n0, the interval of size (log n)^k doesn't have uniform prime factors. The assumptions would then be the existence of k and n0, and the structure of the interval. But how to break that into lines?\n\nPerhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThere exists a positive integer k,\nThere exists a positive integer n0,\nFor all integers n ≥n0,\nThe interval {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that all integers in the interval do not have the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nBut that changes the problem's original statement. The original problem is to prove the existence of k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, the interval does not have uniform prime factors. Therefore, the problem statement is exactly that, and the assumptions are the existence of k and n0 and the interval structure.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. The original problem's divisibility by 91 requires that 7 and 13 divide A(n). So perhaps the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was to handle the divisibility by 7 part, but the example's formatting might have been incorrect.\n\nGiven the confusion and the user's example, perhaps the best way is to list the assumptions as each line addressing one property of one object, even if they are part of the problem's quantifiers. So:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn is greater than or equal to n0,\nThe interval from n to n + floor((log n)^k) is considered,\nAll integers in this interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that such k and n0 exist so that this situation never occurs.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove the existence of k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case. So the problem line would be as stated in the original question.\n\nPutting it all together, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer,\nn0 is a positive integer,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ n0,\nThe interval is {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)},\nAll integers in the interval have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist k and n0 such that for all n ≥n0, it is never the case that all integers in {n, n+1, ..., n + floor((log n)^k)} have exactly the same number of prime factors counted with multiplicity.",
