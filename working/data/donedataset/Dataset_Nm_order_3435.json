    "Content": "1. On the internet, it is suggested that \n$$\nX_t=\\left(\\int_0^t X_s \\;ds\\right)\\;dW_{t}\n$$\nis a martingale, but not a Markov process. I understand that the process \n$$\nI_t(C)=\\int_0^t C_s \\; dW_s$$\nis a martingale, but I don't see $X_t$ as an Ito's integral. In order to show it is a martingale but not a Markov process, I want to show that \n$$\nE(X_t\\mid\\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=X_{t-1}\\neq E(X_t\\mid\\sigma(X_{t-1})).\n$$\nI don't know how to take the expecation in this case. Other counterexamples available online might be wrong. (Or, I could\nbe wrong.) 2. Invalid counterexample: Let $e(t)$ be a random variable which is not independent of\n$y(0)$ and \n$$\ny(t)=y(t-1)+e(t)-E{[}e(t)|F(t-1){]}.\n$$ \nThen y(t) is a martingale but it is not a Markov process. I will show that it is both a martingale and a Markov process. Define $X_{t}$ as \n$$\nX_{t}=X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\n$$ Then, $\\{X_{t}\\}$ is a martingale because\n$$\nE(X_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1})  =  E\\left(X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\\bigg|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\n  =  E(X_{t-1}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1})+E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)-E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\n = E(X_{t-1}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1})\n  =  X_{t-1}\n$$ However, it is also a Markov process.\n$$\nE(X_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})) =  E\\left(X_{t-1}+e_{t}-E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\\bigg|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)\n  =  E(X_{t-1}|\\sigma(X_{t-1}))+E\\left(e_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)-E\\left(E\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\\bigg|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)\n$$ Since $\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\subset\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$, by the towering property,\n$$\nE\\left(\\left(e_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1}\\right)\\bigg|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)=E\\left(e_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right).\n$$ Thus\n$$E(X_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1}))  =  E(X_{t-1}|\\sigma(X_{t-1}))+E\\left(e_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)-E\\left(e_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\\right)\n  =  E(X_{t-1}|\\sigma(X_{t-1})\n$$ Since $X_{t-1}$ is $\\sigma(X_{t-1})$-measurable, $E(X_{t-1}|\\sigma(X_{t-1}))=X_{t-1}$. Thus $$\nE(X_{t}|\\sigma(X_{t-1}))=X_{t-1}=E(X_{t}|\\mathcal{F}_{t-1})\n$$\nHence $\\{X_{t}\\}$ is also a Markov process. 3. Invalid counterexample from the textbook answer key. Alison Etheridge's textbook gives an example: \n$$\nS_{n+1}=S_{n}+\\xi_{n+1}\n$$ \nwhere $\\xi_{n}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ and $\\{\\xi_{n}\\}_{n\\geq0}$ are iid. Then, $$\nP\\left(S_{n+1}=k+1\\bigg|S_{n}=k\\right)=p \\text{and }P\\left(S_{n+1}=k-1\\bigg|S_{n}=k\\right)=1-p.\n$$\nThe author claims that $\\left\\{ S_{n}\\right\\} $ is a Markov process. Then in the homework answer key, someone gives $\\left\\{ Z_{n}\\right\\}$ as a counterexample of a martingale not being a Markov process:\n$\n\\displaystyle{Z_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\xi_{i}}\n$ \nwhere $P(\\xi_{i}=1)=\\frac{1}{2}=P(\\xi_{i}=-1)$. Obviously, $Z_{n+1}=Z_{n}+\\xi_{n+1}.$ So what's the difference between this counterexample and the example? Moreover, given $P(\\xi_{i}=1)=\\frac{1}{2}=P(\\xi_{i}=-1)$, I think\nis both $\\left\\{ Z_{n}\\right\\}$ is both a martingale and a Markov process.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is a pervasive mistake in your post, possibly explaining your trouble, which is to believe that $(X_t)_{t\\geqslant0}$ being a Markov process means that $\\mathrm E(X_t\\mid \\mathcal F_{t-1})=\\mathrm E(X_t\\mid X_{t-1})$ for every $t\\geqslant1$ , where $\\mathcal F_t=\\sigma(X_s;0\\leqslant s\\leqslant t)$ for every $t\\geqslant0$ . This is not the definition of the Markov property . The Markov property is the assumption that, for every $t\\geqslant1$ , the conditional distribution of $X_t$ conditionally on $\\mathcal F_{t-1}$ depends on $X_{t-1}$ only. Obviously, if the conditional distribution of $X_t$ conditionally on $\\mathcal F_{t-1}$ is the conditional distribution of $X_t$ conditionally on $X_{t-1}$ (Markov), then the same is true for the conditional expectations (the property you think is Markov), but the converse is not true. For a counterexample, assume that $(Z_t)_{t\\geqslant2}$ is independent, integrable, centered, non constant (say, with a standard normal distribution), and independent on $X_0$ . Let $X_1=X_0=1$ and $X_t=X_{t-1}+Z_tX_{t-2}$ for every $t\\geqslant2$ . Then $\\mathrm E(X_t\\mid \\mathcal F_{t-1})=\\mathrm E(X_t\\mid X_{t-1})=X_{t-1}$ for every $t\\geqslant1$ (hence, if $X_0$ is integrable, $(X_t)_{t\\geqslant0}$ is a martingale)  but $(X_t)_{t\\geqslant0}$ is not a Markov process since the conditional distribution of $X_t$ conditionally on $\\mathcal F_{t-1}$ does not depend on $X_{t-1}$ only but on $(X_{t-1},X_{t-2})$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about a specific stochastic process that is a martingale but not a Markov process. They mentioned two parts: first, the process defined by the SDE X_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t, and second, some counterexamples that they think are invalid.\n\nThe main task here is to structure the problem as per the given format. The user provided an example where the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions and restated the problem. So I need to extract the key assumptions from the Stack Exchange question and present the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the question, the user is trying to show that X_t is a martingale but not a Markov process. They mention that X_t isn't an Itô integral, which might be an assumption. Also, they refer to the expectation conditions involving the filtration F_{t-1} and σ(X_{t-1}).\n\nThe user also discusses two counterexamples that they believe are invalid. The first one involves a process defined by X_t = X_{t-1} + e_t - E[e_t | F_{t-1}], which they argue is both a martingale and a Markov process. The second counterexample from a textbook is about Z_n = sum ξ_i, which the user claims is both a martingale and Markov.\n\nSo the assumptions here might include properties of X_t being a martingale but not Markov, the structure of the SDE, and perhaps the invalidity of the given counterexamples. But in the example provided, the assumptions were specific conditions on the variables. Here, the key assumptions would be about the process X_t's definition and the properties it's supposed to have.\n\nWait, the original problem's first part is about X_t being a martingale but not Markov. The user wants to show that E(X_t | F_{t-1}) = X_{t-1} but E(X_t | σ(X_{t-1})) ≠ X_{t-1}. So the assumptions would include the definition of X_t via that SDE, and maybe that the filtration is the natural one for the Wiener process.\n\nAlso, the user is disputing other counterexamples, saying they are invalid. But for the formatting, perhaps we focus on the main problem they're trying to solve, not the discussion of other examples. The main problem is part 1: showing X_t is a martingale but not a Markov process.\n\nSo the Assumptions section should list the conditions given for X_t. The problem is to prove that X_t is a martingale but not a Markov process. The SDE is X_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t. Wait, actually, the SDE is written as dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t? Or is it X_t defined as that integral multiplied by dW_t? The original question has:\n\n$$\nX_t=\\left(\\int_0^t X_s \\;ds\\right)\\;dW_{t}\n$$\n\nBut this notation is a bit unclear. Typically, SDEs are written as dX_t = something. So maybe the user is writing the SDE in differential form as dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t. But that's non-standard because the drift term is an integral over time up to t, which makes it depend on the entire path from 0 to t, not just the current state. That would make the process non-Markovian because the future depends on more than the present state.\n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- X_t is defined by the stochastic differential equation dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t.\n\n- W_t is a Wiener process.\n\n- The filtration F_t is the natural filtration generated by W_t.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that X_t is a martingale with respect to F_t but not a Markov process.\n\nWait, but the user's original question has the equation as X_t = ... which might not be correct notation. Perhaps it's an integral equation. Alternatively, maybe they meant dX_t = (∫₀^t X_s ds) dW_t, which would make X_t a process whose differential is that integral times dW_t. But this is an unusual SDE because the drift is an integral over the past of X_s, which introduces memory, hence non-Markov.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended the process X_t to be the product of the integral and dW_t, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the integral is the integrand in an Itô integral. So X_t = ∫₀ᵗ (∫₀^s X_r dr) dW_s. That would make X_t an Itô process. However, the user says they don't see X_t as an Itô integral. So perhaps the process is defined differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is writing the SDE as X_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t, which is confusing notation. In any case, the key point is that X_t is defined via an equation involving an integral of its past, making it non-Markovian, but still a martingale.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions should include the definition of X_t via this integral equation involving its own history, and the problem is to show it's a martingale but not Markov.\n\nAdditionally, the user's own attempt mentions using the expectation E(X_t | F_{t-1}) = X_{t-1} versus E(X_t | σ(X_{t-1})). So perhaps the assumption is that the filtration is the natural one for the Wiener process.\n\nPutting this together, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- X_t is defined by the equation $$X_t = \\left(\\int_0^t X_s \\, ds\\right) dW_t$$.\n- W_t is a Wiener process.\n- The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is generated by the Wiener process up to time t.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $X_t$ is a martingale with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_t$ but not a Markov process.\n\nBut wait, the equation as written is not standard. Maybe the correct SDE is dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t. That would make sense as an SDE with stochastic differential involving the integral of X_s up to time t. In that case, the process X_t would have dynamics dependent on its entire path, hence non-Markovian.\n\nSo perhaps the assumption is:\n\n- The process X_t satisfies the stochastic differential equation dX_t = \\left( \\int_0^t X_s \\, ds \\right) dW_t.\n\nAlternatively, if the original equation is written as X_t = ... , maybe that's supposed to be the integral form, i.e., X_t = ∫₀ᵗ (∫₀^s X_r dr) dW_s. But the user mentions that X_t is not an Itô integral, so maybe it's defined differently. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written in differential form as dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t, which is different from standard Itô processes where the integrand is adapted. Here, the integrand ∫₀ᵗ X_s ds is an adapted process because it's the integral up to time t. Wait, but the integral ∫₀ᵗ X_s ds is a process that at time t is known, so it's adapted. Therefore, the SDE dX_t = (∫₀ᵗ X_s ds) dW_t would make X_t an Itô process with zero drift and diffusion term ∫₀ᵗ X_s ds. But the diffusion term here depends on the entire path of X_s from 0 to t, making it non-Markovian.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are the definition of X_t via this SDE, the Wiener process, and the natural filtration. The problem is to show it's a martingale (which would follow if the drift is zero, but wait, in this SDE, the drift is zero, so it's a local martingale. But whether it's a true martingale would require additional conditions, like the diffusion term being square-integrable. The user might be assuming that X_t is square-integrable or that the integral term satisfies certain conditions.\n\nBut the original question states that it's suggested on the internet that X_t is a martingale but not Markov. The user is trying to verify this. So the assumptions may just be the definition of X_t as given, and the problem is to prove those two properties.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\nAssumption:\n- X_t is defined by the stochastic differential equation $$dX_t = \\left( \\int_0^t X_s \\, ds \\right) dW_t$$.\n- W_t is a standard Wiener process.\n- The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is the natural filtration generated by W_t.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X_t is a martingale with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_t$ but is not a Markov process.\n\nAlternatively, if the original equation is written without the differential, perhaps as X_t = \\int_0^t \\left( \\int_0^s X_r \\, dr \\right) dW_s. Then the SDE would be dX_t = \\left( \\int_0^t X_s \\, ds \\right) dW_t. Either way, the key is the dependence on the integral up to time t, which introduces memory.\n\nThe user also discusses other counterexamples, but the main problem is part 1. The other parts are the user's analysis of invalid counterexamples, but according to the example given, we should filter out unrelated information. So the formatted problem should focus on part 1 of the original question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the assumptions about X_t's definition via the SDE with the integral term, the Wiener process, and the filtration, and the problem is to prove it's a martingale but not Markov.",
