    "Content": "I have tried to find a proof of the binomial theorem for any power, but I am finding it difficult. One can obviously prove the integer index case using induction, but all of the approaches for ANY power seem to involve calculus usually the Maclaurin series. My point is that surely as the result \n$$\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}$$\nrelies on the binomial theorem when taking the limit, this means that any attempt to prove the binomial theorem using calculus is circular. \nIs there a proof without calculus for ANY power?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $\\alpha\\ge1$. Using Bernoulli's Inequality (which can be proven by induction for integer exponents , and easily extended for rational exponents , then extended by continuity for real exponents), we have for $|h|$ small enough so that $\\frac{\\alpha|h|}{x}\\lt1$,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(x+h)^\\alpha-x^\\alpha}{h}\n&=x^\\alpha\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{h}{x}\\right)^\\alpha-1}{h}\\\\\n&\\ge x^\\alpha\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{\\alpha h}{x}\\right)-1}{h}\\\\[12pt]\n&=\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}\\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nFurthermore, for $|h|$ small enough so that $0\\lt\\frac{\\alpha|h|}{x-|h|}\\lt1$,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{(x+h)^\\alpha-x^\\alpha}{h}\n&=x^\\alpha\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{h}{x}\\right)^\\alpha-1}{h}\\\\\n&=x^\\alpha\\frac{\\frac1{\\left(1-\\frac{h}{x+h}\\right)^\\alpha}-1}{h}\\\\\n&\\le x^\\alpha\\frac{\\frac1{\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha h}{x+h}\\right)}-1}{h}\\\\[9pt]\n&=\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}\\frac{x}{x-(\\alpha-1)h}\\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nThus, using the Squeeze Theorem with $(1)$ and $(2)$, we have\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}x^\\alpha=\\lim_{h\\to0}\\frac{(x+h)^\\alpha-x^\\alpha}{h}=\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}\\tag{3}\n$$ For $\\alpha\\lt1$, we have from $(3)$ that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}x^2=2x$. Then, because $2-\\alpha\\gt1$, the product rule says\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n2x\n&=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}x^{(2-\\alpha)+\\alpha}\\\\\n&=x^{2-\\alpha}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}x^\\alpha+(2-\\alpha)x^{1-\\alpha}x^\\alpha\\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nFinally, $(4)$ and algebra say that\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}x^\\alpha=\\alpha x^{\\alpha-1}\\tag{5}\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the problem is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the original question: The user is asking for a proof of the binomial theorem for any (rational?) power without using calculus. They mention that proofs for any power usually involve Maclaurin series, but they suspect circular reasoning because the derivative of x^n relies on the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, first, the assumptions. The problem is about proving the binomial theorem for any power. The key points here are:\n\n1. The binomial theorem is for any power, not just integers. The original question says \"any power\", but the example they give is about rational index. Wait, the title says \"rational index\", but the question mentions \"ANY power\". Hmm, need to check.\n\nWait, the title is \"Binomial theorem proof for rational index without calculus\". So the problem is specifically about rational exponents. However, the user wrote \"any power\" in the question. But the key here is to focus on the title and the main question. So the assumption is that the exponent is rational. Also, the proof should not involve calculus. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The exponent is a rational number.\n- The proof must not use calculus.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for any power\", but the title specifies \"rational index\". So maybe the user is interested in rational exponents. However, the example given in the problem (the derivative) is general, but the focus is on the binomial theorem expansion for non-integer exponents.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The binomial theorem applies to a rational exponent.\n- The proof must not use calculus methods.\n\nBut the original problem's question says \"for ANY power\", but the title says \"rational index\". So maybe the problem is about generalizing the binomial theorem to any power, particularly rational, without calculus. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The exponent is a rational number.\n2. The proof does not involve calculus.\n\nBut wait, the user's problem statement in their question mentions \"any power\", which could include real exponents, but the title specifies \"rational index\". So the main focus is on rational exponents. However, the user's confusion is about proofs using calculus being circular because the derivative of x^n uses the binomial theorem. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The binomial theorem is to be proven for any (rational) power.\n- The proof must avoid calculus to prevent circular reasoning.\n\nSo, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The exponent in the binomial theorem is a rational number.\n- The proof does not use calculus.\n\nProblem: Prove the binomial theorem for any rational power without using calculus.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the binomial theorem for a rational exponent without calculus. The original question's problem is to find such a proof. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. But in this case, the problem is to prove the binomial theorem for any power (rational) without calculus. The user isn't adding extra conditions but is specifying the requirements for the proof. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The binomial expansion is for a rational exponent.\n- The proof must not involve calculus methods.\n\nBut the problem statement is: Prove the binomial theorem for any rational index without using calculus.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe exponent in the binomial theorem is a rational number,\nThe proof must not use calculus.\n\nProblem:\nProve the binomial theorem for any rational index without using calculus.\n\nI think that's correct. The original problem's title specifies \"rational index\", and the question is about proving it without calculus. The assumptions are the conditions given (rational exponent, no calculus), and the problem is the restatement.",
