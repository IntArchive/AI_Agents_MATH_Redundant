    "Content": "This is an exercise that I am having trouble with. Not for a grade just for practice.  Its an obvious result intuitively but I am having trouble making a rigorous argument. Assume $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $E$.  Prove that for all $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that if the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is less than $\\delta$, the integral of $|f|$ over $A$ is less than $\\varepsilon$.  Here $A$ is a subset of $E$. Anyone have any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we have that $$\\lim_{\\lambda \\to\\infty}\\int_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu = 0.$$ This follows easily since $\\chi_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f| \\le |f| \\in L^1$ and $\\chi_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f| \\to 0$ since $f$, being integrable, is finte almost everywhere. Let $\\epsilon > 0$, then there exists $\\lambda > 0$ such that $$\\int_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}.$$ Choose $\\delta \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{2\\lambda}$ and take any measurable set $A$ such that $\\mu(A) < \\delta$. Then we have $$\\int_A|f|\\ d\\mu = \\int_{A \\cap \\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu + \\int_{A \\cap \\{|f| \\le \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu \\le$$ $$\\le \\int_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu + \\int_{A \\cap \\{|f| \\le \\lambda\\}}\\lambda\\ d\\mu$$ note that this last inequality follows from the fact that $A \\cap \\{|f| > \\lambda\\} \\subset \\{|f| > \\lambda\\}$ and the fact that $|f| \\le \\lambda$ on $A \\cap \\{|f| \\le \\lambda\\}$. Then we are done since $$\\int_{\\{|f| > \\lambda\\}}|f|\\ d\\mu + \\int_{A \\cap \\{|f| \\le \\lambda\\}}\\lambda\\ d\\mu \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + \\delta \\lambda \\le \\epsilon.$$\nThis concludes the proof! :D",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about absolute continuity of the Lebesgue integral. The problem states: Assume f is Lebesgue integrable on E. Prove that for all ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ, then the integral of |f| over A is less than ε, where A is a subset of E.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object.\n\n1. The first assumption is that f is Lebesgue integrable on E. So that's \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\"\n\n2. The problem mentions that A is a subset of E. So another assumption is \"A is a subset of E.\"\n\n3. The Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ. But wait, δ is part of the statement we need to prove, so maybe that's not an assumption but a condition in the implication. The user wants to show that given ε > 0, there exists δ such that if m(A) < δ, then the integral over A is less than ε. So the measure condition is part of the conclusion's hypothesis, not an assumption of the problem setup. Therefore, the main assumptions are just f being integrable on E and A being a subset of E. Wait, but the problem says \"if the Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ\", so A is any subset of E with measure less than δ. So in the problem statement, the only fixed assumptions are that f is integrable on E and that A is a subset of E. The measure of A being less than δ is part of the condition to check for the integral.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions listed were about the variables in the problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So maybe here, the assumptions are:\n\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\n- A is a subset of E.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Assume f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\" So that's the main assumption. The other part is that A is a subset of E. However, in the problem statement, the user is to prove that for any ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for any A subset of E with measure less than δ, the integral over A is less than ε. So the assumptions are only that f is integrable on E. The fact that A is a subset of E is part of the problem's structure, not an assumption per se. Wait, perhaps the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\nBecause the problem says \"Assume f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\" Then the rest is the problem to prove. The fact that A is a subset of E is part of the problem's conclusion: for any A subset of E with measure < δ, the integral is < ε. So maybe in the Assumption section, only \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E\" is listed. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Wait, no, the original problem in the example might have had a different structure. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's confusing because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe the example was modified. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, perhaps in the example, the actual problem was that the user wanted to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. Hmm, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem had a divisibility condition on n. But the original problem as presented in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But perhaps the example was not correctly transcribed. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Hmm. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe problem here is: Assume f is Lebesgue integrable on E. Prove that for all ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that if the Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ, the integral of |f| over A is less than ε. Here A is a subset of E.\n\nSo the explicit assumption given is \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\" The rest is part of the problem to prove. However, the problem mentions that A is a subset of E. So maybe in the assumptions, we need to include that A is a subset of E, but actually, the problem says \"Here A is a subset of E,\" which is part of the problem's statement. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\n- A is a subset of E.\n\nBut the problem's conclusion is that for any ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that if m(A) < δ, then ∫_A |f| < ε. So the assumptions for the problem are only that f is integrable on E. The fact that A is a subset of E is part of the problem's structure, not an assumption. Wait, but the problem states \"Here A is a subset of E,\" so maybe that's an additional condition. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is about f being integrable on E, and A being any subset of E with measure less than δ. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\n2. A is a subset of E.\n\nBut the second point is part of the problem's condition. Wait, the problem says \"if the Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ, then...\", where A is a subset of E. So perhaps \"A is a subset of E\" is a condition on A, not an assumption. But the problem is to prove that for all ε>0, there exists δ>0 such that for any A subset of E with m(A) < δ, the integral is less than ε. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are only that f is integrable on E. The rest is part of the problem statement. Therefore, in the Assumption section, only \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E\" should be listed. The fact that A is a subset of E is part of the problem's conclusion's hypothesis, not an assumption. Wait, but the user wrote in the example that assumptions are for example \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". In that case, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different phrasing. Anyway, perhaps in this case, the correct assumption is just \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E\".\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Assume $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $E$. Prove that for all $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that if the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is less than $\\delta$, the integral of $|f|$ over $A$ is less than $\\varepsilon$. Here $A$ is a subset of $E$.\"\n\nSo the user says \"Assume f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\" Then the rest is the problem to prove. The \"Here A is a subset of E\" is part of the problem's statement. So in the Assumption section, we should list:\n\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\nThat's the only assumption. The fact that A is a subset of E is part of the problem's conclusion: for any A subset of E with measure less than δ, etc. So it's not an assumption but a condition in the implication. Therefore, the Assumption section should have only one bullet point: \"f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\"\n\nWait, but in the example, they included two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Maybe because the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and they added an extra condition. But in this problem, the original assumption is only that f is integrable on E. Therefore, the correct Assumption is just that. The problem then is to prove the statement about ε and δ, where A is a subset of E. So the Problem part should be:\n\nProblem: Prove that for all ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the Lebesgue measure of A (a subset of E) is less than δ, then the integral of |f| over A is less than ε.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be phrased as given, with the assumptions listed separately. Therefore, the correct structured problem is:\n\nAssumption: \n- f is Lebesgue integrable on E.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if the Lebesgue measure of A is less than δ, then ∫_A |f| < ε, where A is a subset of E.\n\nI think that's correct. The key assumption is that f is integrable on E. The rest is part of the problem statement.",
