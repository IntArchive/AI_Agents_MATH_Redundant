    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an alternative to the proof linked to in the comments: Suppose there existed $x \\in X\\setminus f(X)$. Then $x$ has positive distance $d$ from the compact set $f(X)$. Now consider the recursively defined sequence $$x_0 := x, \\qquad x_n := f(x_{n-1}) \\quad \\forall \\, n>0$$ \nWe have $d(x_0, x_n)\\ge d$ for all $n>0$, by assumption on $x$. This implies that we also have $d(x_k, x_{k+n}) = d(x_0, x_n) \\ge d$ for all $k,n>0$ (here we use that $f$ is an isometry). Therefore $d(x_n, x_m) \\ge d$ for all $m\\ne n$, which is in contradiction to sequential compactness of $X$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The title is \"A isometric map in metric space is surjective?\" and the question body mentions that it's a possible duplicate of another question about isometries in R^n. The user then states the problem: Let X be a compact metric space and f be an isometric map from X to X. Prove f is a surjective map.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions two main objects: X and f. \n\nFor X, the assumptions are that X is a compact metric space. That's two properties: being a metric space and being compact. Wait, the original problem says \"Let X be a compact metric space\", so that's one assumption: X is a compact metric space. Then f is an isometric map from X to X. So f is an isometry (which implies it's injective since isometries are always injective). But the problem is to prove f is surjective. \n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had each assumption as one line per property or condition applied to one object. So for the example, they listed n is an integer, then n is divisible by 7 as separate assumptions. So in this case, the objects are X and f. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. X is a compact metric space.\n2. f: X → X is an isometric map.\n\nBut do I need to break down \"compact metric space\" into two parts: metric space and compact? The example didn't split \"integer\" into being a number and being integral, so perhaps keep it as one assumption per object. So X is a compact metric space (one assumption). Then f is an isometric map from X to X (another assumption). That's two assumptions. \n\nWait, but in the example, the user had two assumptions for n: being an integer and being divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the problem states \"Let X be a compact metric space and f be an isometric map...\". So maybe each \"and\" in the original problem might split into separate assumptions. Let me check. The original problem says \"Let X be a compact metric space and f be an isometric map from X to X.\" So that's two separate assumptions: X is a compact metric space; f is an isometric map from X to X. So in the assumptions section, each of these would be separate lines. So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a compact metric space.\n- f: X → X is an isometric map.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is surjective.\n\nNow, the user's example in the original query had a slight discrepancy. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that example might have been incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake there. But perhaps the example was for a different problem. Anyway, in our current problem, we need to stick to the original problem's assumptions. The original problem here states that X is compact metric, and f is an isometry from X to X. The task is to prove f is surjective.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a compact metric space,\nf is an isometric map from X to X.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is a surjective map.\n\nI think that's all. The problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so the assumptions are those two. Each is a separate line, each applies to one object (X and f respectively). The problem is to prove surjectivity. So the formatted problem should look like that.",
