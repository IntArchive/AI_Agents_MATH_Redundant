    "Content": "Here is an integral I derived while evaluating another. It appears to be rather tough, but some here may not be so challenged :) Show that: $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right)$$ $$=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)+\\frac{4\\pi^{3}}{27\\sqrt{3}}-\\frac{2\\pi}{9\\sqrt{3}}\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$ $$=\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)-2\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$ I attempted all kinds of 'starts' to no satisfactory end, but things look promising. There are some mighty sharp folks here that may be better at deriving the solution. I thought perhaps the identity: $$\\frac{\\log^{2}(1-(x-x^{2}))}{x}=2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{H_{n}}{n+1}x^{n}(1-x)^{n+1}$$ or the Beta function could be used if given enough ingenuity. This led me to the no-less-imposing Euler/reciprocal of central binomial coefficients sum below. It would be great to just show the middle sum is equivalent to the right sum: $$1/4\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{H_{n}n\\Gamma^{2}(n)}{(n+1)(2n+1)\\Gamma(2n)}=1/2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{H_{n}}{(n+1)(2n+1)\\binom{2n}{n}}=1/3\\zeta(3)-2/3\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^{3}\\binom{2n}{n}}$$ Is there a general form for $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{H_{n}}{\\binom{2n}{n}}x^{n}?$$ I tried starting with the identity: $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\Gamma^{2}(n)}{\\Gamma(2n)}x^{n-1}=\\frac{4\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{x(4-x)}}$$ and using various manipulations to hammer into the needed form. This, too, turned monstrous. There appears to be a relation to Clausen functions (as with other log integrals such as $\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log(x)}{x^{2}-x+1}dx$ ), to wit: I use Cl for sin and CL for cos Clausen functions $$\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi k}{3})}{k^{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{72}\\left(\\psi_{1}(1/6)+\\psi_{1}(1/3)-\\psi_{1}(2/3)-\\psi_{1}(5/6)\\right)$$ $$=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\psi_{1}(1/3)-\\frac{\\pi^{2}\\sqrt{3}}{9}$$ and $$\\operatorname{Cl}_{3}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)-\\operatorname{Cl}_{3}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\cos(\\frac{\\pi k}{3})}{k^{3}}-2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi k}{3})}{k^{3}}=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)$$ Another approach . I also broke the integral up as such: $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(1-xe^{\\frac{\\pi i}{3}})}{x}dx+2\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log(1-xe^{\\pi i/3})\\log(1-xe^{-\\pi i/3})}{x}dx+\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(1-xe^{-\\pi i/3})}{x}dx$$ The middle integral right of the equal sign is the one that has given me the fit. I think this is a fun and head-scratchin' integral that has led me to other discoveries.  Maybe a generalization could be obtained with other powers of log such as n = 3, 4, etc. I wonder if they can also be evaluated in terms of Clausens and then into closed forms involving $\\zeta(n+1)$ and derivatives of digamma, $\\psi_{n-1}(z)?$ . Another easier one is $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{-\\pi^{2}}{18}=\\frac{-1}{3}\\zeta(2)?$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the problem and the assumptions. The original question is about evaluating a definite integral from 0 to 1 of [log²(x² - x + 1)]/x dx and showing it equals a combination of ζ(3), ψ₁ functions, and Clausen functions. The user also mentions several approaches and related identities they tried.\n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the core problem. Looking at the example provided, the assumptions are specific conditions or properties applied to one object each. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the given problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand involves log squared of a quadratic divided by x. The problem doesn't mention any parameters or conditions except the integral itself. The user didn't specify any particular restrictions, so the main assumption here is the integral's limits and the integrand's form. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer. In this integral problem, are there any implicit assumptions? The integral is over x from 0 to 1, and the integrand is defined in that interval. The log function's argument x² - x + 1 is always positive there, so maybe the integrand is well-defined. But since the problem is to compute the integral, perhaps the only assumption is the integral's bounds and the integrand's expression. However, looking at the example, they listed each assumption line by line. Here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (log²(x² - x + 1))/x.\n\nBut each assumption should address one property or condition. So, first, the integration variable is x, integrated from 0 to 1. Second, the integrand is the square of the natural logarithm of (x² - x + 1) divided by x. However, in the example, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the integral's limits and the integrand's form are necessary. But perhaps in this case, the problem is straightforward, and the main assumption is just the integral's setup. Wait, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's definition. The example had an extra condition (divisible by 7), but here the problem is to compute the integral as given. Therefore, the assumption would be the integral is from 0 to 1, and the integrand is as specified. However, according to the example, each assumption should be one line, one property. So splitting into two:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2} - x + 1)}{x}\\).\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show the equality, so the assumptions are the integral's setup. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the logarithm is natural logarithm, which is standard in such contexts unless specified otherwise. But the user might not need to list that unless specified. The problem statement in the original question uses log without a base, so it's natural logarithm. Maybe that's an assumption. But in the example, the base wasn't mentioned either, so perhaps it's standard. Alternatively, the problem may not have additional assumptions beyond the integral itself. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2} - x + 1)}{x}\\).\n\nEach on a separate line. Then the problem is to show that this integral equals the given expressions. But the original problem has multiple expressions shown as equal to the integral. The user wrote several forms, so the problem statement should include all those forms? Or just the first one? In the example, they kept the problem as the original statement but filtered out unnecessary parts. The user's example had the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem would be \"Show that [integral equals the given combination].\" But the original question lists multiple equalities. The first line is the integral equals 11/9 ζ(3) - π/(72√3)(5ψ₁(1/3)+...), then another form with 4π³/(27√3), another with Cl functions, etc. The problem is to show that the integral equals all these different expressions. But in formatting, the problem should present the core problem. The user might need to condense it. However, the original problem starts with \"Show that:\" followed by multiple expressions. So the problem is to show that the integral equals the first expression, which is then expressed in different equivalent forms. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement is to show the integral equals the first expression, and the other lines are alternative representations. But in the example, they included only the main expression. However, the original problem's first line has the integral equals the first expression, then the user writes \"=\" and another form, etc. So maybe the problem is to show that the integral equals any of these forms. However, to structure the problem, perhaps it's best to present the integral equals the first expression, and note that it can also be expressed in terms of Clausen functions. But the example given by the user included the problem as stated, with multiple forms. Wait, in the example, the original problem had the expression A(n) and the formatted problem included the same expression. Here, the original problem has multiple expressions connected by equality signs, so the formatted problem should include all those? But the user's example only included the main problem line. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo they took the main problem line and adjusted assumptions. In the current case, the original problem's first line is \"Show that: [integral equals expression1] = [expression2] = [expression3] = [expression4]\". So in the formatted problem, should we include all those equalities or just the first one? The example shows that they kept the problem as stated but adjusted the assumptions. So here, the problem would be to show that the integral equals the first expression, which is equal to the others. However, the user's example didn't include alternative forms in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's equal to any of those forms. But given the format, perhaps the problem should be written as the original statement but filtered. The user included multiple equalities in their example's formatted problem. Wait, no, the example only had the main expression. The original problem had \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\", and the formatted version was the same. In the current case, the problem is \"Show that: [integral] = [expr1] = [expr2] = [expr3]\". So to follow the example, perhaps we should take the main problem as \"Show that the integral equals [first expression]\" and then note that it's also equal to other forms. But maybe the user wants the problem to be as concise as possible. Alternatively, the problem can be stated as showing the integral equals the first expression, with the note that it can be expressed in terms of Clausen functions, but the example didn't have such notes. Given the example, the formatted problem should include the main problem line. The user's original question starts with \"Show that: [integral] = [expr1] = [expr2] = [expr3]\". So perhaps the problem should be written as \"Show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx$$ equals any of the following expressions: [list]\". However, the example didn't list multiple expressions but kept the main one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show the integral equals the first expression, and the other equalities are consequences or alternative forms, but in the problem statement, it's sufficient to present the first equality. However, the user's original problem presents multiple equalities connected by equal signs, which might indicate that the problem is to show the integral equals all those forms. But for clarity, maybe the problem should be written as showing the integral equals the first expression, and the rest are alternative representations. However, in the example, the formatted problem kept the original expression. So perhaps we should include all equalities in the problem statement. But the problem line in the example was concise. Given that, maybe the problem should be written as:\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right)$$ and equals other expressions involving Clausen functions.\n\nBut the example didn't have \"and equals...\", so maybe just the first equality. Alternatively, the user's problem as presented includes multiple equalities connected by equals signs. So perhaps the problem is to show that the integral equals the first expression, which is equal to the subsequent ones. So in the problem line, include all the equalities as per the original question. However, the user's example didn't do that. The example had a single expression. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should include the first equality, and the rest can be considered as alternative forms, but not part of the core problem. Alternatively, given that the user's original question includes multiple forms, the problem is to show the integral equals any of these. To adhere to the example's structure, I think the problem should be stated as the original integral equals the first expression. The other equalities are likely derived results or alternative representations, but the core problem is to show the integral equals the first expression. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right).$$\n\nBut the original problem also mentions other forms, so perhaps it's necessary to include them as part of the problem. However, in the example, only the main problem was kept. Considering that, the formatted problem should include the integral equals the first expression, and the other forms are alternative representations, but maybe not part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's equal to any of the given expressions. The user's problem statement has multiple lines connected by equals signs, which is part of the problem. Therefore, the problem should be presented as showing the integral equals the first expression, which is equal to the second, third, and so on. Hence, the problem line would include all those equalities. However, the example didn't do that. To resolve this, perhaps the problem is to show that the integral equals the first expression, and the rest are alternative forms. But since the original problem presents all equalities, maybe the formatted problem should include them. However, in the example, the formatted problem included the main expression. Given the user's example, it's safer to structure the problem as the original first equality, and omit the subsequent ones, as they might be considered part of the solution or alternative representations. Therefore, the assumptions are the integral's limits and integrand, and the problem is to show the integral equals the first expression. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2} - x + 1)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right).$$\n\nAlternatively, since the user's original problem lists multiple equalities, perhaps the problem line should include them connected by equality signs. For example:\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right)=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)+\\frac{4\\pi^{3}}{27\\sqrt{3}}-\\frac{2\\pi}{9\\sqrt{3}}\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)=\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)-2\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right).$$\n\nBut this is quite lengthy. The example didn't include multiple expressions; it included the main one. However, the user's original problem presents them all as part of the problem statement. Therefore, to be faithful, perhaps the problem should include all the equalities. But in the example, the problem was concise. Given that, maybe the problem is to show the integral equals the first expression, and the other forms are part of the solution steps. However, the user explicitly wrote in the original question that the integral equals those expressions. So perhaps the problem is to show the integral equals all those forms. Therefore, the formatted problem should include all the equalities. However, the user's example didn't do that. In the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, without mentioning other representations. So perhaps in this case, the problem should be to show the integral equals the first expression, and the rest are alternative forms. But since the user included multiple equals signs, maybe it's better to include them. Alternatively, the problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's equal to the given expressions. Given that, the formatted problem would include all the equalities. But to prevent the problem line from being too long, perhaps we can present the first two equalities and note the others. However, the example shows that the formatted problem includes the main expression. Given the user's instruction to filter unrelated information, perhaps the integral equals the first expression is the main problem, and the others are part of the solution or alternative representations. The user also mentions Clausen functions and other forms, but those might be part of the solution path. Therefore, the core problem is to show the integral equals the first expression. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2} - x + 1)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right).$$\n\nBut checking the original LaTeX in the user's question, there's a missing backslash in the first expression. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal user's problem:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right)$$\n\nWait, there's a closing brace after \\sqrt{3}, but the \\left( is not closed properly. The user wrote:\n\n...\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(...\\right)\n\nWhich should be \\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(...\\right). Wait, no, there's an extra closing brace. It should be \\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(...\\right), but the original might have a typo. However, when copying, I should replicate it as given. But in the user's input, the LaTeX is:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right)$$\n$$=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)+\\frac{4\\pi^{3}}{27\\sqrt{3}}-\\frac{2\\pi}{9\\sqrt{3}}\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\n$$=\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)-2\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)-\\frac{4\\pi}{9}\\operatorname{Cl}_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$$\n\nSo the first line has a closing } after sqrt{3}, then \\left(...\\right). But the LaTeX might be correct if the user intended \\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}} multiplied by the parenthesis. So in the formatted problem, I need to ensure the LaTeX is correct. However, given that this is the user's original input, perhaps it's better to replicate it as is, assuming any typos are theirs. But in the first expression, after \\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}, there's a } before \\left(, which might be a typo. It should be:\n\n\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}} \\left(...\\right)\n\nBut the user wrote:\n\n\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(...\\right)\n\nWhich is correct. The closing } is for the sqrt{3}, then \\left(... So the LaTeX is correct. Therefore, the formatted problem should include that. Hence, the final answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2} - x + 1)}{x}\\).\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}dx=\\frac{11}{9}\\zeta(3)-\\frac{\\pi}{72\\sqrt{3}}\\left(5\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac13\\right)+4\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac23\\right)-3\\psi_{1}\\left(\\frac56\\right)\\right).$$\n\nBut checking again, the integrand has a closing ) for the log^2. The LaTeX is:\n\n\\frac{\\log^{2}(x^{2}-x+1)}{x}\n\nWhich is correct, since log^2 takes an argument (x² - x + 1). So the formatting is correct.
