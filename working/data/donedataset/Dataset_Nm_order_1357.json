    "AcceptedAnswer": "Part (b) As user644 guessed in his comment, the key argument is a Chebyshev interpolation, and we do not need $|P(x)| \\leq 1$ for every $x\\in [-1,1]$, we only need $|P(x)| \\leq 1$ when $x$ is an extremal Chebyshev point. For an arbitrary polynomial $P=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k$, let us put \n$$\nM(P)=\\sum_{k=0}^n |a_k| \\tag{1}\n$$ Let $T_n$ be the $n$-th Chebyshev polynomial , the unique\npolynomial satisfying $\\cos(n\\theta)=T_n(\\cos(\\theta))$. From the formula\n$\\cos((n+1)\\theta)+\\cos((n-1)\\theta)=2\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(n\\theta)$ one \ndeduces the recurrence relation $$\nT_{n+1}(x)=2xT_n(x)-T_{n-1}(x) \\tag{2}\n$$ It follows then that for any $q$, there are positive \ncoefficients $u_{q,0},u_{q,1}, \\ldots, u_{q,q},\nv_{q,0},\\ldots, v_{q,q}$ such that $$\nT_{2q}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{q}(-1)^{q-k}u_{q,k}x^{2k},\\ \\ \nT_{2q+1}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{q}(-1)^{q-k}v_{q,k}x^{2k+1} \\tag{3}\n$$ Indeed, if (3) is true for some $q$ then on the next level we will have $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nT_{2q+2}(x)&=&(-1)^{q+1}u_{q,0}+\\bigg(\\sum_{k=1}^{q}(-1)^{q+1-k}\n(u_{q,k}+2v_{q,k-1})x^{2k}\\bigg)+2v_{q,q}x^{2q+2}, \\\\\nT_{2q+3}(x)&=&(-1)^{q+1}v_{q,0}x+\\bigg(\\sum_{k=1}^{q}(-1)^{q+1-k}\n(v_{q,k}+2u_{q,k}+4v_{q,k-1})x^{2k}\\bigg)+4v_{q,q}x^{2q+3}\n\\end{array}  \\tag{3'}\n$$ so that (3) follows from an inductive argument, and the base cases\n$T_0=1,T_1=x$ (yielding $u_{0,0}=v_{0,0}=1$). We deduce from (3) that $$\nM(T_{2q})=\\sum_{k=0}^{q} u_{q,k}, \\ \\ \nM(T_{2q+1})=\\sum_{k=0}^{q} v_{q,k},   \\tag{4}\n$$ and combining this with the recurrence relations in (3'), we have $$\nM(T_{2q+2})=M(T_{2q})+2M(T_{2q+1}), \\\nM(T_{2q+3})=2M(T_{2q})+5M(T_{2q+1}) \\tag{5}\n$$ which is equivalent to the simpler, classic recurrence relation $$\nM(T_{n+1})=M(T_n)+2M(T_{n-1}) \\tag{5'}\n$$ Arguing by induction on $n$ from (5') (and the base cases $T_0=1,T_1=x$), \nwe see that $$\nM(T_n)=\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^n+(1-\\sqrt{2})^n}{2} \\tag{6}\n$$ Now let $P=\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kx^k$ be a polynomial such that\n$|P(x)| \\leq 1$ whenever $x$ is a Chebyshev extremal point of degree $n$. Consider the polynomials $$\nB(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\llcorner \\frac{n}{2} \\lrcorner}\na_{2k} t^k, \\ \nC(t)= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\llcorner \\frac{n-1}{2} \\lrcorner}\na_{2k+1} t^k \\tag{7}\n$$ They are linked to $P$ by $$\nP(x)=B(x^2)+xC(x^2), B(x^2)=\\frac{P(x)+P(-x)}{2}, \nC(x^2)=\\frac{P(x)-P(-x)}{2x} \\tag{8}\n$$ Suppose that $n$ is odd, $n=2m+1$. Then the set of Chebyshev extremal points is\n$\\lbrace \\pm x_j\\rbrace_{0\\leq j\\leq m}$ where \n$x_j=\\cos(\\frac{(m-j)\\pi}{n})$. Let us put  $y_j=P(x_j)$ and \n$z_{j}=P(-x_j)$. Then $B$ and $C$ have degree at most $m$, and those polynomials satisfy the interpolation conditions $$\n B(x_j^2)=\\frac{y_j+z_j}{2},\\  C(x_j^2)=\\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j} \\\n(0\\leq j \\leq m)  \\tag{9}\n$$ So by Lagrange interpolation, one can write $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nB(t) &=& \\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{(y_j+z_j)}{2} \\bigg(\\prod_{l\\neq j} \n\\frac{t-x_l^2}{x_j^2-x_l^2}\\bigg) , \\\\\nC(t) &=& \\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j} \\bigg(\\prod_{l\\neq j} \n\\frac{t-x_l^2}{x_j^2-x_l^2}\\bigg)\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{10}\n$$ Let us denote by $s_{d,j}$ the $d$-th elementary symmetric polynomial  in the $m$ variables\n$(x_i^2)_{i\\neq j}$, and by $w_j$ the absolute value of the product \n$\\prod_{l\\neq j}(x_j^2-x_l^2)$. We can then expand (10) as $$\nB(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\bigg(\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j+z_j}{2}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \n\\bigg) t^k, \\ \\\nC(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{m} \\bigg(\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \n\\bigg) t^k \\tag{11}\n$$ So $$\na_{2k}=\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j+z_j}{2}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} , \\ \\\na_{2k+1}=\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j}  \\tag{12}\n$$ Let $\\varepsilon$ and $\\eta$ be two signs in $\\lbrace \\pm 1\\rbrace$.\nWe have $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\varepsilon a_{2k}+\\eta a_{2k+1} &=&\n\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{(\\varepsilon x_j+\\eta)y_j+(\\varepsilon x_j-\\eta)z_j}{2x_j}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \\\\\n& \\leq &\n\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{|\\varepsilon x_j+\\eta|+|\\varepsilon x_j-\\eta|}{2x_j}\n\\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \\\\\n&=&\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{|x_j+\\varepsilon\\eta|+|x_j-\\varepsilon\\eta|}{2x_j}\n\\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \\\\\n&=& \\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{w_jx_j}\n\\end{array} \\tag{13}\n$$ Since (13) above holds for any two signs $\\varepsilon$ and $\\eta$, \nwe see that $$\n|a_{2k}|+|a_{2k+1}| \\leq \\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{w_jx_j} \\tag{14}\n$$ Also, if we take our original $P$ to be $T_n$, then $y_j=(-1)^{m-j}, z_j=-y_j$ so by (12) we have $a_{2k}=0,a_{2k+1}=\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{2x_jw_j}$ and so (14) becomes an equality. Summing up all those inequalities (14) for $k$ between $0$ and $m$ (and remembering they\nall become equalities when $P=T_n$), we see that $M(P) \\leq M(T_n)=\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^n+(1-\\sqrt{2})^n}{2}$ by (6), as wished. Suppose now that $n$ is even, $n=2m$. Then the set of Chebyshev extremal points is\n$\\lbrace 0 ; \\pm x_j\\rbrace_{1\\leq j\\leq m}$ where \n$x_j=\\cos(\\frac{(m-j)\\pi}{n})$. Let us put $b=P(0)$, $y_j=P(x_j)$ and \n$z_{j}=P(-x_j)$. Then $B$ has degree at most $m$, $C$ has degree at most $m-1$ and those polynomials satisfy the interpolation conditions $$\nB(0)=b,\\ B(x_j^2)=\\frac{y_j+z_j}{2},\\  C(x_j^2)=\\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j} \\\n(0\\leq j \\leq m)  \\tag{9'}\n$$ So by Lagrange interpolation, one can write $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nB(t) &=& b(-1)^m\\bigg(\\prod_{l}\\frac{t-x_l^2}{x_l^2}\\bigg)+\\sum_{j=1}^m \\frac{(y_j+z_j)t}{2x_j^2} \\bigg(\\prod_{l\\neq j} \n\\frac{t-x_l^2}{x_j^2-x_l^2}\\bigg) , \\\\\nC(t) &=& \\sum_{j=1}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j} \\bigg(\\prod_{l\\neq j} \n\\frac{t-x_l^2}{x_j^2-x_l^2}\\bigg)\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{10'}\n$$ Let us denote by $s_{d,j}$ the $d$-th elementary symmetric polynomial  in the $m-1$ variables\n$(x_i^2)_{i\\neq j}$, by $S_{d}$ the $d$-th elementary symmetric polynomial of all the $m$ variables\n$(x_i^2)_{1\\leq i \\leq m}$ by $w$ the product $\\prod_{j=1}^m x_j^2$ and by $w_j$ the absolute value of the product \n$\\prod_{l\\neq j}(x_j^2-x_l^2)$. We can then expand (10') as $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\nB(t)&=&b+\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\bigg( \\frac{(-1)^{k+1} b S_{m-k-1}}{w}+\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j+z_j}{2x_j^2}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \n\\bigg) t^{k+1}, \\\\\nC(t)&=&\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \\bigg(\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \n\\bigg) t^k \\tag{11'}\n\\end{array}\n$$ So $$\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\na_{2k+2} &=&\\frac{(-1)^{k+1} b S_{m-k-1}}{w}+\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j+z_j}{2x_j^2}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} , \\\\\na_{2k+1} &=&\\sum_{j=0}^m \\frac{y_j-z_j}{2x_j}\n\\frac{(-1)^{k-j}s_{m-k,j}}{w_j} \\\\\n\\end{array}  \\tag{12'}\n$$ Arguing as in the proof of (14), we see that $$\n|a_{2k+1}|+|a_{2k+2}| \\leq \\frac{S_{m-k-1}}{w}+\\sum_{j=1}^m\\frac{s_{m-k,j}}{w_jx_j^2} (14')\n$$ and that (14') becomes an equality when $P=T_n$. Then, again, we may add all those\ninequalities of the form (14') for $0\\leq k \\leq m-1$ (and add also $|a_0|=|b|$), which finishes\nthe problem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a polynomial f(x) with real coefficients a_i. The conditions given are that for all x where the absolute value of x is less than or equal to 1, the absolute value of f(x) is also less than or equal to 1. Then, there are two parts to prove: the first part is that the sum of the absolute values of the last two coefficients, |a_n| + |a_{n-1}|, is less than or equal to 2^{n-1}. The second part is that the sum of all coefficients' absolute values is less than or equal to [(1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n]/2.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given in the user's instruction shows that each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem:\n\n- The coefficients a_i are real numbers for i from 0 to n. So, the polynomial is f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_n x^n.\n- The condition is that for all x with |x| ≤ 1, |f(x)| ≤ 1.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Let a_i ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n)\", but then the polynomial is sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i. That seems like a typo because the index for a_i starts at i=0, but the problem states i=1,2,…,n. Maybe that's a mistake in the original question. However, since the polynomial includes a_0, the correct assumption should be that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n. So I need to note that.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote \"a_i ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n)\", but the polynomial is from i=0 to n. That's conflicting. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem as given in the user's message:\n\n\"Let a_{i} ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n), and f(x)=∑_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^i such that if |x|⩽1, then |f(x)|⩽1. Prove that: [...]\"\n\nWait, here it says a_i ∈ ℝ for i=1,2,…,n, but the polynomial is from i=0 to n. That suggests that a_0 is also included but not mentioned in the index? That seems like an error. But perhaps in the original problem, the user intended to include a_0. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the indices for a_i should start at i=0. Since the polynomial includes i=0 to n, the correct assumption is that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n. However, the original problem says i=1,2,…,n. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nBut given that the user has written the problem as is, perhaps I should note that. However, maybe it's a mistake in the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a_i for i=0 to n, but wrote i=1 to n. Since the polynomial includes a_0, the assumption should include a_0. So perhaps the correct assumption is a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n, even though the original says i=1,…,n. But since the problem statement is as given, perhaps I should include that as per the problem, but note the discrepancy.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Let a_{i} ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n), and f(x)=∑_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^i...\" So, the coefficients a_i are defined for i=1 to n, but the polynomial starts at i=0. That would mean a_0 is part of the polynomial but not included in the coefficients mentioned. That's contradictory. So this must be a typo. Therefore, the correct assumption is that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to list that each a_i is a real number for i from 0 to n, and that for all x with |x| ≤ 1, |f(x)| ≤ 1.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. Each coefficient a_i is a real number for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n.\n2. For all real numbers x where |x| ≤ 1, the absolute value of f(x) is ≤ 1.\n\nBut the original problem states \"a_i ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n)\", which is inconsistent with the polynomial starting at i=0. Since the user provided this example, perhaps we need to stick to the original wording but note that there might be an error. Alternatively, maybe the original problem indeed includes a_0 in the coefficients, but the index starts at 1, which is a mistake. To resolve this, perhaps the correct assumption is that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n, despite the problem's wording. Because otherwise, the polynomial would have an a_0 term undefined.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a_i is a real number for each i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n.\n- For every x with |x| ≤ 1, |f(x)| ≤ 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove two inequalities:\n\n1. |a_n| + |a_{n-1}| ≤ 2^{n-1}\n2. |a_n| + |a_{n-1}| + ... + |a_1| + |a_0| ≤ [(1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n]/2\n\nSo, the problem statement in the formatted version should include these two parts. But according to the user's example, the problem part should restate the problem as given, so perhaps include both parts.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91\", and the formatted problem included that. So here, the problem part should be the two statements to prove.\n\nBut the user's example shows that even if the original problem has multiple parts, they are included in the problem section. Therefore, the problem section here should include both inequalities to prove.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For each integer i with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number.\n- For all real numbers x, if |x| ≤ 1, then |f(x)| ≤ 1, where f(x) = ∑_{i=0}^n a_i x^i.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that:\n\n1. |a_n| + |a_{n-1}| ≤ 2^{n−1}\n2. |a_n| + |a_{n−1}| + ⋯ + |a_1| + |a_0| ≤ [(1 + √2)^n + (1 − √2)^n]/2\n\nBut wait, the original problem's first part is written as \"|a_{n}|+|a_{n-1} | \\leqslant 2^{n-1}\" and the second part as \"|a_{n}|+|a_{n-1}|+\\cdots+|a_{1}|+|a_{0}|\\leqslant\\dfrac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^n+(1-\\sqrt{2})^n}{2}\".\n\nSo the problem part should include both statements, separated appropriately. Since the user's example combined multiple parts into the problem section, I need to do the same here.\n\nBut the user's example had only one problem statement. However, in this case, there are two separate inequalities to prove. The original problem presents them as two bullet points. So in the formatted problem, I need to present both as the problem to be solved.\n\nHowever, the problem section in the format is a single field. So perhaps include both parts in the problem statement, separated as given.\n\nIn the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nProve that: $|a_{n}|+|a_{n-1} | \\leqslant 2^{n-1}$. $|a_{n}|+|a_{n-1}|+\\cdots+|a_{1}|+|a_{0}|\\leqslant\\dfrac{(1+\\sqrt{2})^n+(1-\\sqrt{2})^n}{2}$.\n\nBut in LaTeX, it's better to present them as two separate items. However, the problem statement in the formatted version should capture exactly what's to be proven. So perhaps list them both in the problem section.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\nEach coefficient a_i is a real number for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nFor all real numbers x with |x| ≤ 1, |f(x)| ≤ 1, where f(x) = ∑_{i=0}^n a_i x^i.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that:\n\n1. |a_n| + |a_{n-1}| ≤ 2^{n−1}\n\n2. |a_n| + |a_{n−1}| + ⋯ + |a_1| + |a_0| ≤ [(1 + √2)^n + (1 − √2)^n]/2\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed line by line, each as a separate bullet point. So in the formatted problem, each assumption is a separate line.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were:\n\n- n is an integer,\n\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nSimilarly, here, the assumptions are:\n\n- a_i ∈ ℝ for each i = 0, 1, ..., n.\n\n- For all x with |x| ≤ 1, |f(x)| ≤ 1.\n\nBut wait, the original problem statement says \"Let a_{i} ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n), and f(x)=∑_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^i such that if |x|⩽1, then |f(x)|⩽1.\"\n\nBut as discussed, there's a discrepancy because the indices for a_i are given as 1 to n, but the polynomial starts at i=0. Therefore, perhaps the original problem has a typo, and the coefficients are from i=0 to n. Therefore, in the assumptions, we need to correct that.\n\nBut since the user's original problem states \"a_i ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n)\", but then defines the polynomial from i=0 to n, there is an inconsistency. However, to structure the problem correctly, we need to resolve this. Since the polynomial includes a_0, the assumption must include a_0. Therefore, the correct assumption is that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0,1,…,n, even if the original problem mistakenly says i=1,…,n. Otherwise, the polynomial would have an undefined a_0 term.\n\nTherefore, in the assumptions, we list:\n\n- For each integer i with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, a_i is a real number.\n\n- For all real numbers x, if |x| ≤ 1, then the absolute value of f(x) = ∑_{i=0}^n a_i x^i is ≤ 1.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have these two assumptions, and the problem part includes the two inequalities to prove.\n\nI need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n), and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" However, the formatted assumption included n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is wrong. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then there should be no additional assumption that n is divisible by 7. Therefore, maybe the user made an error in their example. But regardless, the instruction says to follow the format, which in the example includes filtering unrelated information. So perhaps in that example, the user incorrectly added an assumption. But I need to proceed according to the user's instructions, which say to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with its actual assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original problem says \"Let a_i ∈ ℝ (i=1,2,…,n)\", but defines the polynomial up to i=0. Therefore, the correct assumption is that a_i ∈ ℝ for i=0 to n. The original problem's statement is likely a typo, and the correct indices should start at 0. So, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- Each coefficient a_i is a real number for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n.\n\n- For all real numbers x with |x| ≤ 1, the absolute value of f(x) = ∑_{i=0}^n a_i x^i is ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that:\n\n1. |a_n| + |a_{n-1}| ≤ 2^{n−1}\n\n2. |a_n| + |a_{n−1}| + ⋯ + |a_0| ≤ [(1 + √2)^n + (1 − √2)^n]/2\n\nThus, the assumptions are correctly capturing the conditions given, and the problem part includes both inequalities to prove.",
