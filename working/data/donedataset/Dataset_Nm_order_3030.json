    "Content": "Prove there's a simple path of length $k$ in a simple graph $G$ where all the vertices have degree of at least $k$. Relevant definitions: $G$ is a simple graph that consists of a vertex set $V(G) = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}$ and an edge set $E(G) = \\{e_1, e_2, ..., e_m\\}$ where each edge is an ordered pair of vertices. The edge $\\{u,v\\}$ is denoted $uv$.  A walk of length $k$ is a sequence $v_0,e_1,v_1,e_2,...,e_k,v_k$ of vertices and edges such that $e_i=v_{i-1}v_i$ for all $i$. A path is a walk with no repeated vertex. My attempt: Induction, for $k=1$ it's obvious. Suppose for $k-1$ and we'll prove for $k$. Let $G$ be a simple graph such that $\\forall v \\in V : d(v)\\ge k$. We can assume that there are at least $k+1$ vertices since there are $k$ neighbours to every vertex. Let $v_0$ be some vertex, it has $k$ neighbours, we'll move to one of its neighbours say $v_1$ and remove $v_0$. So now there are $k$ vertices with a degree of at least $k-1$ and from the induction hypothesis we'll have a path of length $k$. Is using only $k$ vertices from $n$ right? Does it keep the generality when using only all the neighbours of $v_0$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The problem with that approach is that the path of length $k-1$ in $G-v_0$ may not have a vertex adjacent to $v_0$ at either end, so you may not be able to extend it to a path of length $k$ in $G$. You don’t actually need induction on $k$. Start at any vertex $v_0$. It has degree $k$, so it’s adjacent to some vertex $v_1$. Assuming that $k>1$, $v_1$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $v_2$ other than $v_0$. If $k>2$, then $v_2$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $v_3$ different from $v_0$ and $v_1$. And so on. In general you can continue this argument until you’ve chosen $v_k$ adjacent to $v_{k-1}$ and different from $v_0,\\ldots,v_{k-2}$, at which point you have a path of length $k$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that in a simple graph G where every vertex has a degree of at least k, there's a simple path of length k. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that G is a simple graph, all vertices have degree at least k. Wait, the original problem mentions \"all the vertices have degree of at least k\". So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a simple graph.\n2. Every vertex in G has a degree of at least k.\n\nBut wait, the problem might have other implicit assumptions. For example, the graph must have at least k+1 vertices? Because if you have a vertex with degree k, it must have k neighbors, so the graph needs at least k+1 vertices. But does the problem explicitly state that? The user's attempt mentions assuming at least k+1 vertices. However, the problem statement itself doesn't specify this. So should that be an assumption? Or is it a conclusion from the given degrees?\n\nWait, the problem as stated says \"all vertices have degree of at least k\". If every vertex has degree at least k, then the graph must have at least k+1 vertices, because a vertex can't have more neighbors than there are other vertices. So if a graph has a vertex of degree k, the minimum number of vertices is k+1. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that the graph is such that this holds. But since the problem doesn't state it explicitly, maybe it's not an assumption we need to list. Instead, it's part of the proof to note that the graph must have at least k+1 vertices.\n\nThe user's attempt mentions assuming at least k+1 vertices, but the problem doesn't state that. So in the assumptions, according to the format, we should list only what's given in the problem. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a simple graph.\n2. Every vertex in G has a degree of at least k.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all the vertices have degree of at least k\", so that's two assumptions? Or is \"G is a simple graph\" one assumption, and \"each vertex in G has degree at least k\" another. Since the format says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So here, \"G is a simple graph\" is one assumption. Then \"For all vertices v in G, the degree of v is at least k\" is another. So those are two separate assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that there's a simple path of length k. The problem statement is straightforward. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So each line is a separate condition. So here, \"G is a simple graph\" and \"All vertices in G have degree at least k\" are two separate assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a simple graph,\nEvery vertex v in G has degree at least k.\n\nProblem:\nProve there's a simple path of length k in G.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Prove there's a simple path of length k in a simple graph G where all the vertices have degree of at least k\". So the problem is as stated. But according to the format, the assumptions are listed, then the problem is restated. So perhaps in the problem line, it's just the statement without repeating the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was restated in the problem section, with the assumptions filtered. So in the example, the original problem had an expression A(n) and wanted to prove it's divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the user had \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That might have been a mistake in the example. But regardless, we need to follow the instruction.\n\nThe task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumption and Problem sections. So in the current problem, the user's question is to prove that in a simple graph G where every vertex has degree at least k, there exists a simple path of length k.\n\nThe problem statement includes that G is simple and all vertices have degree at least k. The user also provided some definitions and their attempt, but those are to be filtered out. The relevant definitions are part of the problem's context but might not be part of the assumptions. The problem's own statement already includes that G is a simple graph and all vertices have degree at least k. So the assumptions are exactly those two points. The problem is to prove the existence of a simple path of length k.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a simple graph,\nEvery vertex in G has degree at least k.\n\nProblem:\nProve there's a simple path of length k in G.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was restated, but with some conditions moved to assumptions. So perhaps the problem line here should be \"Prove there's a simple path of length k in G\", and the assumptions are that G is a simple graph and each vertex has degree at least k.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The problem's original title and question already state that G is a simple graph with all vertices having degree at least k, so those are the assumptions. The problem is to show the existence of a simple path of length k. So the formatted version is as above.",
