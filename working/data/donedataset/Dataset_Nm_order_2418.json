    "Content": "I was reading Stewart's Theorem which states that Given a triangle with side lengths $a$ , $b$ , $c$ and a cevian of length $d$ which divides $a$ into two segments $m$ and $n$ as shown in the figure we must have $$b^2m+c^2n=a(d^2+mn)$$ which is often remembered using the funny mnemonic, \"A man and his dad put a bomb in the sink\" which gives $$man+dad=bmb+cnc$$ Now, this can be proved quite easily using The Law of Cosines on $\\theta$ and $\\theta^\\prime$ as marked in the figure. You can find the proof here . But, I was thinking if there is a more elementary geometric argument (without using trignometry and without using a lot of algebraic manipulation) to see this clearly in front of our eyes. I tried giving an attempt, but it seems extremely difficult using only elementary geometry since there is no trivial symmetry immediately observable in this diagram. Also, the terms involved in the formula, i.e., $b^2m$ , $c^2n$ , $ad^2$ and $amn$ , are all of dimension $[L^3]$ - so, it seems difficult to even draw areas on sides and geometrically manipulate them. Any elegant geometric insight or an intuitive idea would be appreciated. Note: as pointed out in the comments, and as you can see here as well, the Cosine Law can be very well proved using elementary geometry. While that is of course an answer, we all agree that it's cheating at some level. There's another answer as well, but this one's so much algebraic jargon, I would prefer trigonometry instead. Also, Stewart's book, Some general theorems of considerable use in the higher parts of mathematics seems to contain a completely geometric argument. But the absense of diagrams in Google Scans combined with the length of this solution makes it very difficult to follow. I would also love to see a summarized version of this in more understandable way without loosing the geometric essence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $m:=a\\mu$ and $n:=a\\nu$ . The highlighted similar triangles $\\triangle A'DB$ , $\\triangle B''B'B$ , $\\triangle C''C'A$ in the figure (whose construction is detailed below) have corresponding sides in proportion, say, $\\lambda:\\mu$ ; we deduce $\\triangle ABC\\sim\\triangle B''BA'$ , so that $|A'B''|=b\\lambda=|AC''|$ , and we can write $|AA'|=|AC''|+|AB''|$ . Now, we simply apply the Intersecting Chords/Secants theorems thusly $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\color{green}{a\\mu\\cdot a\\nu} = \\overbrace{\\color{green}{|AD|\\,|A'D|}}^{\\bigcirc ABC} &= |AD|\\,(\\,|AA'|-|AD|\\,) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= |AD|\\,(\\,\\color{blue}{|AC''|}+\\color{red}{|AB''|}-|AD|\\,) \\\\[0.5em]\n&=\\overbrace{\\color{blue}{|AC|\\,|AC'|}}^{\\bigcirc CC'C''}+\\overbrace{\\color{red}{|AB|\\,|AB'|}}^{\\bigcirc BB'B''} - |AD|^2 \\\\[0.5em]\n&=\\color{blue}{b\\cdot b\\mu}+\\color{red}{c\\cdot c\\nu} - d^2 \\tag{$\\star$}\n\\end{align}$$ giving the equivalent of Stewart's Theorem. $\\square$ The diagram is created by extending cevian $\\overline{AD}$ to meet the circumcircle at $A'$ . Then $B'$ and $C'$ divide $\\overline{BA}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ in the ratio $\\mu:\\nu$ , and circumcircles $\\bigcirc DBB'$ and $\\bigcirc DCC'$ meet the cevian in points $B''$ and $C''$ . A little angle-chasing establishes the similarity of the highlighted triangles. Admittedly, that's quite a bit of setup —and perhaps there's an easier path to the key relation $|AA'|=|AB''|+|AC''|$ — but I rather like how $(\\star)$ falls right out.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem about Stewart's Theorem. The user wants the assumptions and the problem structured according to the given format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question.\n\nThe original question mentions a triangle with side lengths a, b, c. There's a cevian of length d that divides side a into segments m and n. The theorem's equation is given as b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn). The user is asking for an elementary geometric proof without trigonometry or heavy algebra.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are about the triangle and the cevian. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me list them out:\n\n1. There's a triangle with side lengths a, b, c. Each side is a different object, but since they are sides of the same triangle, maybe list them as sides of the triangle.\n2. There's a cevian in the triangle. The cevian has length d.\n3. This cevian divides side a into two segments m and n. So, side a is split into m and n by the cevian.\n\nWait, the problem states \"a cevian of length d which divides a into two segments m and n.\" So the key elements are the triangle with sides a, b, c; the cevian with length d; and the segments m and n on side a. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The triangle has sides of lengths a, b, and c.\n- A cevian of length d is drawn in the triangle.\n- The cevian divides the side of length a into two segments of lengths m and n.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn).\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line and addresses one property. The original problem didn't specify any particular conditions like the triangle being right-angled or anything else, so the assumptions are just the existence of the triangle, the cevian, and the division of side a into m and n. The problem is to prove Stewart's Theorem as given.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden assumption, but the problem as stated doesn't mention any. The user is focused on the proof method, not on additional conditions. So the formatted answer should list those three assumptions and then the problem.",
