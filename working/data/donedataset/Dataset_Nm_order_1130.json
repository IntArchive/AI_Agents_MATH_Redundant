    "Content": "Our lecturer defined the following: Let $K=\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt d)$ be a quadratic field and $p$ a prime number, then (1) $\\ p$ is ramified in $K$ if $\\mathcal O_K⁄(p)\\cong \\mathbb F_p [x]⁄(x^2)$ (2) $\\ p$ is split in $K\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  $ if $\\mathcal O_K⁄(p)\\cong \\mathbb F_p[x]^2$ (3) $\\ p$ is inert in $K\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ $ if $\\mathcal O_K⁄(p)\\cong \\mathbb F_{p^2}$ And he stated: Let $K$ and $p$ be as above. Then: $p$ is ramified $\\iff p$ divides the discriminant disc$(K)$ of $K$ $p$ split $\\iff p\\nmid \\text{disc(K)}$ and d is a QR mod p $p$ is inert $\\iff p\\nmid \\text{disc(K)}$ and d is not a QR mod p To be honest, I have a little bit of trouble wrapping my head around these definitions. Also, I don't seem to be able to find any useful sources online, which provide examples or (not to mention) use similar definitions. All I can find are things like \"totally split\", \"remains prime in\", etc. and a lot of different notation. Hence my question, are these definitions actually common and is there any way of explaining them in a more approachable manner? edit: Just in case somebody is interested, the following texts, which I found after further research, appeared quite useful to me: An Introduction to Number Theory, by G. Everest: http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1852339179 Specifically Chapter 4.4 The Ideal Class Group and Section 4.4.1 Prime Ideals The lecture notes of Robin Chapman: http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/rjchapma/notes/ant.pdf (p. 16-18) http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/rjchapma/notes/ant2.pdf (p. 38-39 & Chapter 5)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First let me say your lecturer is only right assuming that $p$ is an odd prime number . IMHO this business of bringing in the discriminant is really confusing, at least for a quadratic field. Let me now give you the usual definition (as found in Neukirch, Marcus) of these terms and then proceed to show you how they are equivalent to your definition above. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field. Choose a prime $p \\in \\Bbb{Z}$, we know that $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a Dedekind domain and hence $(p)$ factors into primes $\\mathfrak{p}_1^{e_1}\\ldots \\mathfrak{p}_n^{e_n}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. We say that $p$ is ramified in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ if there is at least one $j$ for which $e_j > 1$. We say $p$ is totally split if the $e_i = 1$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $n = [K : \\Bbb{Q}]$ We say $p$ is inert if it does not split at all in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Thus in the case that $K$ is a quadratic field, we see a prime $p$ is ramified if $(p)$ factors into $\\mathfrak{p}^2$, totally split if it factors as $\\mathfrak{p}_1\\mathfrak{p}_2$ and inert if it just remains the same. Now how does this business about the discriminant come in? The discriminant of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ when $K = \\Bbb{Q}(\\sqrt{n})$ is $n$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$, otherwise it is $4n$. Now the main reason why I say bringing in the discriminant is misleading is because the key point that $p|n \\implies$ $$(p) = (p, \\sqrt{n})^2$$ in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ gets piled under a heap of abstraction ! How do you see the equality above? Well expand the product of the two ideals, see what you get! What about the case when $p \\nmid n$? Check for yourself that $p$ splits as $$(p) = (p, m + \\sqrt{n})(p,m - \\sqrt{n})$$ where $n \\equiv m^2 \\mod p$. What about the last case when $p \\nmid n$ and $n$ is not a quadratic residue mod $p$? To see that $p$ is inert I suggest that you compute the quotient $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p)$ explicitly and see that it is a field (thus integral domain).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is talking about definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field. The lecturer gave specific definitions using quotient rings of the ring of integers modulo p. The user is confused because these definitions seem different from what they found online, which uses terms like \"totally split\" or \"remains prime\". They want to know if these definitions are common and if there's a more approachable explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the key parts of the problem. The original question includes definitions provided by the lecturer for ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field K = Q(√d). Each case is defined by the structure of the quotient ring O_K/(p). The lecturer also provided equivalent conditions involving the discriminant and whether d is a quadratic residue modulo p.\n\nThe user's main problem is understanding these definitions and their relation to more commonly seen terms. They also mention difficulty finding sources with similar definitions or examples.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format. The assumptions should list each condition given by the lecturer for each case (ramified, split, inert). Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. The problem is the user's question about the commonality of these definitions and seeking a more approachable explanation.\n\nWait, but the example given in the original task is about a problem to prove something, but here the user is asking for clarification and explanation of definitions. How to fit that into the Problem part?\n\nLooking back at the example: The original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the user is asking if the definitions are common and for an explanation. So maybe the problem is to verify the equivalence between the algebraic definitions (using quotient rings) and the arithmetic conditions (discriminant and QR mod p). Alternatively, the problem could be phrased as understanding whether these definitions are standard and how to reconcile them with other sources.\n\nBut according to the user's question, the main problem is: \"are these definitions actually common and is there any way of explaining them in a more approachable manner?\"\n\nSo the problem part should capture that. The assumptions would be the definitions given by the lecturer for ramified, split, inert primes, and the equivalent conditions involving discriminant and quadratic residues.\n\nBut the user is not stating a problem to solve, but asking for explanation. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, which was in the context of a problem to prove. Maybe in this case, since the question is about definitions and their commonality, the problem part would be the user's question, and the assumptions are the definitions provided by the lecturer.\n\nBut the original example's assumptions included the conditions given in the problem. Here, the user's question is about the definitions, so the assumptions would be the definitions given by the lecturer, and the problem is to understand if they're common and get a better explanation.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumptions would list each definition (1), (2), (3) as separate points. Also, the equivalent conditions stated by the lecturer (the iff statements) could be considered as part of the problem? Or are they part of the assumptions?\n\nWait, the lecturer defined ramified, split, inert in terms of the quotient rings, and then stated equivalences in terms of the discriminant and quadratic residues. The user is confused about the definitions and their relation to other sources.\n\nBut in the original example, the assumptions were the conditions given (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the problem is the user's question: Are these definitions common and can they be explained more approachably? But the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to verify the equivalences stated by the lecturer (p is ramified iff p divides discriminant, etc.), but the user's main question is about the definitions' commonality and explanation.\n\nHmm, the user is not explicitly asking to prove the equivalences, but is confused about the definitions and their relation to other sources. The problem, as per the user's words, is: \"are these definitions actually common and is there any way of explaining them in a more approachable manner?\"\n\nBut the given format is for a problem to solve, like \"Prove that...\". However, the user's problem is a question about understanding definitions. Maybe the problem statement here is to reconcile the given definitions with the standard terminology and provide an approachable explanation.\n\nBut given the example, maybe we need to structure the problem as per the lecturer's statements. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove something, with assumptions on n. Here, perhaps the problem is to verify the lecturer's equivalences (the iff statements) using the given definitions. But the user's actual problem is understanding the definitions, not proving the equivalences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to understand the definitions in terms of the quotient rings and their relation to splitting of primes. The user is confused by the definitions and wants an explanation.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-examine the original problem.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n\"Hence my question, are these definitions actually common and is there any way of explaining them in a more approachable manner?\"\n\nSo the problem is two-fold: whether the definitions are common, and how to explain them more approachably. But how to phrase this as a problem in the required format.\n\nGiven that the example's problem was a statement to prove, perhaps here the problem would be phrased as: \"Are the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field common, and how can they be explained in a more approachable way?\"\n\nBut the user's original question is more about understanding the definitions, reconciling them with other sources, and seeking examples. The problem is not a mathematical statement to prove but a conceptual question.\n\nHowever, the example given in the task shows that the problem part is a mathematical statement to prove. This suggests that perhaps the assistant is supposed to structure the problem as a mathematical problem, even if the original question is conceptual. Maybe the key is to extract the mathematical problem embedded in the user's confusion.\n\nLooking at the user's problem, they were given definitions and equivalent conditions. The problem could be to show the equivalence between the algebraic definitions (quotient rings) and the arithmetic conditions (discriminant and QR). But the user's question is more about the definitions themselves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the lecturer's stated equivalences (the iff statements) given the definitions. However, the user is not asking for the proof but understanding the definitions.\n\nBut given the example, where the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under certain assumptions, perhaps here the problem is to prove the lecturer's statements (the iff conditions) given the definitions. But the user's actual question is about the definitions' commonality and explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to \"Explain the definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field in terms of the structure of the quotient ring O_K/(p) and their relation to the discriminant and quadratic residues modulo p.\"\n\nBut I need to follow the user's original question as per the example. Let me check the original example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n is divisible by 7) and the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem, not the definitions. Here, the user's problem includes definitions provided by the lecturer. So perhaps the assumptions are the definitions given for ramified, split, inert primes (the quotient ring structures) and the problem is the equivalence statements (the iff conditions involving discriminant and QR). But the user's question is not to prove these equivalences but to understand the definitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the definitions, and the problem is the user's question: are these definitions common and can they be explained more approachably?\n\nBut the example had mathematical assumptions leading to a mathematical problem. Here, the user's problem is a conceptual question. However, perhaps we need to structure it as per the problem's components.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic field.\n- Let $p$ be a prime number.\n- $p$ is ramified in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2)$.\n- $p$ is split in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p[x]^2$.\n- $p$ is inert in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$.\n- $p$ is ramified if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant of $K$.\n- $p$ is split if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n- $p$ is inert if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n\nProblem: Are these definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field common, and how can they be explained in a more approachable manner?\n\nBut the example had each assumption as a single line addressing one property. Here, the definitions of ramified, split, inert each take one line. Then the equivalent conditions (iff statements) are additional assumptions. However, the user is confused about the definitions and their relation to other sources.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to reconcile the given definitions (using quotient rings) with the standard terminology (ramified, split, inert) and the equivalent conditions involving discriminant and quadratic residues.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to verify the equivalences stated by the lecturer. But the user's question is not to prove them but to understand the definitions.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The original example had assumptions that were conditions on n, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the problem is more about understanding definitions. Given the format, perhaps the problem part is the user's question: Are these definitions common and can they be explained more approachably? And the assumptions are the definitions given by the lecturer.\n\nBut according to the user's original problem, the lecturer provided both the definitions in terms of quotient rings and the equivalent conditions. So the assumptions would include both the definitions and the equivalences.\n\nBut perhaps in the formatted problem, we list the definitions as assumptions and the problem is the user's question.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were the given conditions in the problem statement. Here, the problem is the user's question, which is conceptual. However, the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\", which in the example was a mathematical statement to prove. So maybe the problem here is to prove the equivalence between the quotient ring definitions and the discriminant/QR conditions. But the user didn't state that explicitly; they are asking about the definitions' commonality and explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to \"Explain the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field and their equivalence to the conditions involving the discriminant and quadratic residues modulo p.\"\n\nBut the user's main problem is understanding the definitions and their commonality. So maybe the problem is to verify if the given definitions are equivalent to standard definitions and provide an approachable explanation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The user wants to know if these definitions are common and to get a better explanation. The formatted problem needs to capture that. But the example shows a problem to prove. This is a bit conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to \"Relate the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field to the discriminant and quadratic residue conditions, and explain their commonality.\"\n\nBut given the original question, perhaps the best way is to list the definitions as assumptions and then state the problem as the user's question.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n$K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is a quadratic field,\n$p$ is a prime number,\n$p$ is ramified in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2)$,\n$p$ is split in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p$,\n$p$ is inert in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$,\n$p$ is ramified in $K$ if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant of $K$,\n$p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$,\n$p$ is inert in $K$ if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n\nProblem: Are the provided definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field commonly used, and can they be explained in a more approachable manner?\n\nWait, but the problem in the example was a statement to prove. Here, the user's problem is a yes/no question and a request for explanation. However, maybe the problem part should be phrased as \"Determine whether the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes are commonly used and provide an approachable explanation of them.\"\n\nBut I think the format requires the problem to be a mathematical problem, possibly a proof or a calculation. The user's question is more of a conceptual question, which might not fit the format perfectly. However, following the example, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalences stated by the lecturer, but the user didn't ask for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is the user's main confusion: reconciling the given definitions with standard terminology. The problem could be phrased as: \"Reconcile the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field with standard terminology in algebraic number theory.\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a direct mathematical statement. Given that, perhaps the assistant needs to extract the core mathematical problem embedded in the user's question.\n\nLooking back, the user was given definitions (1), (2), (3) and the lecturer stated equivalences. The user is confused because other sources use different terms. The problem could be to prove the equivalences given the definitions. For example, prove that p is ramified iff p divides the discriminant, using the given definition of ramified as the quotient ring structure.\n\nBut the user's question is not to prove the equivalence but to understand the definitions. However, maybe the problem is phrased as such to fit the example's format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to \"Prove the equivalence between the given definitions of ramified, split, and inert primes in a quadratic field and the conditions involving the discriminant and quadratic residues modulo p.\"\n\nIn that case, the assumptions would be the definitions, and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nBut the user's actual question is not to prove this equivalence but to understand if these definitions are common and to get an explanation. However, structuring it as per the example, perhaps the problem part is the equivalence statements, and the assumptions are the definitions.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions were the conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions were the hypotheses, and the problem was the conclusion.\n\nHere, if the problem is to prove the equivalences (p ramified iff divides discriminant, etc.), then the assumptions would be the definitions of ramified, split, inert via quotient rings. The problem part would be to prove the equivalent conditions.\n\nBut the user didn't explicitly ask to prove that; they asked if these definitions are common and for an explanation.\n\nBut given the example, maybe this is the way to go. The user is implicitly asking to understand why the equivalences hold (which connects the definitions to discriminant and QR), which is a mathematical problem. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic field,\n$p$ is a prime number,\n$p$ is ramified in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2)$,\n$p$ is split in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p$,\n$p$ is inert in $K$ if $\\mathcal{O}_K/(p) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n- $p$ is ramified in $K$ if and only if $p$ divides the discriminant of $K$,\n- $p$ splits in $K$ if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$,\n- $p$ is inert in $K$ if and only if $p$ does not divide the discriminant of $K$ and $d$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$.\n\nThis would fit the example's structure: assumptions are the definitions, problem is to prove the equivalences. However, the user's original question is more about the definitions' commonality and explanation, but perhaps this is the closest fit to the required format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as the user wrote: \"are these definitions actually common and is there any way of explaining them in a more approachable manner?\" But the format might require a mathematical problem. Since the example had a problem to prove, perhaps this is the intended approach.\n\nIn conclusion, given the example's structure, the problem is likely to prove the equivalences between the quotient ring definitions and the discriminant/QR conditions. The assumptions are the definitions of ramified, split, inert via quotient rings and the quadratic field setup.",
