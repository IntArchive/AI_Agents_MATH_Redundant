    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let \n$$G(x)=\\frac{f(x)}{e^x}.$$\nDifferentiate, and use $f'(x)=f(x)$ to conclude $G'(x)$ is identically $0$. Then either quote the theorem that says that a function whose derivative is identically $0$ is constant. Or else alternately prove that theorem, by using the Mean Value Theorem. Note that more or less the same proof shows that if $f'(x)=kf(x)$, where $k$ is a constant, then $f(x)=Ce^{kx}$ for some constant $C$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read the original question from Math Stack Exchange and identify the key elements. The title is \"Showing f'(x) = f(x) implies an exponential function\". The user mentions it's a possible duplicate of another question about proving that exp(x) is the only function where f(x) = f'(x). The problem statement is to show that if f'(x) = f(x), then f must be of the form a·exp(x) without using integrals. The user tried using Taylor series but had trouble with the error term convergence.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem here is about a function f with derivative equal to itself. So the main assumption is that f is a function from R to R such that f'(x) = f(x) for all x. Also, the problem specifies not to use integrals, so that's another condition. The user didn't mention any specific restrictions on f other than differentiability, but since we're dealing with differential equations, we might assume f is differentiable everywhere. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that f is differentiable, but since f'(x) = f(x), that implies f is differentiable. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. f: R → R (the function's domain and codomain)\n2. For all x in R, f'(x) = f(x) (the derivative condition)\n3. The proof must not use integrals (a constraint on the method)\n\nWait, but the original problem doesn't mention anything about the function being defined on all real numbers, but the user's problem statement says \"f: R → R\". So that's part of the problem's assumption. Also, the problem requires showing that f must be of the form a·exp(x). So putting this together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function f is defined from R to R.\n- For every real number x, the derivative f'(x) exists and equals f(x).\n- The proof must not involve integrals.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) = a·exp(x) for some constant a.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"implies the function is defined as f: R → R : x → a·exp(x)\". So maybe the problem statement is to prove that such a function must be of that form. But the user's example had assumptions listed line by line. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f: R → R (the domain and codomain)\n2. For all x ∈ R, f'(x) = f(x)\n3. The proof does not use integrals\n\nBut the problem is to show that f must be a·exp(x). So I need to structure the assumptions as separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The third condition is a constraint on the method, not on the function itself, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which is a condition on the object (n). The method constraints like not using integrals might be part of the problem statement. But the user's example didn't include method constraints in the assumptions. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So those are conditions on n. The method wasn't mentioned in assumptions, but maybe the problem statement includes the method constraints. In the current problem, the user says \"without using integrals\" which is a constraint on the method. So perhaps the assumptions should only include conditions on the function, and the problem statement includes the method constraint.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So \"without using integrals\" is a condition on the proof method, not on the function. Therefore, maybe it's part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. For example, in the example given, the problem statement was \"Prove that ... is divisible by 91.\" The assumptions were about n. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R.\n2. For every x in R, f'(x) = f(x).\n\nAnd the problem statement is to show that f(x) = a·exp(x), without using integrals.\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Showing f'(x) = f(x) implies an exponential function\". So the key assumptions are the differentiability and the equality of the derivative to the function. The problem is to show that under these conditions, f must be an exponential function. The method constraint is \"without using integrals\" which is part of the problem instruction. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f: R → R is a function.\n- For all x ∈ R, f'(x) = f(x).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a constant a such that f(x) = a·exp(x) for all x ∈ R, without using integrals.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be phrased as the user's original problem: \"Show that the statement f'(x) = f(x) implies the function is defined as f: R → R : x → a·exp(x) without using integrals.\"\n\nBut the key is to separate the assumptions (properties of the function) from the problem's instruction (to prove something under those assumptions with a method constraint). So the \"without using integrals\" is part of the problem instruction, not an assumption on the function. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions about the function and its derivative, and the problem statement includes the method constraint.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$f$ is a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nFor every real number $x$, the derivative $f'(x)$ exists and equals $f(x)$.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a constant $a$ such that $f(x) = a \\cdot \\exp(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ without using integrals.\n###",
