    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the Taylor series expansion of the function g_α(x) = (1+x)^α converges to the function itself for |x| < 1 by proving that the remainder term R_n(x) approaches zero as n approaches infinity. The original question mentions both the integral form and the Lagrange form of the remainder. The user has made progress for x > 0 but is stuck on x < 0. They want an elementary method, not using Stirling's approximation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Taylor's theorem with remainder. For a function that's smooth enough, the Taylor series converges to the function if the remainder term goes to zero. Here, the function is (1+x)^α, which is analytic for |x| < 1, but maybe they need to show it using the remainder term directly.\n\nThe Lagrange form of the remainder is R_n(x) = x^{n+1} * binomial(α, n+1) * (1 + ξ)^{α - n -1}, where ξ is between 0 and x. For convergence, we need |R_n(x)| → 0 as n → ∞.\n\nFor x in (-1, 1), let's consider two cases: x positive and x negative. The user handled x positive by rewriting the remainder in terms of q = x/(1+x), which is less than 1, and using the convergence of the binomial series. But for x negative, this approach might not work because the term (1 + ξ) could be less than 1 if ξ is negative, which complicates things.\n\nLet me think about x negative. Suppose x is in (-1, 0). Then ξ is in (x, 0), which is between -1 and 0. So 1 + ξ is in (0, 1). Then (1 + ξ)^{α - n -1} could be problematic because as n increases, the exponent α - n -1 becomes very negative if α isn't an integer. So (1 + ξ)^{α - n -1} = 1/(1 + ξ)^{n +1 - α}. Since 1 + ξ is less than 1 (because ξ is negative), this term would grow exponentially if 1/(1 + ξ) > 1. But we have x^{n+1} which is negative but its absolute value is |x|^{n+1}. So maybe we need to balance the decay of |x|^{n+1} against the growth of (1 + ξ)^{-(n+1 - α)}.\n\nWait, let's write |R_n(x)| = |binomial(α, n+1)| * |x|^{n+1} * |1 + ξ|^{α - n -1}.\n\nSince x is negative, |x| is between 0 and 1. Also, ξ is between x and 0, so 1 + ξ is between 1 + x and 1. Since x is in (-1, 0), 1 + x is between 0 and 1. Therefore, 1 + ξ is between 1 + x and 1. Let's denote 1 + ξ = t, where t is in (1 + x, 1). Since x is negative, 1 + x is less than 1. But when ξ is close to x, t could be close to 1 + x, which is greater than 0. However, 1 + x > 0 because x > -1.\n\nSo t is in (0,1) only if 1 + x > 0. Wait, since x > -1, 1 + x > 0. So t is in (1 + x, 1), which is a subset of (0,1). Therefore, |1 + ξ| = t is between 0 and 1. Then |1 + ξ|^{α - n -1} = t^{α - n -1} = t^{- (n +1 - α)} = (1/t)^{n +1 - α)}.\n\nSince t is between 0 and 1, 1/t is greater than 1. So (1/t)^{n +1} grows exponentially. But we have |x|^{n+1} which decays exponentially. The question is, which one dominates? The product |x|^{n+1} * (1/t)^{n+1 - α}.\n\nBut t is at least 1 + x (since ξ ≥ x), so 1/t ≤ 1/(1 + x). Thus, (1/t)^{n+1 - α} ≤ (1/(1 + x))^{n+1 - α}.\n\nTherefore, |R_n(x)| ≤ |binomial(α, n+1)| * |x|^{n+1} * (1/(1 + x))^{n+1 - α}.\n\nLet me factor out the terms involving n:\n\n(|x| / (1 + x))^{n+1} * (1/(1 + x))^{-α} * |binomial(α, n+1)|.\n\nNote that (1/(1 + x))^{-α} is (1 + x)^α, which is a constant with respect to n. So the key term is (|x| / (1 + x))^{n+1} multiplied by |binomial(α, n+1)|.\n\nNow, |x| = -x because x is negative. So |x| / (1 + x) = (-x)/(1 + x). Let's denote y = -x, so y is in (0,1). Then |x|/(1 + x) = y / (1 - y). Since y < 1, 1 - y > 0, and y / (1 - y) is a positive number less than infinity. But for convergence, we need (y / (1 - y))^{n} * |binomial(α, n)| to go to zero as n increases.\n\nWait, but the binomial coefficient |binomial(α, n+1)| behaves asymptotically like C * n^{α -1} for some constant C, by the properties of binomial coefficients with real exponents. Specifically, binomial(α, n) ≈ (-1)^{n} * Γ(n - α)/ (Γ(-α) Γ(n+1)) ), but maybe for large n, |binomial(α, n)| ~ C * n^{α -1} / n! ?\n\nWait, actually, for the generalized binomial coefficient, we have:\n\nbinomial(α, n) = α(α -1)...(α -n +1)/n!.\n\nFor large n, this behaves like (-1)^n * Γ(n - α) / (Γ(-α) Γ(n+1)) ). Using the approximation for Gamma functions, Γ(n - α) ≈ n^{-α} Γ(n), and Γ(n+1) = n!, so binomial(α, n) ≈ (-1)^n * n^{-α} / Γ(-α) * Γ(n)/n! ≈ (-1)^n * n^{-α -1} / Γ(-α), since Γ(n)/n! = 1/n.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to note that |binomial(α, n+1)| ≈ C * n^{α -1} as n → ∞. For example, when α is a positive integer, binomial coefficients become zero for n > α, but here α is any real number, so the coefficients don't terminate. For non-integer α, the coefficients decay like n^{-α -1}? Wait, perhaps for large n, binomial(α, n) behaves like O(n^{-α -1}).\n\nWait, let's write binomial(α, n+1) = [α(α -1)...(α -n)] / (n+1)!.\n\nThe numerator is α(α -1)...(α -n) = (-1)^{n+1} (n + 1 - α)(n - α)...(1 - α) α / α. Hmm, maybe another way. Alternatively, write the product as Γ(α +1)/Γ(α - n) ) / (n+1)!.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to note that for fixed α and large n, each term in the product α(α -1)...(α -n) is approximately (-1)^n n! / Γ(n +1 - α), but I might be getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio test for the binomial series. The binomial series sum_{n=0}^∞ binomial(α, n) x^n converges for |x| < 1. Therefore, the terms binomial(α, n) x^n → 0 as n → ∞. So |binomial(α, n+1) x^{n+1}| → 0. But in our remainder term, we have |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} |1 + ξ|^{α -n -1}.\n\nBut even if |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} goes to zero, if |1 + ξ|^{α -n -1} is growing, we need to check if the product still goes to zero. \n\nBut the user's progress for x > 0 uses the fact that x/(1 + hx) < x/(1 + x) = q < 1, so the remainder is bounded by |binomial(α, n+1)| q^{n+1} (1 + ξ)^α, which tends to zero because the binomial series converges at q. But for x negative, maybe we can find a similar bound.\n\nAlternatively, note that for x ∈ (-1, 0), we can write the remainder as R_n(x) = x^{n+1} binomial(α, n+1) (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1}. Let me take absolute values:\n\n|R_n(x)| = |x|^{n+1} |binomial(α, n+1)| |1 + ξ|^{α -n -1}.\n\nSince ξ is between x and 0, and x is negative, 1 + ξ is between 1 + x and 1. Let's let t = 1 + ξ, so t ∈ (1 + x, 1). Then |1 + ξ|^{α -n -1} = t^{α -n -1} = t^{- (n +1 - α)} = (1/t)^{n +1 - α}.\n\nSince t ≥ 1 + x > 0 (because x > -1), and since x is negative, 1 + x is between 0 and 1. Therefore, t ∈ (0, 1). Therefore, 1/t > 1. Hence, (1/t)^{n +1 - α} = (1/t)^{-α} * (1/t)^{n+1}. \n\nBut the problem is that (1/t)^{n+1} grows exponentially if 1/t > 1, but |x|^{n+1} decays exponentially. The question is whether |x|^{n+1} * (1/t)^{n+1} decays. If |x| * (1/t) < 1, then the product would decay. Let's see:\n\nSince t = 1 + ξ and ξ ∈ (x, 0), t > 1 + x. Therefore, 1/t < 1/(1 + x). So (1/t)^{n+1} < (1/(1 + x))^{n+1}.\n\nTherefore, |x|^{n+1} * (1/t)^{n+1} < |x|^{n+1} * (1/(1 + x))^{n+1} = (|x| / (1 + x))^{n+1}.\n\nBut since x is negative, |x| = -x. Let's substitute x = -y where y ∈ (0,1). Then |x| / (1 + x) = y / (1 - y). So we have (y / (1 - y))^{n+1}.\n\nNow, if y / (1 - y) < 1, then this term would decay exponentially. When is y / (1 - y) < 1? Solving:\n\ny / (1 - y) < 1 ⇒ y < 1 - y ⇒ 2y < 1 ⇒ y < 1/2 ⇒ x = -y > -1/2.\n\nTherefore, for x ∈ (-1/2, 0), this term (y/(1 - y))^{n+1} decays exponentially, so even multiplied by the binomial coefficient, which might be growing polynomially, the whole term would go to zero.\n\nBut for x ∈ [-1, -1/2], y ∈ [1/2, 1), so y/(1 - y) ≥ 1. In this case, (y/(1 - y))^{n+1} grows exponentially. Then how does the entire expression behave?\n\nBut wait, we also have the binomial coefficient |binomial(α, n+1)|. For large n, how does this behave? Let's approximate binomial(α, n+1):\n\nbinomial(α, n+1) = α(α -1)...(α -n) / (n+1)!.\n\nThe numerator is a product of (n+1) terms, each decreasing by 1. For large n, this product can be approximated using Gamma functions. Specifically, binomial(α, n+1) ≈ (-1)^{n+1} Γ(n +1 - α) / (Γ(-α) (n+1)!)). Using Stirling's approximation for Gamma functions, Γ(n +1 - α) ≈ n! n^{-α} (1 + O(1/n)). But Γ(n +1 - α) ≈ (n - α)! but shifted. Anyway, the leading term would be something like n^{-α -1} / some constants. Alternatively, using the relation between binomial coefficients and their decay.\n\nActually, for the binomial series sum_{k=0}^∞ binomial(α, k) x^k, the convergence for |x| < 1 is absolute. Therefore, the terms binomial(α, n+1) x^{n+1} must tend to zero as n → ∞. Hence, |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} → 0. \n\nBut in our case, the remainder term has an extra factor of (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1}, which complicates things. However, even if this term is growing, perhaps the decay of |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} is fast enough to compensate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can bound the remainder term using the original series. The user mentioned that the series converges for |x| < 1, so the partial sums converge, which implies that the remainder term (which is the tail of the series) must go to zero. But the problem is to show that the remainder term in Taylor's theorem goes to zero, which is equivalent to the series converging to the function. However, the user wants to do this directly via the remainder term without appealing to the convergence of the series.\n\nWait, but if we already know that the series converges for |x| < 1, then the remainder term R_n(x) = g_α(x) - sum_{k=0}^n binomial(α, k) x^k. Since the series converges, R_n(x) → 0 as n → ∞. However, maybe the question is to show this using the explicit form of the remainder (integral or Lagrange) without using the convergence of the series. The user seems to want to connect the remainder term's behavior to the series' convergence.\n\nBut perhaps for x negative, we can use a similar approach as for x positive. Let's take the Lagrange form:\n\n|R_n(x)| = |x|^{n+1} |binomial(α, n+1)| |1 + ξ|^{α -n -1}.\n\nWe can write this as |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} |1 + ξ|^{α} / |1 + ξ|^{n+1}.\n\nNow, since ξ is between x and 0, and x is negative, 1 + ξ is between 1 + x and 1. Let's denote t = 1 + ξ, so t ∈ (1 + x, 1). Then |1 + ξ| = t, and we have:\n\n|R_n(x)| = |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} t^{α} / t^{n+1} = |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} t^{α -n -1}.\n\nWait, but this is the same as before. To bound this, we can note that t ≥ 1 + x, so 1/t ≤ 1/(1 + x). Therefore, t^{α -n -1} = (1/t)^{n +1 - α} ≤ (1/(1 + x))^{n +1 - α}.\n\nThus:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} (1/(1 + x))^{n +1 - α}.\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n|binomial(α, n+1)| ( |x| / (1 + x) )^{n+1} (1 + x)^α.\n\nLet’s set q = |x| / (1 + x). For x ∈ (-1, 0), |x| = -x, so q = -x / (1 + x). Since x ∈ (-1,0), 1 + x > 0, so q = (-x)/(1 + x). Let’s substitute x = -y with y ∈ (0,1). Then q = y/(1 - y). Now, q is positive, and since y <1, q can be less than or greater than 1 depending on y. If y < 1/2, then q <1. If y ≥1/2, then q ≥1.\n\nBut even if q ≥1, the term q^{n+1} times |binomial(α, n+1)| needs to go to zero. However, since the binomial series sum_{k=0}^∞ binomial(α, k) x^k converges absolutely for |x| <1, then for any x in (-1,1), the terms binomial(α, n+1) x^{n+1} →0. But here we have an extra factor of (1 + x)^α and q^{n+1} which might be larger than |x|.\n\nWait, but in our case, q = |x| / (1 + x) = y / (1 - y). For x ∈ (-1,0), the corresponding q can be rewritten in terms of y. However, the convergence of the binomial series at q would require |q| <1, which is only true if y <1/2. But the user wants convergence for all |x| <1, including x ∈ [-1, -1/2].\n\nThis suggests that the approach used for x positive may not extend directly to x negative when |x| ≥1/2. But the user mentions that the series converges for |x| <1, so the remainder must go to zero. Therefore, there must be another way to bound this.\n\nPerhaps instead of bounding q, we can use the fact that the binomial coefficients times (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1} can be related to another binomial coefficient or use an inequality.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio test for the remainder term. Let’s look at the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n|R_n(x)| / |R_{n-1}(x)| = |binomial(α, n+1)/binomial(α, n)| * |x| * |t_n / t_{n-1}|^{α -n -1} where t_n = 1 + ξ_n.\n\nBut binomial(α, n+1) / binomial(α, n) = (α -n)/ (n+1). So the ratio is |(α -n)/(n+1)| * |x| * |t_n / t_{n-1}|^{α -n -1}.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, consider that for large n, binomial(α, n+1) ~ C n^{-α -1} and t^{ -n -1 + α} ~ (1 + x)^{-n} (since t ≥1 +x). So the term behaves like C n^{-α -1} |x|^{n} (1/(1 + x))^{n}.\n\nThe ratio |x|/(1 + x) = q as before. If q <1, this decays. If q ≥1, but even if q >=1, the term n^{-α -1} q^n, if q >1, this would grow, but if q=1, it decays like n^{-α -1}. However, for the binomial series, it's known to converge for |x| <1, so even when q >=1, the combination with the binomial coefficient must still go to zero.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle. The remainder term R_n(x) is equal to the tail of the binomial series starting from term n+1. Since the series converges, the tail must go to zero. Therefore, R_n(x) →0. But the problem is to show this using the explicit form of the remainder (Lagrange or integral form). The user wants to connect the remainder expression to the series' convergence.\n\nAlternatively, for the Lagrange remainder, we can write:\n\n|R_n(x)| = |x^{n+1} binomial(α, n+1) (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1}|.\n\nBut since the series converges, the term binomial(α, n+1) x^{n+1} →0. Now, we need to show that (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1} doesn't spoil this convergence. Since ξ is between x and 0, 1 + ξ is between 1 +x and 1. Let's denote 1 + ξ = s, so s ∈ (1 +x,1). Then (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1} = s^{α} / s^{n+1}. Therefore:\n\n|R_n(x)| = |x|^{n+1} |binomial(α, n+1)| s^{α} / s^{n+1} = |binomial(α, n+1)| (|x|/s)^{n+1} s^{α}.\n\nSince s >1 +x, and x is negative, |x| = -x, and s >1 +x =1 - y where y = -x ∈ (0,1). So s ∈ (1 - y,1), which means s >1 - y. Therefore, |x|/s = y/s < y/(1 - y) = q as before. But s >1 - y implies that |x|/s < y/(1 - y) = q. However, even if q >=1, the term (|x|/s)^{n+1} is multiplied by |binomial(α, n+1)|, which for the converging series must decay faster than any polynomial in n. \n\nAlternatively, since the binomial series converges absolutely, the terms |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} must go to zero. Therefore, even if s^{ -n -1} grows, but s is bounded below by 1 +x, which is a constant greater than 0, the decay of |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} should dominate. \n\nBut this is a bit hand-wavy. To make it rigorous, we can use the following:\n\nGiven that the binomial series converges absolutely for |x| <1, then for any |x| <1, the terms |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} →0 as n→∞. The factor (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1} can be bounded as follows:\n\nSince ξ is between x and 0, and x ∈ (-1,0), we have 1 + ξ ∈ (1 +x,1). Let’s denote s =1 + ξ, so s ∈ (1 +x,1). Then s >1 +x >0, and s <1. Therefore, s^{α -n -1} = s^{α} s^{-n -1}. Since s <1, s^{-n -1} = (1/s)^{n+1}, which grows exponentially. However, since |x| <1 and s ≥1 +x, we have:\n\n|x|/s ≤ |x|/(1 +x). \n\nBut for x negative, |x|/(1 +x) = y/(1 - y), y = -x ∈ (0,1). If this ratio is less than1, then (|x|/s)^{n+1} decays exponentially. But if the ratio is ≥1, we need another approach.\n\nHowever, regardless of the value of y, the binomial series converges at x, so |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} →0. The term s^{-n -1} = (1/s)^{n+1} ≤ (1/(1 +x))^{n+1} because s ≥1 +x. Thus:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ |binomial(α, n+1)| (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} (1 +x)^α.\n\nBut since the binomial series sum_{k=0}^∞ binomial(α, k) (|x|/(1 +x))^{k} converges because |x|/(1 +x) <1 when x ∈ (-1,0). Wait, no. If x is negative, |x|/(1 +x) = y/(1 - y), which as before, can be greater than1 if y >1/2. However, even if |x|/(1 +x) >=1, the convergence of the binomial series at that point is not guaranteed. This seems to complicate things.\n\nBut wait, the original binomial series converges at x, which is in (-1,1). Therefore, even if |x|/(1 +x) >=1, the term |binomial(α, n+1)| (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} must still go to zero because the series converges. This is because the convergence of the series at x implies that the terms must tend to zero, regardless of the ratio test. Hence, even if (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} grows, the binomial coefficient decays faster to zero.\n\nTherefore, combining these observations, we can argue that since the binomial series converges at x, the term |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} →0. The factor (1 + ξ)^{α -n -1} is bounded by (1 +x)^{α -n -1} (since ξ ≥x). Hence:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} (1 +x)^{α -n -1}.\n\nBut |x|^{n+1} (1 +x)^{-n -1} = (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} = (y/(1 - y))^{n+1} with y = -x.\n\nEven if y/(1 - y) ≥1, the term |binomial(α, n+1)| (y/(1 - y))^{n+1} must still go to zero because the binomial series converges at x = -y, so binomial(α, n+1) (-y)^{n+1} →0, implying that |binomial(α, n+1)| y^{n+1} →0. Therefore, multiplying by (1/(1 - y))^{n+1} could potentially grow, but since the original term tends to zero, even when multiplied by a term that grows at most exponentially, as long as the decay of the binomial term is faster. However, this is only possible if the growth factor (1/(1 - y))^{n+1} is counteracted by the decay of binomial(α, n+1) y^{n+1}.\n\nBut this requires a more precise analysis of the binomial coefficients' decay rate. For the generalized binomial coefficients, it's known that |binomial(α, n)| ~ C n^{-α -1} as n→∞. So |binomial(α, n+1)| y^{n+1} ~ C n^{-α -1} y^{n+1}. If we multiply this by (1/(1 - y))^{n+1}, we get C n^{-α -1} (y/(1 - y))^{n+1}. \n\nIf y/(1 - y) <1, this decays exponentially. If y/(1 - y) =1, then it's C n^{-α -1}, which decays. If y/(1 - y) >1, then it's C n^{-α -1} (something >1)^{n+1}, which grows exponentially. However, in this case, we have a contradiction unless such cases do not occur. But y/(1 - y) >1 corresponds to y >1/2, i.e., x ∈ (-1, -1/2). \n\nThis suggests that for x ∈ (-1, -1/2), the above bound would not work, but since we know the binomial series converges at x, there must be a different way to bound this. \n\nPerhaps instead of using the Lagrange form, we can use the integral form of the remainder. The integral form is:\n\nR_n(x) = ∫_0^x (x - t)^n / n! * (n+1)! binomial(α, n+1) (1 + t)^{α -n -1} dt.\n\nSimplifying, this becomes:\n\nR_n(x) = (n+1) binomial(α, n+1) ∫_0^x (x - t)^n (1 + t)^{α -n -1} dt.\n\nTaking absolute values:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ (n+1) |binomial(α, n+1)| ∫_0^x |x - t|^n |1 + t|^{α -n -1} dt.\n\nSince x is negative, t ranges from x to 0, so x - t is negative, and |x - t| = |x| - t (since t is negative). Wait, x is negative and t ∈ [x,0], so x - t is from x - x =0 to x -0 =x, which is negative. Therefore, |x - t| = |x| + |t| since t is negative. For example, x = -a (a >0), t = -b (b ∈ [0,a]), then x - t = -a - (-b) = -a + b = -(a - b), so |x - t| = a - b.\n\nBut 1 + t is in (1 +x,1). Let's make a substitution. Let t = -s where s ∈ [0, -x] (since x is negative). Then:\n\nR_n(x) = (n+1) binomial(α, n+1) ∫_{0}^{-x} (x + s)^n (1 - s)^{α -n -1} (-ds).\n\nBut since x is negative, x + s = s - |x|. Wait, perhaps this substitution complicates things. Alternatively, change variable to u = t -x. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that for x negative, the integral is from x to 0. Let's set t = x + u, where u goes from 0 to |x|. Then t = x + u, dt = du. Then:\n\nR_n(x) = (n+1) binomial(α, n+1) ∫_0^{|x|} (-u)^n (1 +x + u)^{α -n -1} du.\n\nTaking absolute value:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ (n+1) |binomial(α, n+1)| ∫_0^{|x|} u^n |1 +x + u|^{α -n -1} du.\n\nSince 1 +x + u =1 +x +u. Given that x ∈ (-1,0), and u ∈ (0, |x|), we have 1 +x +u ∈ (1 +x,1 +x +|x|). Since x is negative, |x| = -x, so 1 +x + |x| =1 +x -x =1. Therefore, 1 +x +u ∈ (1 +x,1). Let's denote s =1 +x +u, so s ∈ (1 +x,1). Then:\n\nu = s - (1 +x).\n\nBut this substitution might not help. Alternatively, note that s =1 +x +u <1, so |s|^{α -n -1} = s^{α -n -1} because s >0. Since s <1, s^{α -n -1} = s^{α} s^{-n -1} = s^{α} (1/s)^{n+1}.\n\nThus:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ (n+1) |binomial(α, n+1)| ∫_0^{|x|} u^n s^{α} (1/s)^{n+1} du.\n\nBut s =1 +x +u, and u ranges from0 to |x|, so s from1 +x to1. Therefore, 1/s ∈ (1,1/(1 +x)).\n\nLet’s bound 1/s ≤1/(1 +x) because s ≥1 +x. Therefore:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ (n+1) |binomial(α, n+1)| (1/(1 +x))^{n+1} ∫_0^{|x|} u^n (1 +x +u)^α du.\n\nThe integral ∫_0^{|x|} u^n (1 +x +u)^α du can be bounded by (1 +x +|x|)^α ∫_0^{|x|} u^n du = (1)^α * |x|^{n+1}/(n+1) = |x|^{n+1}/(n+1).\n\nThus:\n\n|R_n(x)| ≤ (n+1) |binomial(α, n+1)| (1/(1 +x))^{n+1} |x|^{n+1}/(n+1) = |binomial(α, n+1)| (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1}.\n\nBut this is the same bound as before. Hence, we end up with the same expression. However, since the binomial series converges at x, |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} →0. Therefore, even if (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} grows, the product must still go to zero. This requires that the decay of |binomial(α, n+1)| |x|^{n+1} is faster than the growth of (1/(1 +x))^{n+1}.\n\nBut this is equivalent to saying that |binomial(α, n+1)| (|x|/(1 +x))^{n+1} →0, which is the same as the convergence of the binomial series at the point |x|/(1 +x). However, unless |x|/(1 +x) <1, which only happens when |x| <1/2, we can’t directly use the convergence of the series. But since we know the original series converges at x, which may correspond to |x|/(1 +x) >=1, this suggests that the binomial coefficients must decay sufficiently fast to counteract the growth.\n\nThis seems to circle back to the original problem: how to show the remainder tends to zero without invoking the convergence of the series. However, the user's progress already uses the convergence of the series for x positive by relating the remainder to the tail of the series. For x negative, perhaps a similar approach can be used by considering absolute convergence.\n\nAlternatively, since the series converges absolutely for |x| <1, then the tail sum from n+1 to ∞ of |binomial(α, k) x^k| tends to zero. But the remainder term in the Lagrange form is exactly the tail of the series, so |R_n(x)| ≤ sum_{k=n+1}^∞ |binomial(α, k) x^k| →0. Therefore, the remainder must go to zero. However, this uses the convergence of the series, which the user might be aware of, but they want to connect it through the remainder's explicit form.\n\nIn summary, for x negative, the key is to bound the remainder term by the tail of the convergent series and use the fact that the tail must go to zero. Even if individual factors seem problematic, the overall convergence implies the remainder vanishes. Therefore, the answer should outline this reasoning, noting that the remainder is the tail of a convergent series hence tends to zero, possibly complementing with the estimation for x positive and extending it using absolute convergence for x negative.",
