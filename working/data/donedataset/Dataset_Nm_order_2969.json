    "Content": "Suppose that humanity haven't discovered Taylor Series Expansion of trigonometric functions or of any function that would help us on this. Which means we are not allowed to replace the given infinite series sums with the corresponding $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ functions. Could we still show that the following identity is true for all real $x$? $$ 1 - \\left( x - \\dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{x^5}{5!} - \\dfrac{x^7}{7!} + \\dots \\right)^2 = \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{x^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{x^4}{4!} - \\dfrac{x^6}{6!} + \\dots \\right)^2 $$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As Andres says in his comment, you can compare the coefficients of $x^{2k}$ in both quantities. On the left-hand side, this coefficient is $(-1)^k \\sum_{i+j=k-1} \\frac 1 {(2i+1)!(2j+1)!}$, while on the right-hand side, it is $(-1)^k \\sum_{i+j=k} \\frac 1{(2i)!(2j)!}$. Multiplying both coefficients by $(2k)!$, you are left to prove $\\sum \\binom {2k}{2i} = \\sum \\binom {2k}{2j+1}$, i.e. that the number of even subsets of a set of size $2k$ is the number of odd subsets. This is in fact true for any nonempty set, not only those of even size.\nTo show this combinatorially, pick a distinguished element $x$ of a set $S$ of size $n$. Then given a subset $X \\subset S$, map it either to $X \\setminus \\{ x \\}$ or to $X \\cup \\{x \\}$ according to wether $x \\in S$ or not. Then you can check that this is a bijection between odd-sized subsets of $S$ and even-sized subsets of $S$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether the identity between two infinite series (which we recognize as the squares of sine and cosine series) can be proven without using Taylor expansions. The key here is that they want to avoid replacing the series with sin x and cos x functions. The problem is to show that 1 minus the square of the odd-powered series equals the square of the even-powered series for all real x, without invoking Taylor series or knowledge of trigonometric functions.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem.\n\nAssumptions would include things like not using Taylor expansions, the series definitions given, and that x is a real number. Let me parse the original question for these.\n\nOriginal assumptions from the question:\n- Humanity hasn't discovered Taylor Series Expansion of trigonometric functions or any function that would help. So, we cannot replace the series with sin x or cos x.\n- The problem must be shown for all real x.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series $x - \\dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{x^5}{5!} - \\dots$ is defined without reference to Taylor expansions or trigonometric functions,\nThe series $1 - \\dfrac{x^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{x^4}{4!} - \\dots$ is defined without reference to Taylor expansions or trigonometric functions,\nThe problem must be proven without replacing the series with $\\sin x$ or $\\cos x$,\n$x$ is a real number.\n\nProblem: Show that $$ 1 - \\left( x - \\dfrac{x^3}{3!} + \\dfrac{x^5}{5!} - \\dots \\right)^2 = \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{x^2}{2!} + \\dfrac{x^4}{4!} - \\dots \\right)^2 $$ for all real $x$.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition on one object. The first two assumptions are about the definitions of the series, the third about the method restriction, and the fourth about x being real. That should cover all necessary points without overlap.",
