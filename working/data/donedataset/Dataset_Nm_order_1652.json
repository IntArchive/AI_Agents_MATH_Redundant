    "Content": "I am being asked to show that the groups axioms of existence of an identity, of inverses and of associativity are independent . Does this mean that none of two of them imply the third? That is: do I have to exhibit a \"bad\" group which has two but fails to have the third? (for each case) Or do I have to find examples also where one succeeds and the other two fail? ADD The axiom of inverses uses the axiom of the identity, so, how can the axiom of identity be independent of that of the inverses? Ans One can state the axiom of inverses without resorting to the notion of a unity. What does it mean, more formally, that a set of axioms is independent?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The set $\\mathcal{A}$ of axioms is independent if none of the elements of $\\mathcal{A}$ is a consequence of the others. More formally still, the condition is that for every $\\varphi\\in \\mathcal{A}$, the sentence $\\varphi$ is not a theorem of the theory with axiom set  $\\mathcal{A}\\setminus\\{\\varphi\\}$. That means your first interpretation is correct. To show independence, it is enough to produce for every $\\varphi$ a structure $M_{\\varphi}$ in which all the axioms in $\\mathcal{A}\\setminus\\{\\varphi\\}$ are true , but $\\varphi$ fails. This is a semantic argument. One can also imagine syntactic arguments, but semantic arguments are the mathematically natural ones.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about showing that the group axioms (identity, inverses, associativity) are independent. They want to know what exactly needs to be demonstrated and clarify some confusion regarding the dependency between axioms, especially since inverses are defined using the identity element.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question carefully. The main points are:\n\n1. The task is to show that the three group axioms (identity, inverses, associativity) are independent.\n2. The user is confused about whether independence means that no two axioms imply the third, requiring examples where two hold and the third fails for each case.\n3. There's a specific concern about the inverse axiom depending on the identity axiom, so how can identity be independent of inverses?\n4. The answer mentions stating inverses without the identity, which the user is asking to formalize the meaning of independence.\n\nThe user also references an answer that clarifies that inverses can be stated without a unity, which might mean that the usual formulation of inverses depends on identity, but perhaps there's a way to phrase it differently to remove that dependency.\n\nNow, structuring this into the required format: Assumptions and Problem.\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. The problem here is about the independence of axioms. So each axiom (identity, inverses, associativity) should be considered as separate assumptions. However, the confusion arises from the dependency between inverses and identity. The answer suggests that inverses can be defined without referencing the identity, which might be an assumption here.\n\nWait, the problem is about showing that each axiom is independent of the others. To do this, one needs to provide structures (magmas, semigroups, etc.) where two axioms hold and the third fails. But the user is confused because inverses typically require the identity element. The answer mentions that the inverse axiom can be restated without the identity, so perhaps the assumption here is that the axioms are formulated in a way that they don't implicitly depend on each other. However, in standard group axioms, inverses do depend on the identity. So maybe the key assumption is that the axioms are stated in a way that allows their independence, which might involve rephrasing the inverse axiom to not explicitly refer to the identity element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the assumption is that we are considering the standard group axioms, but even then, the question is about their independence. The answer points out that you can state inverses without identity, which might mean that in the context of the problem, the inverses axiom is formulated differently. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The axioms are considered in a modified form where inverses do not presuppose the existence of an identity element.\n- Each axiom (identity, inverses, associativity) must be shown to be independent of the others.\n- For each axiom, there exists a mathematical structure where the other two axioms hold, but the third does not.\n\nBut I need to extract the assumptions from the original problem, not my own reasoning. The original problem is asking how to show the axioms are independent, and the user is clarifying what that entails. The key points from the question are:\n\n- The user is to show that the three axioms are independent.\n- The user questions if this means that no two imply the third, hence requiring examples where two hold and the third fails for each case.\n- The user is confused because inverses use the identity, so how can identity be independent of inverses? The answer says inverses can be stated without identity, which is an important point.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would relate to the formal definition of independence of axioms: a set of axioms is independent if none can be derived from the others. Therefore, for each axiom, there must be a model where the other axioms hold but that one doesn't. The problem is to show that identity, inverses, and associativity are independent in this sense.\n\nBut the user's confusion is about the dependency between inverses and identity. The answer clarifies that inverses can be stated without the identity, which is a crucial assumption. Therefore, one assumption is that the inverse axiom is formulated without assuming the existence of an identity element. Otherwise, if inverses require identity, then identity cannot be independent because inverses would imply identity.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should include assumptions about how each axiom is stated, particularly that inverses do not presuppose identity. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that; it's part of the answer. So perhaps the assumption is that the axioms are formulated such that they can be independent, even if in standard group theory they are not. Alternatively, the problem assumes that the user needs to consider modified axioms where inverses don't depend on identity.\n\nBut the original question is about the standard group axioms. The answer says that you can state inverses without resorting to the identity, which is a way to make them independent. Therefore, the assumption here is that the inverse axiom is stated in a way that does not require the identity element. That's a key point because otherwise, the existence of inverses would imply the existence of an identity, making them dependent.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The axioms of identity, inverses, and associativity are considered for a set with a binary operation.\n- The inverse axiom is stated without assuming the existence of an identity element.\n- Each axiom must be shown to be independent of the other two.\n\nBut how to phrase this concisely in the assumption lines? Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n is divisible by 7\". Each line is a separate assumption.\n\nIn this case, the problem is to show the independence of the three group axioms. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The problem considers the three group axioms: existence of identity, existence of inverses, and associativity.\n- The axioms are formulated such that inverses do not presuppose the existence of an identity.\n- Each axiom must be independent of the others.\n\nBut wait, maybe more precisely:\n\n- Consider a set equipped with a binary operation.\n- The existence of an identity element is an axiom.\n- The existence of inverse elements is an axiom (formulated without reference to an identity).\n- Associativity is an axiom.\n- The set of these axioms is independent.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The axioms are considered in a context where inverse elements can exist without a prior assumption of an identity element.\n- For each axiom, there exists a mathematical structure where the other two axioms hold but the third fails.\n\nBut the user is being asked to show independence, so the assumptions are that each axiom is independent, which requires that for each, there's a structure where the other two hold but not that one. However, the user's confusion is about the dependency between inverses and identity. The answer explains that inverses can be stated without identity, which is an assumption here.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should include:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse axiom is stated without assuming the existence of an identity element.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state this; it's part of the answer. However, the user's question includes the answer's point, so perhaps that's part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking about the formal meaning of independence and how to show it, the assumptions are more about the task:\n\n- The problem requires demonstrating the independence of the three group axioms.\n- For each axiom, there exists a structure satisfying the other two but not that one.\n- The inverse axiom is formulated without relying on the identity axiom.\n\nBut how to extract this from the original question? The user says: \"the axiom of inverses uses the axiom of the identity, so, how can the axiom of identity be independent... Ans: One can state the axiom of inverses without resorting to the notion of a unity.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumption here is that the inverse axiom is formulated without reference to the identity element. This is critical to allow the independence. So this must be an assumption in the problem.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse axiom does not presuppose the existence of an identity element.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group axioms of existence of an identity, inverses, and associativity are independent.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"how does one show a set of axioms is independent? (of each other?)\" and then applies it to the group axioms. The specific problem is about the group axioms' independence.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem as per the user's original question is:\n\nProblem: Show that the group axioms (existence of identity, inverses, associativity) are independent.\n\nBut with the assumption that the inverse axiom is stated without reference to identity.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions are about the structure of the problem, not the mathematical content. But in the example given, the assumptions were mathematical conditions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the mathematical assumptions would be:\n\n- The binary operation is considered in structures where each axiom may or may not hold.\n- The inverse axiom is defined without requiring the existence of an identity element.\n\nBut I need to extract from the user's question and the given answer.\n\nThe user's problem is: How to show the group axioms are independent. The answer explains that you need to exhibit structures where two hold and the third fails. The user's confusion is about the dependency between inverses and identity, which is resolved by stating inverses without identity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would include that the inverse axiom is formulated without reference to identity, allowing it to be independent. Therefore, in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse axiom is defined without assuming the existence of an identity element.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the group axioms of existence of identity, existence of inverses, and associativity are independent.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show independence, the assumptions might be that each axiom is considered separately, and the task is to find for each one a structure where the others hold but it doesn't. But perhaps the key assumption is that inverses can be defined without identity.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The existence of an identity element is an axiom.\n- The existence of inverse elements is an axiom not requiring the identity element.\n- Associativity is an axiom.\n- Each axiom must be shown to be independent of the others.\n\nBut each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem considers three axioms: existence of identity, existence of inverses, and associativity.\nExistence of inverses is defined without reference to an identity element.\nFor each axiom, there exists a structure where the other two axioms hold but the third does not.\n\nBut the example given in the original query had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines.\n\nTherefore, for this problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe problem considers a set with a binary operation.\nThe existence of an identity element is an axiom.\nThe existence of inverse elements is an axiom formulated without assuming an identity.\nAssociativity is an axiom.\nThe task is to show each axiom is independent of the other two.\n\nBut the user's question is \"how does one show a set of axioms is independent?\" applied to the group axioms. The answer is that you need to show that for each axiom, there's a model where the others hold but it doesn't. Therefore, the assumptions would be the definitions required to pose the problem.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's conditions. Here, the problem is about the independence of axioms, so the assumptions are more about the framework: that the axioms are considered as separate, and inverses are defined without identity.\n\nHowever, the user's question includes the answer's note that inverses can be stated without identity, which is crucial for the independence. Therefore, this is an assumption for the problem.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse axiom is stated without using the concept of an identity element.\nProblem:\nShow that the group axioms (existence of identity, existence of inverses, associativity) are independent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more precise:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse element axiom does not presuppose the existence of an identity element.\nFor each axiom, a mathematical structure can be constructed where the other two axioms hold.\nProblem:\nDemonstrate that the group axioms of identity, inverses, and associativity are independent.\n\nBut each assumption line should be one point. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe inverse axiom is formulated without reference to an identity element.\nFor each axiom, there exists a structure satisfying the other two axioms.\nProblem:\nShow that the group axioms of identity, inverses, and associativity are independent.\n\nBut the second assumption is part of what needs to be shown, not an assumption. Hmm. Maybe only the first assumption is needed: that the inverse axiom is stated without identity. Because without that, you can't have inverses without identity, making them dependent.\n\nTherefore, the key assumption here is that the inverse axiom is defined in a way that doesn't require an identity. The problem is to show that under this assumption, the three axioms are independent.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe axiom of inverses is stated without assuming the existence of an identity element.\nProblem:\nShow that the group axioms (existence of identity, inverses, associativity) are independent.",
