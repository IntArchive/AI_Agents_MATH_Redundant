    "AcceptedAnswer": "Expanding the inverse tangent in logarithms, writing $\\frac{x}{1+x^2}=\\Re\\frac1{x-i}$, and expanding $\\log(1-x^2)=\\log(1-x)+\\log(1+x)$, each of the resulting four indefinite integrals has a closed form. Each term is amenable to automatic integration, ( an example ), which means that after taking limits, slogging through simplifications and special values, such as those found here , the closed form can be computed. For example, for the term above,\n$$ \\int_0^1\\frac{\\log(1-ix)\\log(1-x)}{x-i}\\,dx =\n-\\frac{K\\pi }{4}-\\frac{17 i \\pi ^3}{384}-\\frac{1}{2} i K \\log2+\\frac{13}{192} \\pi ^2 \\log2+\\frac{3}{32} i \\pi  (\\log2)^2-\\frac{(\\log2)^3}{48}+3 \\,\\text{Li}_3({\\textstyle\\frac{1+i}{2}})-\\frac{45 \\zeta(3)}{32}.\n$$ Now, the integrand of the integral in question is the real part of the sum\n$$ \\frac i2 \\frac{\\log(1-ix)\\log(1-x)}{x-i} - \\frac i2\\frac{\\log(1+i x)\\log(1-x)}{x-i}+\\frac i2\\frac{\\log(1-ix)\\log(1+x)}{x-i}-\\frac i2\\frac{\\log(1+ix)\\log(1+x)}{x-i},\n$$\nwhere each term has a closed form for its integral, as above, in terms of $\\pi$, $K$, $\\log 2$ and $\\text{Li}_3$. After sufficient simplification, the integral of that sum is\n$$\\begin{aligned} &\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\arctan x\\log(1-x^2)}{x-i}\\,dx = \\\\\n&-\\frac{1}{4} i K\\pi -\\frac{\\pi ^3}{48}+\\frac{1}{32} i \\pi ^2 \\log2-\\frac{1}{8} \\pi  (\\log2)^2+K \\log2+\\frac{7}{32} i \\zeta(3), \\end{aligned}$$\nof which the real part gives the answer\n$$ -\\frac{\\pi ^3}{48}-\\frac{1}{8} \\pi  (\\log2)^2+ K \\log2$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original problem is about evaluating a definite integral from 0 to 1 of a function involving x, arctan x, log(1 - x²), all divided by 1 + x². The user also mentions an attempted substitution using x = tanθ, transforming the integral into two separate integrals over θ from 0 to π/4. The goal is to prove the integral equals a specific expression involving π³, π, log²2, and Catalan's constant G.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse through the problem statement:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to 1. So, assumption: The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n2. The integrand is (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²). So, assumption: The integrand is (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²).\n3. The substitution used is x = tanθ, leading to the transformed integrals. However, the substitution is part of the user's attempt, not an assumption given by the problem. The problem itself doesn't state this substitution as a given condition, so maybe it's part of their approach. The problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression, so the substitution is part of their method, not an assumption. Therefore, maybe we don't include the substitution in assumptions unless the problem statement enforces it. The original problem doesn't specify using that substitution; the user tried it. So, perhaps the substitution is part of their approach, not an assumption of the problem. Thus, the integral is presented in terms of x, and the problem is to evaluate it as is, unless the problem statement says \"using substitution x = tanθ\", but the original problem doesn't. The user is asking for a good approach, possibly different from their substitution.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The variable x is integrated from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is the given function: (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²).\n- The integral is to be proven equal to the expression involving π³, π, log²2, and G.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that the integral equals that expression. So the assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. Since it's an integral from 0 to 1 of that function, perhaps the main assumption is the integrand is defined and integrable over [0,1]. However, since the user didn't mention any restrictions (like convergence), but in the example provided, the assumptions were on n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the integral's bounds and the integrand's form are the main assumptions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. However, in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which might not require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" However, the formatted problem added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption should just be that n is an integer, without needing n divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like an error. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user in the example miswrote it. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That's conflicting. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem as per the format, listing each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, for the current integral problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated from 0 to 1.\n2. The integrand is (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²).\n3. The substitution x = tanθ is applied (if considered part of the problem's given conditions). Wait, the problem statement says \"Using the substitution x=tanθ, it can be written as...\" So the user transformed the integral using substitution, but the original problem didn't specify that substitution. So the substitution is part of their attempt, not an assumption given by the problem. Therefore, the problem is to evaluate the original integral, and the user is providing their transformed version. Therefore, the substitution is part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the problem's assumptions are just the integral's limits and integrand.\n\nAdditionally, the problem involves Catalan's constant G, which is a defined constant, so no assumption needed there. The equality to be proven is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n2. The integrand is (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem didn't have an assumption on n being divisible by 7 but the formatted problem added it. Wait, maybe there was a miscommunication. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not restricted to multiples of 7. However, 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the user intended to factor that into assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a typo or the example is incorrect. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction to list assumptions as per the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is given as is, with the substitution being part of the user's attempt. So the substitution isn't an assumption, it's part of their approach.\n\nHence, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. The integral is from 0 to 1.\n2. The integrand is (x arctan x log(1 - x²))/(1 + x²).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Prove that [integral] equals [expression]\". Therefore, the integral is defined with those limits and integrand. So the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. Therefore, each line should list a single condition.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{x \\arctan x \\log(1 - x^2)}{1 + x^2}$,\nThe expression to prove is $-\\frac{\\pi^3}{48} - \\frac{\\pi}{8}\\log^2 2 + G \\log 2$ where $G$ is Catalan's Constant.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were on the variables (n is integer, etc.), not on the desired result. Wait, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem that the objects must satisfy, not the conclusion. For instance, in the example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, so the assumption is that n is an integer. The formatted example incorrectly added \"n is divisible by 7\", but that was a mistake. However, the user might have intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not derived ones. Therefore, for the integral problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The variable x ranges from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is as specified.\n- Catalan's Constant G is used in the expression.\n\nBut the problem states that G is Catalan's constant, which is a defined constant, so perhaps it's not an assumption but a definition. Therefore, the main assumptions are about the integral's limits and integrand.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is $\\frac{x \\arctan x \\log(1 - x^2)}{1 + x^2}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals $-\\frac{\\pi^3}{48} - \\frac{\\pi}{8}\\log^2 2 + G \\log 2$ where $G$ is Catalan's Constant.\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions, each on one line, so here we can split into two assumptions: integral from 0 to 1, and the integrand's form. The substitution is part of the user's attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The expression to prove is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{x \\arctan x \\log(1 - x^2)}{1 + x^2}$.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\int_0^1 \\frac{x \\arctan x \\log \\left( 1-x^2\\right)}{1+x^2}dx = -\\frac{\\pi^3}{48}-\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\log^2 2 +G\\log 2$$ where $G$ is the Catalan's Constant.\n###",
