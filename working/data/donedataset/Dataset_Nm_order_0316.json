    "Content": "A professor knows $9$ jokes and tells $3$ jokes per lecture.\n  Prove that in a course of $13$ lectures there is going to be a pair of jokes that will be told together in at least $2$ lectures. I've started with counting how many possibilities there are to tell jokes in a lecture. Let $$J := \\{1,2,\\dots,9\\}$$ The amount of all different possible combinations for jokes is $9 \\choose 3$ and for each lecture there are going to be $3$ unique pairs of jokes $\\left(\\frac{3!}{2!}=3\\right)$. I'm not sure how to continue from here to get to the PHP, I think I might be doing something wrong here, any advice how to abstract it properly? This is an exercise from the Tel-Aviv University entry test preparation and I'm not a student yet so elementry combinatorics should do here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will assume that he doesn't tell the same joke twice (or three times) in the same lecture. Else, here is a counterexample: Let $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_9\\}$ be the set of jokes. On the $i$-th day for $1 \\leq i \\leq 9$, tell jokes $(a_i, a_i, a_i)$. Then tell $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$, $(a_4, a_5, a_6)$, $(a_7, a_8, a_9)$ and $(a_1, a_4, a_7)$. So, now towards the exercise. Every day the professor tells $3$ distinct pairs of jokes. Which means in total he tells $39$ pairs of jokes over the $13$ days. There are $\\frac{9!}{7!2!}= 36$ pairs of jokes he can tell. So he must tell at least one pair of jokes twice.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the professor knows 9 jokes and tells 3 jokes per lecture. We need to prove that over 13 lectures, there must be at least one pair of jokes that are told together in at least two lectures.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The key here is to use the pigeonhole principle, which basically says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. In this case, the \"pigeons\" are the lectures, and the \"pigeonholes\" are the possible pairs of jokes.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each lecture consists of 3 jokes, and each set of 3 jokes can form 3 unique pairs. For example, if the jokes are A, B, C, the pairs are AB, AC, and BC. So each lecture contributes 3 pairs. Over 13 lectures, that's 13*3 = 39 pairs. Now, how many possible unique pairs of jokes are there in total? Since there are 9 jokes, the number of possible pairs is C(9,2) which is 36. \n\nSo we have 39 pairs (pigeons) and 36 possible pair slots (pigeonholes). By the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair must be repeated. That is, some pair is told in at least two lectures. Because 39 divided by 36 is more than 1, so one of the pairs must be used at least twice.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The total number of pairs possible is 36. Each lecture gives 3 pairs. Over 13 lectures, 13*3=39 pairs. So 39 pairs distributed over 36 possible. Therefore, by PHP, there must be at least one pair that occurs at least ceil(39/36) = 2 times. Therefore, proven.\n\nBut the user mentioned they started by calculating the number of possible combinations for jokes, which is C(9,3)=84. But maybe that's complicating things. The key is to think in terms of pairs, not triplets. Each lecture has 3 pairs, so total pairs over 13 lectures is 39. Since there are only 36 possible pairs, 39>36, so one pair must repeat.\n\nSo the assumptions would be: the professor tells 3 unique jokes per lecture, each pair of jokes can be considered as a unique entity, and the total number of possible pairs is fixed. Then the problem is to apply PHP with these numbers.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the required format:\n\nAssumptions: Each lecture consists of 3 unique jokes,\nEach lecture contains 3 unique pairs of jokes,\nThe total number of possible unique pairs of jokes is 36,\nThe total number of pairs told over 13 lectures is 39.\n\nProblem: Prove that in a course of 13 lectures, there exists at least one pair of jokes told together in at least 2 lectures.\n\nThat seems to cover the necessary assumptions and the problem statement.",
