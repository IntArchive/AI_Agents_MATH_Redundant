    "Content": "In 1752 Goldbach send this conjecture to Euler: \"Every odd integer can be written in the form $p+2a^2$ where $p$ is a prime or $1$ and $a$ is a natural number (can be even 0).\" This conjecture turned out to be false and my book asks me to prove that $5777$ cannot be written in such manner. What I did is simply noted that if exists such $p$ it must be of the form $5777-2a^2$ and so $a$ mustn't be greater than $53$. Then I simply checked that for every values of $a$ from $0$ to $53$ $p$ is not prime. Btw this is a very tedious way to prove this and may in a test I wouldn't be able to do this so I was wondering if there was any shorter way? (or my book just wanted me to make a lot of calculations for some reason.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Observe that $5777\\equiv 2\\pmod 3$ and $2a^2\\equiv 2\\pmod 3$ unless $3\\mid a$. Hence once you check that $5777-3$ is not twice a square, you need only check $a$ with $3\\mid a$ (cutting down the effort by two thirds). Likewise, $5777\\equiv 2\\pmod 5$, which allows you to drop all cases where $a\\equiv \\pm1\\pmod 5$ (after checking that $5777-5$ is not twice a square).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that 5777 cannot be written in the form p + 2a² where p is a prime or 1, and a is a natural number (including 0). The user tried checking all a from 0 to 53 and found that p is never prime, but they want a more efficient method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The problem states that Goldbach's conjecture is false for 5777, and the task is to prove it. The assumptions here are about the form p + 2a² where p is a prime or 1, and a is a natural number (which includes 0). \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The number in question is 5777.\n2. p is either a prime number or 1.\n3. a is a natural number, which can be 0.\n4. The equation to consider is 5777 = p + 2a².\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem statement is to show that 5777 cannot be expressed in that form. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions that the user checked all a from 0 to 53, which is because a² can't exceed 5777/2. So the maximum a is sqrt(5777/2) ≈ 53.7, hence a ≤53. But in the assumptions, do I need to include that a is between 0 and 53? Or is that part of the problem-solving process rather than the problem's inherent assumptions? The problem's assumptions are about the form, so the main conditions are p being prime or 1, a being a natural number, and the equation. The range of a is derived from the equation, so maybe it's not an assumption but a consequence. Therefore, the assumptions should just be the ones given in the problem statement, not the derived ones.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- 5777 is the number to be expressed.\n- p is a prime number or 1.\n- a is a natural number (including 0).\n- The expression is 5777 = p + 2a².\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n5777 is an odd integer,\np is a prime number or 1,\na is a natural number (including 0),\n5777 = p + 2a².\n\nBut wait, the original conjecture is about every odd integer, so 5777 being odd is part of the problem's context. However, the problem specifically asks to prove that 5777 cannot be written in that form. So the assumptions would include that we are trying to write 5777 as p + 2a² with p prime or 1 and a natural number. The problem is to show that no such p and a exist.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n5777 is the integer to be expressed,\np is a prime number or 1,\na is a natural number (including 0),\n5777 = p + 2a².\n\nProblem: Prove that 5777 cannot be written as p + 2a² where p is a prime or 1 and a is a natural number.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in that problem, the original assumption was that for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they listed the specific assumptions made. Wait, the example might have been a mistake. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, the original problem didn't specify that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which changes the problem. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow it.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That actually changes the problem. So maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user intended that? Or perhaps there was a misunderstanding. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions based on their example.\n\nBut in the given example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. So the user is restructuring the problem by adding assumptions, possibly narrowing down the original problem. But in the case of the current problem about 5777, the original problem is to prove that 5777 cannot be written as p + 2a² with p prime or 1 and a natural number. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem: p is prime or 1, a is natural number including 0, and 5777 = p + 2a². The problem is to prove that no such p and a exist.\n\nBut the example included assumptions that were not all from the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. However, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions should include all conditions, even those that are part of the problem's general statement. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem, even if they were not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem's context.\n\nWait, the example's original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption includes n being an integer and n divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13. So perhaps the original problem's solution requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but the example might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem about 5777, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem is to prove that 5777 cannot be written as p + 2a² where p is a prime or 1, and a is a natural number (including 0). Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The number to be expressed is 5777.\n- p is a prime number or 1.\n- a is a natural number (including 0).\n- The equation 5777 = p + 2a² must hold.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So formatting that:\n\nAssumption:\n5777 is the number to be expressed,\np is a prime number or 1,\na is a natural number (including 0),\n5777 = p + 2a².\n\nProblem: Prove that 5777 cannot be written in the form p + 2a² under the given assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement can be phrased as in the example, where the problem is to prove the non-existence of such p and a. The example's problem statement was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" Here, it would be \"Prove that 5777 cannot be written [...]\".\n\nSo putting it all together, following the example's structure, the formatted problem should list the assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.",
