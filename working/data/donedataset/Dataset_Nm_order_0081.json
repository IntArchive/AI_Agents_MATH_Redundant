    "Content": "It is suggested as an exercise in Serge Lang's book \"Algebra\" to show that the commutator subgroup $G^c$ of a group $G$ is a normal subgroup. I'd like to do that but I am afraid I need help, I think the first thing I need to figure out is how a general element in the commutator subgroup looks like, so that I can check that the defining condition for normality is satisfied. That is, supposing for a moment that a general element in $G^c$ is denoted by $g$, I need to show that $aga^{-1} \\in G^c,$ for all $a \\in G$. But here I get stuck, first because I am unsure how to write a general element in $G^c$ - a simple product in $G^c$ is of the form $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ where $a,b \\in G$. I cannot see a way to simplify this - I am sure there is one, but somehow I am blind today. The second thing then is, even if one tries out the conjugation of a simple element like $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ in $G^c$, again not simplification offers itself easily I think .. what am I missing ? An alternative would be to find a homomorphism of $G$ whose kernel is precisely $G^c$ - here I tried to think of this as a map $G \\times G \\to G$ but whatever I cook up is not a homomorphism. Thanks for your hints !!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Denote the commutator of $a$ and $b$ by $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab = [a,b]$. If $u$ is an element from the commutator subgroup, then $g^{-1}ug = u(u^{-1}g^{-1}ug) = u[u, g]$ . Another approach: the commutator subgroup is defined to be the subgroup generated by the commutators, so every element of the commutator subgroup is of the form $$[a_1, b_1][a_2,b_2]\\ldots[a_n, b_n].$$ It is enough to show that $g^{-1}[a,b]g$ is always in the commutator subgroup, because then $$g^{-1}[a_1, b_1][a_2,b_2]\\ldots[a_n, b_n]g = (g^{-1}[a_1, b_1]g)(g^{-1}[a_2,b_2]g)(g^{-1}\\ldots g)(g^{-1}[a_n, b_n]g)$$ is a product of elements from the commutator subgroup. When $\\phi$ is any homomorphism, we have $\\phi([a,b]) = [\\phi(a), \\phi(b)]$. Since for any $g \\in G$ the map $\\phi$ defined by $\\phi(x) = g^{-1}xg$ is a homomorphism, the result follows.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about showing that the commutator subgroup G^c is a normal subgroup of G, as an exercise from Lang's Algebra. The main issue they're having is figuring out how to approach the proof, particularly because they're unsure about the structure of elements in G^c and how conjugation affects them.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that a general element in G^c is a product of commutators, like xyx^{-1}y^{-1}aba^{-1}b^{-1}, but they can't see how to simplify this. They tried conjugating a single commutator, like conjugating xyx^{-1}y^{-1} by some a in G, but didn't see the simplification. Alternatively, they thought about finding a homomorphism with kernel G^c but struggled there too.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that G^c is normal in G. The key points here are the definition of the commutator subgroup and the properties of normal subgroups. The commutator subgroup is generated by all commutators [x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1} for x, y in G. To show normality, they need to show that for any a in G and any element in G^c, the conjugate a g a^{-1} is also in G^c, where g is a product of commutators.\n\nThe user's confusion is about handling a general element of G^c, which is a product of commutators, and how conjugation affects such elements. The solution likely involves showing that the conjugate of a commutator is another commutator (up to products of commutators), so that conjugating any product of commutators remains in G^c. Alternatively, since G^c is generated by commutators, it's enough to show that conjugates of generators are in G^c, which would imply the subgroup is normal.\n\nAnother approach the user mentions is finding a homomorphism whose kernel is G^c. The natural choice would be the abelianization of G, i.e., the quotient map G → G/G^c, since G/G^c is abelian, and the kernel is exactly G^c. If they can show this map is a homomorphism, then G^c is normal as the kernel of a homomorphism. But maybe the user hasn't considered that the quotient map itself is the homomorphism needed.\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the required format. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a group.\n2. G^c is the commutator subgroup of G, generated by all commutators [x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1} for x, y in G.\n3. The problem is to prove that G^c is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this case, the original problem as stated in the title and the question is just to show that the commutator subgroup is normal. The assumptions here are inherent in the definitions: G is a group, G^c is its commutator subgroup. But the user's problem might not have additional assumptions beyond that. The original problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on G, like being finite or abelian, so the assumptions are just that G is a group and G^c is its commutator subgroup. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those as assumptions.\n\nBut the user's attempt to solve the problem might involve trying to take a general element in G^c (which is a product of commutators) and conjugate by an arbitrary element of G. The key insight is that conjugating a commutator [x,y] by a in G gives [a x a^{-1}, a y a^{-1}], which is another commutator in G^c, so the conjugate of any generator of G^c is in G^c, hence the subgroup is normal. Alternatively, since G^c is generated by commutators, and normality can be checked on generators.\n\nAlternatively, since the quotient G/G^c is abelian, the kernel of the quotient map is G^c, hence G^c is normal.\n\nSo the problem, after filtering the user's thought process and their uncertainties, is to prove that the commutator subgroup G^c is normal in G. The assumptions needed are just the basic definitions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG^c is the commutator subgroup of G.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G^c is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nI need to check the example given. In the example, the original problem mentions that n is an integer, but the user in their problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, the example might have had an error. Wait, the original problem in the example was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem had assumptions:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, the original problem says divisible by 91, but 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem was misformatted. Hmm, maybe the user's example had a typo. But regardless, in the current problem, the user's question is about the commutator subgroup being normal, and the key assumptions are that G is a group, and G^c is its commutator subgroup. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those as assumptions.",
