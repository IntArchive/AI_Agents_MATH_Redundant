    "Content": "(I give a lengthy introduction to a concise question -- scroll down if you want to jump straight up to the question). Recall that abelian group theory consists of two primitive symbols: $\\cdot$ which is a binary function symbol, and $e$ which is a constant. The axioms are: ( $G_1$ ) $\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z \\ \\ x\\cdot (y\\cdot z)=(x\\cdot y)\\cdot z$ ( $G_2$ ) $\\forall x \\ \\ x\\cdot e=x$ ( $G_3$ ) $\\forall x \\exists y \\ \\ x\\cdot y=e$ ( $G_4$ ) $\\forall x \\forall y \\ \\ x\\cdot y =y \\cdot x$ A set of axioms $\\Phi$ is independent if for every $\\varphi\\in \\Phi$ there exists an interpretation $\\mathcal{I}$ such that $\\mathcal{I} \\models \\Phi\\setminus \\{\\varphi\\}$ and $\\mathcal{I}\\not\\models \\varphi$ . In non-formal logic language, $\\mathcal{I}\\models \\Phi$ means: exhibit a set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ and an element $e\\in G$ such that all axioms in $\\Phi$ are satisfied (taking the variables as belonging to $G$ ). So, to prove that the above axioms are independent is to exhibit, for every $i=1,\\dots,4$ , a set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ and an element $e\\in G$ such that $(G_j)$ holds for every $j\\not=i$ , and $(G_i)$ does not hold. Thusly you prove that you can't prove $(G_i)$ from $\\{(G_j), j\\not=i\\}$ . A cute and fun problem in Ebbinghaus, Mathematical Logic (exercise 4.14, p. 39) asks us to prove that the group theory axioms, i.e. $\\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3)\\}$ is an independent set of axioms. This is fun to do. But then the natural follow-up question that occurred to me is: is $\\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3) ,(G_4)\\}$ an independent set of axioms? For $i=2,3,4$ it is easy to prove that there are models of $\\{(G_j):j\\not=i\\}$ where $(G_i)$ does not hold. (In fact, for $i=2,3$ , the ones I have thought for the exercise in Ebbinghaus were all commutative, and thus worked; for $i=4$ it's just the existence of non-abelian groups). But for $i=1$ I'm having a really hard time. I tried a lot of examples, neither of which works. To sum up, I'm trying to prove that: There exists a set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that: $\\cdot$ is not associative, $\\cdot$ is commutative, there is an identity element $e$ , and every element has an inverse with respect to $e$ . The best I could do was the following. Take $G=\\mathbb{R}^2$ , with $(a,b)\\cdot (c,d)=(ac+bd,0)$ . It is commutative, not associative, the inverse with respect to $(0,0)$ is $(b,-a)$ , but $(a,b)\\cdot (0,0)=(0,0)$ , not $(a,b)$ , whence $(0,0)$ is not an identity element. Or perhaps I'm just wrong and $(G_2), (G_3), (G_4)$ imply $(G_1)$ , which would come off as a surprise.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the non-negative integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ with the binary operation $|x - y|$. This is obviously commutative. The identity is $0$ and every element is its own inverse, but $||1 - 1| - 2| = 2 \\neq |1 - |1 - 2|| = 0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about the independence of the axioms for abelian group theory. Specifically, they want to know if each axiom (G1 to G4) can't be proven from the others. The challenge seems to be with showing that associativity (G1) isn't implied by the other axioms (G2, G3, G4). \n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem is about finding a structure that satisfies G2 (identity), G3 (inverses), G4 (commutativity), but not G1 (associativity). So the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The operation is commutative (G4).\n- There exists an identity element (G2).\n- Every element has an inverse (G3).\n- The operation is not associative (negation of G1).\n\nThe problem is to prove the existence of such a structure, which would show that G1 is independent of the other axioms. \n\nThe user tried an example with ℝ² and a custom operation but realized the identity element wasn't working. Maybe they need a different operation. Let me think of possible examples. \n\nOne approach is to take a known commutative structure with identity and inverses but not associative. Maybe a loop that's commutative but not a group? For example, consider a modified addition or multiplication. Alternatively, use a finite set. \n\nWait, in the example given by the user, the identity element didn't work because (a,b)⋅(0,0) wasn't (a,b). So they need a structure where there's an e such that x⋅e = x for all x, commutative, each x has an inverse, but the operation isn't associative. \n\nPerhaps using a different binary operation. Let's think of a commutative quasigroup with identity and inverses but not associative. Maybe something like a*b = a + b + ab in some structure, but check associativity. Or maybe a different construction. \n\nAlternatively, take a three-element set {e, a, b} and define a commutative operation with e as identity, each element has an inverse, but the operation isn't associative. Let's try to construct such a table.\n\nDefine * such that:\n\n- e is the identity: e*x = x*e = x for all x.\n- a*a = e (so a is its own inverse)\n- a*b = b*a = e (since commutative)\n- b*b = e (so b is its own inverse)\n\nNow check associativity. For example, (a*a)*b = e*b = b. On the other hand, a*(a*b) = a*e = a. But b ≠ a, so associativity fails. Wait, but this would require that a*a = e and a*b = e. But then if we have a*b = e, then b is the inverse of a. But in this case, a and b are inverses of each other. However, since the operation is commutative, inverses are two-sided. But in this setup, a*(a*b) = a*e = a, and (a*a)*b = e*b = b. So associativity fails. But does this structure satisfy G2, G3, G4?\n\nYes: G2 (e is identity), G4 (commutative), G3 (each element has an inverse: a's inverse is a (since a*a=e) but wait, a*b=e, so does that mean b is also the inverse of a? Wait, in a group, inverses are unique, but here it's not a group. So if a*b = e and a*a = e, then a has two inverses? But the axioms only require existence of an inverse, not uniqueness. So that's okay. But in this case, the operation is commutative, there's an identity, every element has at least one inverse, but the operation is not associative. So this seems to work. \n\nWait, but does this structure actually work? Let's check all possible associativities. For example, (a*b)*a = e*a = a. a*(b*a) = a*e = a. So that's associative here. Hmm, maybe this example isn't sufficient. Let's try another triplet. Let's consider (a*a)*a = e*a = a, and a*(a*a) = a*e = a. Not helpful. What about (a*b)*a vs a*(b*a). Wait, since it's commutative, a*b = b*a. So (a*b)*a = a*(b*a) = a*(a*b) = same. Maybe this example doesn't show non-associativity. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think differently. Maybe use a known algebraic structure that's commutative, has identity and inverses, but isn't associative. For example, consider the integers modulo n with a different operation. Or maybe something like a commutative loop that isn't associative.\n\nAnother idea: Take the real numbers except for some element, define a*b = a + b - 1. Then the identity is 1, since a*1 = a +1 -1 = a. Inverse of a is 2 - a, since a*(2 -a) = a + (2 -a) -1 = 1. This operation is commutative. Is it associative? Let's check: (a*b)*c = (a + b -1)*c = (a + b -1) + c -1 = a + b + c - 2. On the other hand, a*(b*c) = a + (b + c -1) -1 = a + b + c -2. So it is associative. So that's a group isomorphic to addition, so associativity holds. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if I take a*b = (a + b)/2. Then it's commutative. Is there an identity? Let’s see: a*e = (a + e)/2 = a ⇒ a + e = 2a ⇒ e = a. So only possible if e = a for all a, which is impossible unless the set is trivial. So no identity element. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: Take a set with elements {e, a, b} and define the operation such that e is the identity, commutative, each element has an inverse, but not associative. Let's try:\n\n* | e  a  b\n-----------\ne | e  a  b\na | a  b  e\nb | b  e  a\n\nThis is similar to Z/3Z under addition, but let's check associativity. For example, (a*a)*b = b*b = a. a*(a*b) = a*e = a. So a ≠ a, which is a problem. Wait, no: (a*a)*b = (b)*b = a. a*(a*b) = a*e = a. So (a*a)*b = a, and a*(a*b) = a. Wait, that's the same. Maybe another combination. Let's take (a*b)*a = e*a = a. a*(b*a) = a*e = a. Hmm. Not helpful. Another example: (a*b)*a vs a*(b*a). Since it's commutative, both are the same. So maybe this structure is associative. Maybe this is a group. So it's associative. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need a different structure. Let's think of a commutative operation where associativity fails. For example, take the integers with a*b = a - b. But this is not commutative. Alternatively, a*b = |a| + |b|. Then it's commutative, identity? a*e = |a| + |e| = a. This would require |e| = a - |a|, which is only possible if a is non-negative and e=0. But for negative a, it's not possible. So no identity. \n\nAlternatively, consider a*b = a + b + ab. Let's check associativity: (a*b)*c = (a + b + ab) + c + (a + b + ab)c = a + b + ab + c + ac + bc + abc. a*(b*c) = a + (b + c + bc) + a(b + c + bc) = a + b + c + bc + ab + ac + abc. These are equal, so it's associative. So this forms a group isomorphic to multiplicative group via x ↦ x + 1. So not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe consider a structure where the operation is commutative, has identity and inverses, but not associative. Let's think of a finite example. Take the set {e, a, b} with e as identity. Define:\n\na*a = e\na*b = b*a = e\nb*b = e\n\nThen, every element is its own inverse (since a*a = e, b*b = e) but wait, a*b = e, so does that mean a and b are inverses? But since the operation is commutative, that's allowed. Now check associativity. Let's take (a*a)*b = e*b = b. a*(a*b) = a*e = a. So (a*a)*b ≠ a*(a*b). Therefore, associativity fails here. \n\nBut in this case, does the operation have an identity? Yes, e. Every element has an inverse: a has inverse a (since a*a = e) and also b (since a*b = e). Wait, but inverses are not required to be unique in the axioms. The axioms only state that there exists at least one inverse. So in this case, each element has an inverse. However, the problem is that the operation is not associative. So this structure satisfies G2, G3, G4 but not G1. Therefore, such a structure exists. \n\nBut wait, does this operation actually work? Let's check all possible combinations. The operation table would be:\n\n* | e  a  b\n-----------\ne | e  a  b\na | a  e  e\nb | b  e  e\n\nWait, but a*b = e and b*a = e (commutative), and a*a = e, b*b = e. Then, let's verify associativity for other triplets. For example, (a*b)*a = e*a = a. a*(b*a) = a*e = a. So that's associative. How about (a*b)*b = e*b = b. a*(b*b) = a*e = a. So here, b ≠ a, which would be a problem unless b = a, but they are distinct elements. So in this case, (a*b)*b = b, and a*(b*b) = a. Since b ≠ a, associativity fails. So this works. \n\nTherefore, this structure satisfies all the required axioms except associativity. So this example shows that G1 is independent of G2, G3, G4. \n\nThus, the answer is to construct such a set with the operation defined as above. The key assumptions are commutativity, existence of identity and inverses, and the lack of associativity.",
