    "Content": "I have seen many people say that a and b can't be positive for example in this false proof : $$1=\\sqrt{1}=\\sqrt{(-1)(-1)}=\\sqrt{-1} \\sqrt{-1} = i^2 = -1$$ Trust me, I understand that $1\\neq -1$ and also by seeing this, I believe and accept that a and b should be positive or greater than 0 (for  $\\sqrt{ab}=\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}$) But I'm interested to know why is that, which is something I don't know? What is the proof ? Thanks a lot.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $a$ is a complex number and you write $\\sqrt{a}$ to denote a specific number, you have introduced a problem, as there are two complex numbeers whose square is $a$. The problem shows up when you need to choose one of the two alternatives for all complex numbers at the same time, and this is unavoidable in some situations. For example, notice that for a statement such as for all complex numbers $a$ and $b$ we have $\\sqrt a\\sqrt b=\\sqrt{ab}$ to mean anything, we need to give sense to $\\sqrt{a}$ for all $a$s. A good choice for $\\sqrt{-1}$ is certainly $i$. A good choice for $\\sqrt{1}$ is $1$, of course. Now $\\sqrt{-1}\\cdot\\sqrt{-1}$ is, according to these choices, equal to $i\\cdot i$ which is $-1$. On the other hand $\\sqrt{(-1)(-1)}$ is $\\sqrt{1}$ and we chose that to be $1$; we have a problem. Ok. Maybe we should have chosen $\\sqrt{1}$ to be $-1$? Let's see what happens. Now $\\sqrt{1}\\cdot\\sqrt{1}$ is $(-1)\\cdot(-1)$, which is $1$, and $\\sqrt{1\\cdot1}=\\sqrt{1}=-1$: oh no! And you can go on like this... Indeed, theere are four choices in all for what $\\sqrt{1}$ and $\\sqrt{-1}$ can mean: | sqrt{1} sqrt{-1}\n|   1       i      \n|   1      -i     \n|  -1       i     \n|  -1      -i In each of these four options you can reach a problem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the user's guidelines. The original question is about why the property √(ab) = √a√b only holds when a and b are non-negative. The user provided an example with a false proof using -1 to show the contradiction. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The key points here are the conditions under which the square root property is valid. The main assumption is that a and b must be positive. But wait, the user says \"positive or greater than 0,\" which is the same thing. So the assumption should be that a and b are non-negative. However, the original false proof uses a and b as negative numbers (-1 each), leading to a contradiction. The problem is asking for the proof that the property only holds when a and b are positive.\n\nWait, but in mathematics, the square root of a product equals the product of the square roots only when both a and b are non-negative. If either is negative, it might not hold because of the properties of complex numbers. So the assumptions should state that a and b are non-negative. The problem is to prove why the equality √(ab) = √a√b is valid only under those conditions.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, the formatted problem lists each assumption line by line. Here, the key assumption is that a and b are non-negative. But the user's example in the problem didn't split into multiple lines unless there were multiple separate conditions. Since here the condition is that both a and b are positive (or non-negative), but the problem is to show that the equality holds only when they are positive. So maybe the assumption here is that a and b are positive, and the problem is to prove the equality under that condition, but the original question is more about why the property fails when they are negative. Hmm, perhaps the problem statement is slightly different.\n\nWait, the user's original question is asking for the proof that the property √(ab) = √a√b is only valid when a and b are positive. So the problem is to prove that the equality holds if and only if a and b are non-negative. But in the example given by the user, they structured the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\" with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem is to prove the statement under the given assumptions.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove why the equality √(ab) = √a√b is valid only when a and b are positive. So the assumptions here would be the conditions required for the equality to hold, which is that a and b are non-negative real numbers. However, the original question is phrased as \"why is that the case\" when a and b are not positive. So perhaps the assumptions here are not part of the problem but rather the conditions under which the property holds. Wait, the user wants the assumptions listed as part of the problem structure.\n\nLooking back at the example: the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove that the equality √(ab)=√a√b is only valid when a and b are positive. So the assumptions here would be the conditions under which the equality holds. But the user is asking for the proof of why the equality is only valid under those conditions. Therefore, the problem is to show that the equality holds if and only if a and b are non-negative. However, in the example, the assumptions are the given conditions (n is integer, divisible by 7), and the problem is to prove the divisibility. Here, perhaps the assumptions are that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove the equality. But the original question is more about why the equality fails when a or b are negative, so maybe the problem is to show that the equality √(ab)=√a√b requires a and b to be non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are part of the problem's context. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format. Assumption: All the assumptions... applied to one object. Problem: The problem.\"\n\nIn the original question, the user is pointing out that when a and b are negative, the equality fails. So the problem is to prove why the equality √(ab)=√a√b is valid only when a and b are positive. The assumptions here would be the necessary conditions for the equality to hold, which are that a and b are non-negative. However, the question is to prove that the equality holds only under those conditions. So the assumptions might not be part of the problem's given conditions but rather the conditions that need to be established. But according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 given that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the assumptions would be that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove that √(ab)=√a√b. But the original question is phrased as why the equality is only valid when a and b are positive, so the problem is to prove that the equality holds if and only if a and b are non-negative. Therefore, the assumptions might not be listed here because the problem is to establish the conditions under which the equality holds. However, the example includes assumptions given in the problem. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that are taken for granted in the problem. For example, in the original false proof, the assumption that √((-1)(-1)) = √(-1)√(-1) leads to a contradiction, hence the need to state that a and b must be positive. So the problem here is to prove that the equality √(ab)=√a√b holds only when a and b are non-negative. Therefore, the assumption here is that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove the equality. But the user is asking for why the equality is only valid under those conditions, which implies that the problem is to show that if the equality holds, then a and b must be non-negative. Or perhaps the problem is to prove both directions: the equality holds if and only if a and b are non-negative.\n\nGiven the example provided, the formatted problem lists assumptions that are given (n is integer, divisible by 7), then the problem is to prove something. In this current case, perhaps the problem is structured with assumptions that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b. But the original question is more about why the equality fails when they are negative, which suggests that the problem is to show that the equality does not hold when a or b are negative. However, the user's example seems to structure the problem as proving a statement under certain assumptions. Therefore, perhaps here the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b given that a and b are non-negative, which is the standard property. But the original question is asking why this is only valid when they are positive, so maybe the problem should be to prove that the equality holds if a and b are non-negative, and that it may fail otherwise. But the user's example only states the problem as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\" under certain assumptions. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions would be that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b. However, the original question is more about understanding why the restriction is necessary, so perhaps the problem is to prove that the equality √(ab) = √a√b holds if and only if a and b are non-negative. But the example didn't use \"if and only if\", just a direct statement under assumptions. Maybe I should stick to the exact wording of the original question. The user's question is \"Can someone prove why √(ab)=√a√b is only valid when a and b are positive?\" So the problem is to prove that the equality holds only when a and b are positive. Hence, the assumptions are that a and b are positive, and the problem is to prove the equality. But the user is asking for the reasoning behind the necessity of the positivity condition. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLooking back at the user's example: the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem statement was then to prove the divisibility. In the current case, the problem is to prove why the equality holds only when a and b are positive. So perhaps the assumptions here are that a and b are positive, and the problem is to prove the equality. However, the user already knows that when a and b are negative, the equality fails, so the problem is more about proving the necessity of the condition. Therefore, maybe the problem should be structured as proving that if a and b are non-negative, then √(ab) = √a√b, and if either a or b is negative, the equality may not hold. But the example provided by the user has a straightforward problem statement under certain assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove the equivalence: √(ab) = √a√b if and only if a and b are non-negative. But how to structure that? The example didn't use an equivalence, just a direct implication under assumptions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to follow the structure of the example. The example lists the assumptions (conditions that must hold) and then the problem to prove. Here, the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b, but this equality is only valid under certain conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would be those conditions, i.e., a and b are non-negative. The problem is to prove the equality under those assumptions. However, the original question is phrased as why the equality is only valid when a and b are positive, which is slightly different. The user wants the proof that the equality requires a and b to be non-negative. Therefore, the problem might need to be phrased as proving that the equality √(ab) = √a√b holds if and only if a and b are non-negative. But the example didn't use \"if and only if\", so maybe it's better to split into two parts: one direction under assumptions, and the converse. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which is one-directional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are that a and b are positive, and the problem is to prove the equality, which is the standard property. The user's question is why this is necessary, so the problem is to prove that the equality holds when a and b are positive, and explain why it fails otherwise. But the format requires listing assumptions and the problem. Since the user's example includes assumptions that are given (n is integer, divisible by 7), here the assumptions would be a and b are positive, and the problem is to prove the equality. However, the original question is asking for the proof that the equality is only valid under those conditions, which is slightly different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are not listed here because the problem is to establish the conditions, but the example requires listing assumptions. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as the conditions under which the equality holds (a and b are non-negative), and the problem is to prove the equality. The user's original question is asking for why the equality is only valid under those conditions, so the answer would involve proving the equality under the assumptions and showing counterexamples when the assumptions are violated. However, according to the formatting instructions, the task is to structure the problem as per the example, which lists assumptions and then the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b. \n\nBut in the user's example, the assumptions included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the key assumption is that a and b are non-negative. Since non-negativity is a single condition applied to both a and b, but the example splits into two lines even for different conditions on the same object. Wait, in the example, the two assumptions are both on n: n is integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition on the same object. In this case, the problem here has two separate conditions on a and b: each must be non-negative. However, in the original problem, the user says \"a and b are positive\", which is a single condition applied to both. But the example splits into two separate lines for different conditions. So maybe here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- a is non-negative,\n- b is non-negative.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that √(ab) = √a√b.\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as why this equality is only valid when a and b are positive. Therefore, the problem is to prove that if a and b are non-negative, then √(ab) = √a√b, and if either a or b is negative, the equality may not hold. However, the formatting example only includes the positive direction (under assumptions, prove the statement). Therefore, following the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions (a and b non-negative) and the problem is to prove the equality. The user's question includes the reverse direction (why it's only valid when...), but the format doesn't include that. Hence, perhaps the answer should be structured with the assumptions that a and b are non-negative, and the problem is to prove the equality. The necessity of the conditions (i.e., why they can't be negative) would be part of the proof, but the formatted problem as per the example only requires the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is non-negative,\nb is non-negative.\nProblem:\nProve that √(ab) = √a√b.\n\nBut the original question is about why the equality is only valid when a and b are positive. However, in mathematics, the square root property holds for non-negative real numbers, not necessarily positive. So maybe \"non-negative\" is more accurate than \"positive\". The user's example used \"positive or greater than 0\", which is redundant since positive already means greater than 0. Perhaps the user intended non-negative (including zero). The false proof uses a and b as -1, which are negative. Therefore, the correct assumption is that a and b are non-negative. Hence, the formatted problem would list a and b as non-negative and the problem to prove the equality. The necessity part (why they must be non-negative) would be addressed in the proof by showing that if either is negative, the equality fails.",
