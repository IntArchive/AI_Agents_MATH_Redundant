    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and then extract the assumptions and the problem statement as per the example provided.\n\nThe original problem is about proving a specific integral result that Cleo posted. The integral in question is the integral from 0 to infinity of the fourth power of the exponential integral function Ei(-x). The result is expressed in terms of various logarithmic terms and polylogarithms. The user mentions that the result has been numerically verified with high precision but lacks a proof. The task is to prove this result.\n\nNow, following the example given, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is [Ei(-x)]^4. The exponential integral Ei(x) is defined here as the negative integral from -x to infinity of e^{-t}/t dt. However, since the argument is -x, the function becomes Ei(-x) = -∫_{x}^infty e^{-t}/t dt. Wait, no, let me check the definition again. The original definition given is Ei(x) = -∫_{-x}^infty e^{-t}/t dt. So substituting -x into Ei, we get Ei(-x) = -∫_{x}^infty e^{-t}/t dt. That might be important.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the integral of [Ei(-x)]^4 from 0 to infinity equals that combination of polylogarithms, zeta functions, and logarithmic terms. The assumptions here would be related to the properties of the Ei function, the limits of integration, and any conditions on x or other variables. However, in the problem statement, there's no explicit restriction mentioned except that the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is Ei(-x) raised to the fourth power. The original answer by Cleo states the result without proof, and the question is asking for a proof.\n\nNow, looking at the example given, the assumptions listed were about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. In this case, are there any assumptions stated in the problem? The problem doesn't mention any specific conditions; it's just an integral over a positive real line. The function Ei(-x) is defined for real x, and since the integral is from 0 to infinity, perhaps the assumption is that x is a positive real number. Also, the definition of Ei is given, so maybe that's part of the problem setup. But in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables in the problem. Here, the integral is definite, so maybe the main assumption is about the domain of integration and the function's definition.\n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n- The function Ei is defined as Ei(x) = -∫_{-x}^infty e^{-t}/t dt.\n- The integral is taken from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is [Ei(-x)]^4.\n\nWait, but the problem already states the integral from 0 to infinity and the definition of Ei. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem statement. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, that example might have had a typo or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe original problem in the example says: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists the assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not necessarily divisible by 7. So that seems incorrect. Maybe the user made an error in the example. But I should follow the user's instructions regardless. So in their example, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. The user says \"filtered the unrelated information\" and structure the problem with assumptions. Wait, perhaps the example had a different original problem where n was required to be divisible by 7, but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\". Hmm, perhaps there was a mistake. But regardless, I need to follow the instructions.\n\nIn this current problem, the key elements are the definition of Ei, the integral bounds, and the integrand. The problem is to prove the equality of the integral to the given expression. The assumptions would be the definitions and conditions necessary for the integral to make sense. For example, that Ei is defined as given, that the integral is over x from 0 to infinity, and that the integrand is the fourth power of Ei(-x). Also, perhaps that the integral converges, but that might be part of the problem rather than an assumption. Alternatively, the problem may assume that the integral exists and the task is to compute it.\n\nBut in the problem statement, there's no explicit assumption given other than the definition of Ei and the integral. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- The exponential integral function is defined as Ei(x) = -∫_{-x}^infty (e^{-t}/t) dt.\n- The integral is evaluated over x from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is the fourth power of Ei(-x).\n\nBut in the example, they listed assumptions about the variable n. Here, the variable x is integrated out, so perhaps there are no variables left, unless there's a parameter. Wait, the problem is a definite integral, resulting in a constant expression. So maybe the assumptions are about the function and the integral's limits. Therefore, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable in the expression. Here, since it's an integral with no variables left after integration, perhaps the assumptions are about the function and the integral's setup.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The exponential integral function is defined as $\\operatorname{Ei}(x) = -\\int_{-x}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$.\n- The integral is taken from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n- The integrand is the fourth power of $\\operatorname{Ei}(-x)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\operatorname{Ei}^4(-x)\\,dx &= 24\\operatorname{Li}_3\\!\\left(\\tfrac14\\right) -48\\operatorname{Li}_2\\!\\left(\\tfrac13\\right)\\ln2 -13\\,\\zeta(3) \\\\\n&\\quad -32\\ln^32 +48\\ln^22\\cdot\\ln3 -24\\ln2\\cdot\\ln^23 +6\\pi^2\\ln2.\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions were about the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), but in this problem, there's no variable; it's a definite integral. So maybe the assumptions here are about the definitions and the integral setup. But the user's example might have had a mistake where they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. However, I need to follow the format as per the user's instruction.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the problem assumes that the integral converges, but that's usually part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps there are hidden conditions, like x being positive, which is implied by the integral from 0 to infinity. So x is a positive real number.\n\nThus, possible assumptions:\n\n- $x$ is a positive real number.\n- The exponential integral function $\\operatorname{Ei}(x)$ is defined as $-\\int_{-x}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$.\n- The integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\operatorname{Ei}^4(-x)\\,dx$ is considered.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem statement, since it's definite, the main assumptions are the definition of Ei and the integral's domain. So I think the correct assumptions here are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The exponential integral function is defined as $\\operatorname{Ei}(x) = -\\int_{-x}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$.\n- The integral is computed over the interval $[0, \\infty)$.\n- The integrand is the fourth power of $\\operatorname{Ei}(-x)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals the given combination of polylogarithms, zeta function, and logarithmic terms.\n\nBut the problem statement already includes all these elements. However, the example included an assumption that wasn't explicit in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake. Let me recheck the example.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which would not require n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made an error in their example. Therefore, I should not take the example's assumptions as necessarily correct but follow the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key components are the definition of Ei, the domain of integration, and the integrand being the fourth power. Since the problem is to evaluate the integral, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function $\\operatorname{Ei}(x)$ is defined as $-\\int_{-x}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$.\n- The integral is taken over $x$ from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n- The integrand is $[\\operatorname{Ei}(-x)]^4$.\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n$\\operatorname{Ei}(x)$ is defined as $-\\int_{-x}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} dt$,\nThe integral is evaluated over $x \\in [0, \\infty)$,\nThe integrand is $\\operatorname{Ei}^4(-x)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\begin{align}\\int_0^\\infty\\operatorname{Ei}^4(-x)\\,dx&=24\\operatorname{Li}_3\\!\\left(\\tfrac14\\right)-48\\operatorname{Li}_2\\!\\left(\\tfrac13\\right)\\ln2-13\\,\\zeta(3)\\\\&-32\\ln^32+48\\ln^22\\cdot\\ln3-24\\ln2\\cdot\\ln^23+6\\pi^2\\ln2.\\end{align}$$\n\nYes, this seems accurate. Each assumption is a single condition about one object: the definition of Ei, the domain of integration, and the integrand's form. The problem is to prove the equality.",
