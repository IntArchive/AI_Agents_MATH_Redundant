    "Content": "We have a special function $S$ from the real interval $[0, 1)$ to the real-interval $(0, 1]$ which I will define near the end of this post. Someone claims that the following proof-schema is valid: We wish to prove some statement $P(x)$ for each real number in the closed interval $[0, 1]$ . First, we show that the statement $P(0)$ is true. Next we let $x$ be an arbitrary element of the interval $[0, 1]$ . We assume that $P(x)$ is true, and then we prove that $P \\begin{pmatrix} S(x) \\end{pmatrix}$ is also be true. We conclude that $\\forall x \\in [0, 1], P(x)$ An answer to this stack-exchange question is a proof that the above proof-schema is correct or incorrect. If you think that induction on real-numbers is not valid, then an answer to this question is a proof of the existence of a predicate $P$ such that: $P(0)$ is true. $\\exists x \\in (0, 1]$ such that $P(x)$ is false. There is no real number $x$ in the interval $[0, 1)$ such that $P(x)$ is true and $P(S(x))$ is false. Equivalently, show that $\\forall x \\in [0, 1)$ if the statement $P(S(x))$ is false then the statement $P(x)$ is also false. Informal Description of function $S$ Informally,you can compute $S(x)$ by the following procedure: STEP ONE : Get a decimal-expansion of $x$ . Look only at digits to the right of the decimal point. Go from left to right until you find a digit which is not nine. For example, if $x = 0.9990123$ then the left-most digit which is not a nine is a zero. Now add one to the digit which is not a nine. After adding $1$ to the left-most-non-nine digit in $0.9990123$ we get $0.9991123$ . STEP TWO : Replace the leftmost nines with zeros. if $x = 0.9990123$ then $S(x) = 0.0001123$ Approximation of $x$ Approximation of $S(x)$ $x$ $S(x)$ $0.99531416$ $0.99631416$ $ 0.995 + \\frac{pi}{10^{-4}}$ $ x + 10^{-3}$ $0.141421356237$ $0.241421356237$ $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ $ 0.1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{10}$ $0$ $0.1$ $0$ $0.1$ $0.1$ $0.2$ $0.1$ $0.2$ $0.1$ $0.2$ $0.1$ $0.2$ $0.2$ $0.3$ $0.2$ $0.3$ $0.3$ $0.4$ $0.3$ $0.4$ $0.999991$ $0.999992$ $0.999991$ $0.999992$ $0.93$ $0.94$ $0.93$ $0.94$ $0.999999999 \\dots 0000 \\dots$ $0.000000000 \\dots 10000 \\dots$ $1- 10^{-100}$ $10^{-101}$ If $S(x) = 1$ then $x = 0.9$ If $S(x) = 0.9$ then $x = 0.8$ If $S(x) = 0.8$ then $x = 0.7$ $$\\dots$$ If $S(x) = 0.2$ then $x = 0.1$ Formal Definition of Function $S$ Let $S$ be a function from the real interval $[0, 1)$ to the real-interval $(0, 1]$ such that $\\forall x \\in [0, 1)$ , $S(x) = x  +10^{-(1 + g(x))} + 10^{-g(x)}$ . Function $g$ is defined as follows: $$\\forall x \\in [0, 1], g(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1,  & \\text{if  } \\lfloor 10* x \\rfloor \\neq 9 \\\\\n1 + g(10*x - \\lfloor 10* x \\rfloor), & \\text{ otherwise }\n\\end{cases}$$ Some Notes About Function $S$ Note 1: Irrational Inputs like $\\pi$ are Okay $S(x)$ is well-defined for irrational inputs such as $x = \\pi$ and $x = \\sqrt{2}$ Note 2: What is $\\lfloor 10* x \\rfloor \\neq 9$ ? Note that $\\lfloor 10* x \\rfloor \\neq 9$ if and only if the left-most digit is $9$ . For example, $\\frac{\\pi}{10}$ is approximately $0.31459$ , which has a $3$ as its left-most digit. So, $\\lfloor 10*\\frac{\\pi}{10} \\rfloor \\neq 9$ $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the \"floor\" function. What if the $9$ s never end? Note that the only real number in the interval $[0, 1)$ which has only nines in its decimal-expansion is the number $1$ which can be expanded as $0.999999 \\dots$ . However, $1$ is not a valid input to function $S$ . All numbers in $[0, 1]$ besides the number $1$ have at least one non-nine digit. As such, we can always find the left-most digit which is not-a-nine. A Different Informal way to Compute $S(x)$ Informally, we can: Find a decimal expansion of real number $x$ Delete the decimal point and write the digits in reverse order. For example, if $x = \\sqrt{2} ≈ 0.1414213 \\dots$ then write $\\dots 3124141$ Add one to the result from step $2$ as if the step $2$ result was a natural number (it is not actually a natural. The result is not eventually all zero as you move leftward). Re-reverse the digits. Note that the result step $2$ is NOT a natural number. The result of step $2$ is a function $F$ from $\\mathbb{N}$ to the digits $\\begin{Bmatrix} 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\end{Bmatrix}$ such that we probably have: $\\not\\exists n \\in \\mathbb{N}: \\forall m \\geq n, F(m) = 0$ For example if $x = \\frac{\\pi}{10}$ then: $F(1) = 3$ $F(2) = 1$ $F(3) = 4$ $F(4) = 1$ $F(5) = 5$ $F(6) = 9$ In general, $F(k)$ is one of the digits of the decimal expansion of $\\pi$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $P(x)$ be the predicate \" $x$ is a terminating decimal\"; that is, $x = \\frac{a}{10^n}$ for some integers $a, n$ .  Since $S$ applied to any terminating decimal is a terminating decimal, the implication $P(x) \\to P(S(x))$ holds for all $x$ .  Of course $P(0)$ is true as well.  But (for example) $P(1/3)$ is false.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So the user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the core problem. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving whether a certain proof-by-induction schema is invalid for the real interval [0,1]. The schema involves showing P(0) is true, assuming P(x) implies P(S(x)) for some function S, and then concluding P(x) holds for all x in [0,1]. The user wants to show that this induction method isn't valid by providing a predicate P that meets specific conditions.\n\nNow, I need to list all the assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the question again to extract these.\n\nFirst, the function S is defined from [0,1) to (0,1]. The problem mentions that P(0) is true, there exists an x in (0,1] where P(x) is false, and for all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false. These are the key conditions for the predicate P. The function S has its own definition involving decimal expansions, but the main assumptions related to the problem are about the properties of P and the structure of the induction schema.\n\nSo the assumptions should include the domain and codomain of S, the conditions on P (P(0) is true, existence of x where P(x) is false, and the implication relating P(x) and P(S(x))). Also, note that the problem wants to show the existence of such a P, which would invalidate the induction schema.\n\nWait, the problem says: if you think induction on reals is invalid, then show there exists a predicate P such that P(0) is true, there's some x in (0,1] where P(x) is false, and for all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false then P(x) is false. So these are the conditions that P must satisfy. Therefore, these should be the assumptions for the problem.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the properties of P and the function S. However, the problem is to prove the existence of such a P, so maybe the assumptions are the given conditions that must be met by P and S. Let me parse this.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists a predicate P meeting three conditions:\n\n1. P(0) is true.\n2. There exists x in (0,1] where P(x) is false.\n3. For all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nSo these three points are the conditions that the predicate P must satisfy. Therefore, these should be the assumptions listed. Additionally, the function S is defined with certain properties, but since the problem is about the schema using S, the definition of S is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions included properties of n. Here, maybe the function S's definition is part of the problem's given, not an assumption. The problem is structured as: given this function S and this induction schema, show that there exists a predicate P meeting these conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions on P and S.\n\nWait, the problem says \"show that the above proof-schema is correct or incorrect. If you think that induction on real-numbers is not valid, then an answer to this question is a proof of the existence of a predicate P such that: P(0) is true. ∃x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false. There is no real number x in the interval [0,1) such that P(x) is true and P(S(x)) is false. Equivalently, show that ∀x ∈ [0,1), if the statement P(S(x)) is false then the statement P(x) is also false.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove the existence of such a predicate P. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] as defined.\n- We need to find a predicate P such that:\n  1. P(0) is true.\n  2. ∃x ∈ (0,1], P(x) is false.\n  3. ∀x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nBut the user's example lists assumptions as properties of the objects in the problem. Here, the main assumptions for the problem would be the conditions that P must satisfy. However, the function S is part of the problem setup, so maybe it's included as an assumption.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions the function S is defined in a certain way, so perhaps we need to include that as an assumption? For example, \"S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by [description]\".\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction didn't include the definition of A(n) in the assumptions, only the conditions on n. Here, maybe the definition of S is part of the problem's setup and doesn't need to be listed as an assumption. The assumptions are the conditions that need to be satisfied by P and the structure of the induction schema.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the validity of the induction schema using S, the properties of S might be considered assumptions. However, the problem states the function S is defined as part of the problem, so perhaps the key assumptions are about P. Let me re-express this.\n\nThe problem is to show there exists a predicate P where:\n\n1. P(0) holds.\n2. Some x in (0,1] has P(x) false.\n3. For all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would be these three conditions on P. However, the problem is to prove the existence of such a P, so perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions (i.e., the problem is under the assumptions that S is defined as such and we need to find P meeting 1-3).\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] as defined.\n- The induction schema requires proving P(0) and that P(x) implies P(S(x)).\n\nBut the problem is to show that this schema is invalid by exhibiting a P where the base case and inductive step hold, but the conclusion fails. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions on P and the properties of S, but in the problem statement, we need to structure the problem as listing the assumptions and then the problem.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be about the properties of P and the function S. But the problem is to show the existence of P with those properties, so the assumptions might include the definition of S and the structure of the induction schema.\n\nHowever, the user's format says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo I need to break down each assumption into separate lines. Let's see:\n\n1. The function S maps [0,1) to (0,1].\n2. The predicate P satisfies P(0) is true.\n3. There exists an x in (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n4. For all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nBut the function S has its own definition, which might be considered part of the problem's setup. However, since the problem mentions S is defined in a certain way, perhaps the definition of S is an assumption.\n\nWait, the problem says \"We have a special function S from [0,1) to (0,1] which I will define near the end of this post.\" Then they give an informal and formal definition. So the definition of S is part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would include the definition of S.\n\nBut how to break that down? For example:\n\n- S: [0,1) → (0,1] is defined by [steps].\n- For x ∈ [0,1), S(x) = x + 10^{-(1 + g(x))} + 10^{-g(x)}, where g(x) is defined recursively based on decimal digits.\n\nBut the user's example didn't include the full definition of A(n) in the assumptions, only the conditions on n. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the properties related to the induction schema and P, while the definition of S is part of the problem's context but not listed as separate assumptions unless they are critical.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the schema using S, the definition of S is critical. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the expression for A(n) was part of the problem statement. Similarly, here, the function S is part of the problem's setup, so maybe it's not listed as an assumption but is part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. The function A(n) was part of the problem's expression. Similarly, here, the function S is part of the problem's definition, so maybe the assumptions are the conditions on P and the induction schema.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information. The original question has a lot of details about S, but the key points are:\n\n- The induction schema: prove P(0), assume P(x) and prove P(S(x)), conclude ∀x P(x).\n- The task is to show this schema is invalid by finding a P where P(0) is true, some x in (0,1] has P(x) false, and for all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false then P(x) is false.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the conditions that P must satisfy, and the function S is part of the problem's context. However, to structure it properly, maybe the assumptions include the properties of S that are necessary for the problem.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are about the objects involved. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1].\n- P(0) is true.\n- ∃x ∈ (0,1], P(x) is false.\n- ∀x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nWait, but the problem is to show the existence of such a P. So actually, the problem is to prove that there exists a predicate P satisfying those three conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are the given conditions (i.e., the properties that P must satisfy and the definition of S). But in the user's example, the assumptions were the conditions on n (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions would be the properties that the problem requires for P and S.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the user wants the assumptions to be the given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is to prove the existence of P with those three properties, then the assumptions are those properties plus the definition of S.\n\nBut the definition of S is quite detailed. To follow the example, perhaps the assumptions are listed as:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by the given procedure.\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x in (0,1] where P(x) is false.\n- For all x in [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nBut since the problem is to show the existence of such a P, the actual assumptions are that S is defined as such, and the problem is to construct P meeting the other three conditions. However, in the user's example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the variables are P and S, but S is given. So the assumptions would be the conditions that P must satisfy, and the properties of S as defined.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1].\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), S(x) is defined by the given procedure (incrementing the first non-nine digit and replacing preceding nines with zeros).\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nBut the problem is to show that such a P exists, which would demonstrate the invalidity of the induction schema. Therefore, the problem statement is to prove the existence of a predicate P satisfying those three conditions with the given function S.\n\nHowever, the user's example formatted the problem as:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nHere, similarly, the assumptions are the conditions on n, and the problem is to prove something about A(n).\n\nIn this case, the assumptions would be the conditions on P and the properties of S. But the problem is to show the existence of P with those properties. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions that must be satisfied (i.e., the three conditions on P and the definition of S), and the problem is to construct such a P.\n\nBut the original question says: \"show that the above proof-schema is correct or incorrect. If you think that induction on real-numbers is not valid, then an answer to this question is a proof of the existence of a predicate P such that: P(0) is true. ∃x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false. There is no real number x in the interval [0,1) such that P(x) is true and P(S(x)) is false. Equivalently, show that ∀x ∈ [0,1), if the statement P(S(x)) is false then the statement P(x) is also false.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove the existence of such a predicate P. Hence, the assumptions are the given conditions (the definition of S and the induction schema), and the problem is to show there's a P meeting the three conditions.\n\nBut how to structure this into the format? The user's example had assumptions about the variable in the problem (n). Here, perhaps the assumptions are about P and S:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by incrementing the first non-nine digit.\n- The induction schema requires proving P(0) and P(x) → P(S(x)).\n- There exists a predicate P such that:\n  1. P(0) is true.\n  2. ∃x ∈ (0,1], P(x) is false.\n  3. ∀x ∈ [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nBut the problem is to prove the existence of such a P. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions that P must meet and the properties of S. However, in the user's example, the assumptions were the conditions on n (the variable), not on the predicate. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the properties of S and the induction schema, and the problem is to find P meeting the conditions.\n\nBut the user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from the interval [0,1) to (0,1].\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), S(x) is computed by incrementing the first non-nine digit in x's decimal expansion and replacing preceding nines with zeros.\n- P is a predicate on [0,1].\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nProblem: Prove the existence of such a predicate P.\n\nBut the original problem is to show that the induction schema is invalid by demonstrating such a P exists. Therefore, the problem statement would be: \"Prove that there exists a predicate P on [0,1] such that...\" followed by the three conditions.\n\nHowever, in the user's example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove the existence of P with certain properties given the function S.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should list the assumptions related to S and the conditions on P, then state the problem as proving the existence of P.\n\nBut the function S's detailed definition might be part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The user's example didn't include the formula for A(n) in the assumptions but in the problem statement. Similarly, here, the definition of S is part of the problem's context.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1].\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a P exists. Wait, but the problem is to show that the induction schema is invalid by providing such a P. So the assumptions are the properties that P must satisfy, and the problem is to prove their existence.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n), not about the predicate. Here, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the induction schema and S, and the problem is to show the existence of a counterexample P.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look back at the user's instructions: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nThe original question has a lot of details about function S, but the key points are:\n\n- The induction schema: prove P(0), and for any x, P(x) implies P(S(x)), then conclude ∀x P(x).\n- The task is to show this schema is invalid by finding a P where P(0) is true, some x in (0,1] has P(x) false, and for all x in [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The induction schema uses the function S as defined.\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists x ∈ (0,1] where P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nBut the problem is to prove that such a P exists. Therefore, the formatted problem would list these as the assumptions (conditions that P must meet) and the problem is to prove their existence.\n\nWait, but in the user's example, the assumptions were the conditions on n (the variable), and the problem was to prove something about A(n). Here, the assumptions are the conditions on P and S, and the problem is to show that such a P exists.\n\nBut perhaps the function S's definition is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. For example, in the user's example, the problem statement included the expression for A(n). Similarly, here, the problem statement would mention the function S and the induction schema, and the assumptions would be the conditions on P.\n\nBut the user's format requires listing assumptions line by line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by incrementing the first non-nine digit in the decimal expansion.\n- P is a predicate on [0,1].\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a predicate P exists.\n\nBut the problem is already to prove the existence, so maybe the assumptions are the given conditions (the properties that P must satisfy and the definition of S), and the problem is to construct P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stated as:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a predicate P on [0,1] such that:\n1. P(0) is true.\n2. ∃x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n3. ∀x ∈ [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nIn this case, the assumptions would include the definition of S, since it's part of the problem's setup.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are separate from the problem statement. The example's problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" with assumptions about n.\n\nSo applying that here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by the given procedure.\n- The induction schema uses S to prove ∀x ∈ [0,1], P(x) by proving P(0) and P(x) → P(S(x)).\n\nAnd the problem is to show the existence of a predicate P meeting the three conditions.\n\nBut the user's format requires each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1].\n- For any x ∈ [0,1), S(x) is computed by incrementing the first non-nine digit in x's decimal expansion and replacing preceding nines with zeros.\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a predicate P exists.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are the conditions that P must satisfy, but in this case, the problem is to find P meeting those conditions. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are the definition of S and the structure of the induction schema, and the problem is to show the existence of P that violates the conclusion despite satisfying the base and inductive steps.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions as properties of the variable in the problem (n), not of the predicate. Here, the variable is P and the structure involves S. This is a bit different, but following the user's instructions, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1] defined by the given procedure.\n- The induction schema involves proving P(0) and ∀x ∈ [0,1), P(x) → P(S(x))).\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that there exists a predicate P such that P(0) is true, ∃x ∈ (0,1] with P(x) false, and ∀x ∈ [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line. Let's try:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a function from [0,1) to (0,1].\n- For each x ∈ [0,1), S(x) is computed by incrementing the first non-nine digit in x's decimal expansion.\n- P is a predicate defined on [0,1].\n- P(0) is true.\n- There exists an x ∈ (0,1] such that P(x) is false.\n- For all x ∈ [0,1), if P(S(x)) is false, then P(x) is false.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a predicate P exists.\n\nBut the problem is to show the existence, which is the actual task. So the assumptions are the conditions that P must satisfy, and the problem is to prove that such a P exists.\n\nHowever, in the user's example, the assumptions were about the variables (n's properties), and the problem was to prove a property about A(n). Here, the assumptions are about P and S, and the problem is to prove the existence of P.\n\nBut the user's example didn't have the existence as part of the problem statement; it was to prove a divisibility. Here, the problem is to prove existence, so perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that must be met (the three bullet points for P), and the problem is to show that such a P exists.\n\nHowever, the function S's definition is critical to the problem, so it must be included as an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- S: [0,1) → (0,1] is defined by incrementing the first non-nine digit in x's decimal expansion and replacing preceding nines with zeros.\n- P(0) is true.\n- ∃x ∈ (0,1], P(x) is false.\n- ∀x ∈ [0,1), ¬P(S(x)) → ¬P(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that such a predicate P exists.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the existence, so the assumptions are the conditions that P must satisfy, and the function S's definition. This seems to fit the format.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should structure the problem by listing the assumptions about S and the conditions on P, then state the problem as proving the existence of such a P.",
