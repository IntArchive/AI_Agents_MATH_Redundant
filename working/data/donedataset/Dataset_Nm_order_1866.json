    "Content": "For every unit vector $x$ in a Hilbert space $H$,let $F_x$ be the linear functional on $\\mathcal B(H)$ (bounded linear operators) defined by $F_x(T)=(Tx,x)$. Prove that each $F_x$ is pure state and $\\mathcal B(H)$ has pure states which are not like this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider an orthonormal basis $\\{x_j\\}$ of $H$ with $x_1=x$, and consider $\\{E_{kj}\\}$ the corresponding matrix units (we don't really need matrix units, just the projection onto the span of $x$, but it might help understand). Assume that you can write $F_x=\\alpha f + (1-\\alpha)g$, for some $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ and states $f,g$. Then, since $0\\leq E_{11}\\leq I$,\n$$\n1=\\langle E_{11}x,x\\rangle = F_x(E_{11})=\\alpha f(E_{11}) + (1-\\alpha) g(E_{11})\\leq\n\\alpha+1-\\alpha = 1.\n$$\nSo $\\alpha f(E_{11}) + (1-\\alpha) g(E_{11})=1$. But as $f(E_{11})\\leq1$, $g(E_{11})\\leq1$, we conclude that $f(E_{11})=g(E_{11})=1$. In particular, $f(I-E_{11})=0$. Then, for any $T\\in B(H)$,\n$$\n0\\leq|f(T(I-E_{11}))|\\leq f(T^*T)^{1/2} f((I-E_{11})^2)^{1/2}=f(T^*T)^{1/2}f(I-E_{11})^{1/2}=0.\n$$\nThus $f(T)=f(T\\,E_{11})$ for all $T$. Taking adjoints, $f(T)=f(E_{11}T)$. But then $f(T)=f(TE_{11})=f(E_{11}TE_{11})$. As $E_{11}TE_{11}=\\langle Tx,x\\rangle\\,E_{11}=F_x(T)E_{11}$,\n$$\nf(T)=f(E_{11}TE_{11})=F_x(T)\\,f(E_{11})=F_x(T).\n$$\nSimilarly with $g$, so $F_x$ is an extreme point. Edit: thanks to Matthew for noting that my argument in the last paragraph from the previous version was wrong. Here is the new argument. Let $\\pi_0:B(H)\\to B(H)/K(H)$ be the quotient map onto the Calkin algebra $C(H)$. Let $\\pi_1:C(H)\\to B(K)$ be an irreducible representation of $C(H)$. Then \n$$\n\\pi=\\pi_1\\circ\\pi_0:B(H)\\to B(K)\n$$\nis an irreducible representation. Using the correspondence between irreps and pure states, there exists a pure state $\\varphi$ on $B(H)$ such that its GNS representation is unitarily equivalent to $\\pi$. But this tells us that $\\varphi(T)=0$ for all $T\\in K(H)$, and so $\\varphi$ cannot be a point state.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that certain functionals are pure states on the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space and that there are other pure states not of that form.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions \"For every unit vector x in a Hilbert space H\". So that's one assumption: x is a unit vector in H. Then F_x is defined as a linear functional on B(H), the bounded linear operators, by F_x(T) = (Tx, x). The problem then asks to prove two things: each F_x is a pure state, and B(H) has pure states not of this form. \n\nWait, the assumptions here are about the objects involved. The Hilbert space H, the unit vector x in H, and the definition of F_x. But the problem itself is to prove two statements. The user's example had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, the first assumption is that H is a Hilbert space. Then x is a unit vector in H. Then F_x is defined as the functional on B(H) by F_x(T) = (Tx, x). \n\nBut the problem is to prove two things: each F_x is a pure state, and there exist pure states on B(H) that aren't of the form F_x. The user's format requires the problem statement to be concise. So the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the actual task.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7; that seems like an error. Wait, the example says the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because 91 is 7*13, perhaps the original problem had n such that 5^n +1 etc., but maybe the user added an assumption? Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n\n- x is a unit vector in H.\n\n- F_x is a linear functional on B(H) defined by F_x(T) = (Tx, x).\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"for every unit vector x\", so x is any unit vector, so maybe the assumptions should list that H is a Hilbert space, x is a unit vector in H, and F_x is defined as that functional. Then the problem is to prove that each F_x is a pure state and that there exist pure states not of this form.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So H being a Hilbert space is one assumption. x being a unit vector in H is another. F_x being defined as that functional is another. Then the problem is the two parts: prove F_x is pure, and existence of others.\n\nBut perhaps the definition of a pure state is part of the problem? Wait, in the original question, the user is supposed to know what a pure state is. The problem doesn't define it, so maybe it's assumed knowledge. Therefore, the assumptions don't need to include definitions from the context. So the key assumptions here are H is a Hilbert space, x is a unit vector in H, and F_x is the functional defined as (Tx, x). Then the problem is to prove those two things.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nx is a unit vector in H,\nF_x is a linear functional on B(H) defined by F_x(T) = (Tx, x).\nProblem:\nProve that each F_x is a pure state and B(H) has pure states which are not of this form.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the original question says \"Prove that each F_x is pure state and B(H) has pure states which are not like this.\" So the user's example didn't include the definitions in the assumptions, but just the given conditions. So maybe \"F_x is the linear functional...\" is part of the problem statement? Let me check the original question.\n\nOriginal question: \"For every unit vector x in a Hilbert space H, let F_x be the linear functional on B(H) ... Prove that each F_x is pure state and B(H) has pure states which are not like this.\"\n\nSo the original question defines F_x given x is a unit vector. So the assumptions are H is a Hilbert space, x is a unit vector in H, and F_x is defined as that functional. Then the problem is to prove the two statements.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nx is a unit vector in H,\nF_x is the linear functional on B(H) defined by F_x(T) = (Tx, x).\nProblem:\nProve that each F_x is a pure state and B(H) has pure states which are not of this form.\n\nBut wait, in the user's example, they listed two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the example didn't have n divisible by 7. So maybe there was a mistake there. But regardless, the user wants each assumption to be one line, one property per object.\n\nIn this case, H is a Hilbert space (assumption about H), x is a unit vector in H (assumption about x), and F_x is defined as that functional (assumption about F_x). Then problem is as stated.\n\nSo the answer should be structured accordingly.",
