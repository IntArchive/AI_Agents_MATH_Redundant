    "Content": "Let $n \\in ℕ$. Show that the ring $ℤ/nℤ$ is a field if and only if $n$\n  is prime. Let $n$ prime. I need to show that if $\\bar{a} \\neq 0$ then $∃\\bar b: \\bar{a} \\cdot \\bar{b} = \\bar{1}$. Any hints for this ? Suppose $ℤ/nℤ$ is a field. Therefore: for every $\\bar{a} \\neq 0$ $∃\\bar b: \\bar{a}\\cdot \\bar{b}=1$. How can I show that $n$ must be prime ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $n$ is prime and $\\overline a\\ne0$ so $a$ isn't a multiple of $n$ and then $a$ and $n$ are coprime so by the Bezout theorem there's $b,c\\in\\mathbb Z$ such that\n$$ba+cn=1$$\nhence by passing to the class we find $\\overline a\\overline b=\\overline1$. Conversely if $n$ isn't prime then we write $n=ab$ so $\\overline0=\\overline a\\overline b$ where $\\overline a\\neq \\overline0 $ and $\\overline b\\neq 0$ hence $\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$ isn't an integral domain and then it isn't a field.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let's read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user's title is \"The ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\" Then the question elaborates: Let n ∈ ℕ. Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime. For the forward direction (n prime), they need to show that if ā ≠ 0, then there exists a b̄ such that ā·b̄ = 1̄. For the converse, assuming ℤ/nℤ is a field (every non-zero ā has an inverse), they need to show n must be prime.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem.\n\n1. The ring in question is ℤ/nℤ. So, assumption: The ring is ℤ/nℤ.\n2. The problem is to show this ring is a field if and only if n is prime. So, two directions: if n is prime, then the ring is a field; and if the ring is a field, then n is prime.\n3. The user mentions n ∈ ℕ. So, assumption: n is a natural number.\n4. In the forward direction (n prime), they need to prove every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, for the forward direction, assumption: n is a prime number.\n5. For the converse, assumption: ℤ/nℤ is a field (so every non-zero element has an inverse), and need to show n is prime.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking to show the equivalence. So the problem is: Show that ℤ/nℤ is a field ⇨ n is prime. So the problem statement as a whole is an equivalence.\n\nBut how to structure the assumptions here? The problem is to prove an equivalence, so the assumptions would be the conditions given in each direction.\n\nBut according to the example, the Assumption section lists all the assumptions of the problem, each as a single line. The example had two assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is to show an equivalence. So in the problem statement, it's \"Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring considered is ℤ/nℤ.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the problem is to show an equivalence, so both directions. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more general. Let me check the original example again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is n is integer, n divisible by 7. So maybe the user's example included additional constraints not in the original problem? Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the example was incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter the problem and structure it with assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem had a typo, but in any case, according to the user's example, the assumptions are specific conditions on n (being integer and divisible by 7), and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSo applying that here: The original problem is to show that ℤ/nℤ is a field iff n is prime. So the problem is an equivalence, so the assumptions would include the two directions. However, according to the user's format, each assumption is a single property or condition on one object.\n\nIn this case, the problem is about the ring ℤ/nℤ, and n being prime. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring considered is ℤ/nℤ.\n- n is a natural number.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to split the problem into two parts? Wait, the example didn't split into two parts. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting that in some cases, the problem may have hidden assumptions that need to be made explicit.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user states \"Let n ∈ ℕ. Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\" So the given assumptions are that n is a natural number. The ring is ℤ/nℤ. Then the problem is to show equivalence to n being prime.\n\nSo the Assumptions section should list:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- The ring in question is ℤ/nℤ.\n\nBut the problem is to show that this ring is a field iff n is prime. So the problem statement is as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each direction's assumption. But according to the example, even if the original problem was a universal statement (\"for every integer n\"), the formatted problem included specific assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7). That suggests that the user wants to list all the given conditions in the problem as separate assumptions.\n\nIn this case, the original problem says \"Let n ∈ ℕ. Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\" Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- The ring is ℤ/nℤ.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the user is structuring the problem into a specific case, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem had a different statement but the user rephrased it, adding an assumption. But without seeing the original example's source, it's hard to tell. But according to the given instructions, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to show that ℤ/nℤ is a field iff n is prime, with n ∈ ℕ. Therefore, the assumptions are n is a natural number, and the ring is ℤ/nℤ. The problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nBut let's check the user's example again. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless the original problem had a different condition. Maybe the original problem had \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user wrote \"for every integer n\". Then the formatted problem corrected it. But without knowing, it's hard.\n\nAssuming the example is correct, perhaps the task is to extract all explicit and implicit assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the user wrote \"Let n ∈ ℕ. Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\" So the explicit assumptions are n ∈ ℕ and the ring is ℤ/nℤ. But the problem is to show equivalence to n being prime. Therefore, the problem is as stated.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nThe ring is ℤ/nℤ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\n\nBut let me check the original question again. The user's problem includes in the question details: Let n ∈ ℕ. Show that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field iff n is prime. Then they split into two directions: If n is prime, show every non-zero element has an inverse. Conversely, if ℤ/nℤ is a field, show n is prime.\n\nTherefore, the core problem is the equivalence. So the assumptions are n ∈ ℕ and the ring is ℤ/nℤ, and the problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number,\nThe ring considered is ℤ/nℤ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the ring ℤ/nℤ is a field if and only if n is prime.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions included specific conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7), even though the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe there's a misunderstanding in the example, but the user wants us to follow the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should list the conditions for each direction. But according to the user's instructions, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThus, in the current problem, the key assumptions are that n is a natural number and the ring is ℤ/nℤ. The problem is to establish the equivalence. So that's how it should be formatted.",
