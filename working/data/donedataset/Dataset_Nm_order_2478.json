    "Content": "Problem 1.4.1 of Model Theory by Chang and Keisler asks, Is there a theory of well order in the first-order language $\\{\\leq\\}$? I'm pretty sure the answer is no, since well order is a property of \"subsets\" or \"predicates\", and first-order sentences only allow quantifiers over \"individuals\".  However, I don't know how to prove this. In particular, for every $n$, the first-order sentence\n$$\\forall x_1 \\ldots x_n\\left(x_1 \\neq x_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge x_{n - 1} \\neq x_n \\rightarrow \\exists y\\left((y = x_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee y = x_n) \\wedge (y \\leq x_1 \\wedge \\cdots y \\leq x_n)\\right)\\right)$$\nsays that every subset of size $n$ has a least element, and I don't know how to rule out the possibility that it's possible to write down analogous sentences for infinite subsets (and that I just haven't found the right approach yet). How can I prove that there is no first-order theory of well order?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If there were such a theory, throw in countably many new constant symbols $c_1, c_2,\\dots$ and throw in the axioms $c_2 < c_1, c_3 < c_2, \\text{etc.}$ Now this new theory is consistent, since any finite subset of the axioms has a model (e.g. natural numbers under usual $<$ with the finitely many constants assigned appropriately), but that is a contradiction, since a model of the (whole) new theory is a well ordering with an infinite descending sequence.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking why there isn't a first-order theory of well order in the language with just the ≤ symbol. They mentioned that in Chang and Keisler's Model Theory book, problem 1.4.1 asks about this. The user is pretty sure the answer is no because well-ordering involves subsets or predicates, which first-order logic can't handle directly since it quantifies only over individuals. But they want a proof of this fact.\n\nThe user's confusion seems to be around the fact that for each finite n, you can write a first-order sentence that says every subset of size n has a least element. They provided an example formula for n elements, which essentially states that among any n distinct elements, there's a least one. But since well-ordering requires that every subset, including infinite ones, has a least element, they're wondering why we can't somehow capture that with first-order axioms, maybe by some clever use of infinitely many sentences or something else.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that first-order logic can't quantify over subsets directly; you can only quantify over elements of the domain. So the usual definition of well-order, which involves all subsets having a least element, is inherently second-order. The question is whether there's a first-order theory whose models are exactly the well-orders. \n\nThe user is thinking about the approach where for each finite n, you have a sentence that says every n-element subset has a least element. But even if you take all those sentences together (for every n), that doesn't ensure that every infinite subset has a least element. So the theory would have as its models the linear orders where every finite subset has a least element, which is just the same as being a linear order (since in any linear order, every finite non-empty subset has a least element). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in a linear order, every finite non-empty subset does have a least element. So those sentences are actually all tautologies in any linear order. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect?\n\nWait, let's check the sentence they wrote: For every n, the sentence says that if you have n distinct elements x1, ..., xn, then there exists a y which is equal to one of the xi and y is ≤ all of them. But in any linear order, given any finite set of elements, there is a least one among them. So that sentence is actually valid in all linear orders, right? So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because in any linear order, any finite subset has a least element. Therefore, those sentences don't actually add any new information beyond being a linear order. So the theory they're describing is just the theory of linear orders. Therefore, their approach is flawed.\n\nSo the problem is that the user thought those sentences capture something about well-orders, but actually they don't. Because in linear orders, finite subsets always have least elements, so those sentences are just part of the theory of linear orders. Therefore, the actual question is to show that there is no first-order theory in the language {≤} whose models are exactly the well-ordered sets.\n\nSo how do you prove that such a theory doesn't exist? The standard approach would be to use the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. If there were such a theory, then it would have models of all infinite cardinalities, including countable ones. But the minimal well-ordered sets are the ordinals, and for instance, the standard natural numbers with ≤ are a well-order. However, there are non-well-ordered linear orders that are elementarily equivalent to well-orders. For example, take the ordinal ω + ω^*. That is, the order type of the natural numbers followed by the negative integers. This is not a well-order because the negative integers have no least element. However, is this structure elementarily equivalent to a well-order?\n\nWait, perhaps we can use compactness. Suppose there is a theory T whose models are exactly the well-orders. Then, consider expanding the language with constants {c_i | i ∈ ω} and add axioms saying c_{i+1} < c_i for each i. This theory is finitely satisfiable because in any well-order, you can't have an infinite descending chain. Wait, but in a well-order, any such finite set of axioms would be satisfied by picking c0, c1, ..., cn in decreasing order, but you can't have an infinite descending chain. So by compactness, T would have a model with an infinite descending chain, which contradicts it being a well-order. Therefore, such a theory T cannot exist.\n\nAlternatively, using the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem: if T has an infinite well-order model (like ω), it must have a countable model. But a countable well-order is isomorphic to a countable ordinal. However, there are countable non-well-ordered linear orders that are elementarily equivalent. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps the better approach is the compactness argument.\n\nYes, the compactness argument is the standard way to show that well-orders aren't first-order axiomatizable. So, the answer should involve constructing a theory that extends the supposed well-order theory with infinitely many constants that form a descending chain, which is consistent by compactness, hence a model exists with an infinite descending chain, contradicting well-foundedness.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the fact that well-orders are not preserved under elementary equivalence. For example, take the ordinal ω, which is a well-order. But there exist models elementarily equivalent to ω that are not well-orders. For instance, take an ultrapower of ω over a non-principal ultrafilter on ω. The ultrapower will have elements corresponding to infinite sequences, which would be larger than all standard natural numbers, but such a model would not be well-ordered because you can have descending chains in the non-standard part.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is that the class of well-orders is not closed under elementary equivalence, hence cannot be axiomatized by a first-order theory.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the user's format:\n\nAssumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The original problem is about whether there's a first-order theory of well order in the language {≤}, and the user is trying to see how to prove that there isn't. The example given by the user in their question includes that for each n, there's a first-order sentence capturing that every n-element subset has a least element, but they want to rule out the possibility of such sentences for infinite subsets.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove that there's no first-order theory of well order. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include the language being {≤}, the definition of well-order (every non-empty subset has a least element), and that first-order logic can only quantify over individuals, not subsets. However, in the example given by the user in their initial example, the assumptions listed were specific to the problem's given conditions, like n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nWait, the user's example for the original problem had assumptions listed as specific conditions given in the problem. In the current problem, the user's question is more about the meta-properties of first-order logic. So perhaps the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The language is the first-order language with the binary relation symbol ≤.\n- Well-order is a property where every non-empty subset has a least element.\n- First-order theories can only quantify over elements, not subsets.\n\nBut the user's original question doesn't explicitly state these as assumptions, but they are part of the problem's context. However, in the original example, the assumptions were explicit in the problem statement. The problem here is more about the inability to capture well-order in first-order logic. So perhaps the assumptions in the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe language is $\\{\\leq\\}$,\nWell-order requires every non-empty subset to have a least element,\nFirst-order logic cannot quantify over subsets.\n\nBut maybe in the problem statement as presented, the key assumptions are part of the problem's setup. The problem is to prove there is no first-order theory of well order in the language {≤}. Therefore, the assumptions would be the context given in the problem: the language is {≤}, and the question is about first-order theories. So the formatted problem would list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first-order language is $\\{\\leq\\}$,\nA well order requires every non-empty subset to have a least element.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no first-order theory of well order.\n\nBut the user's example included specific mathematical objects (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, the assumptions are more about the logical framework. However, following the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first-order language includes the binary relation symbol $\\leq$,\nWell-order is a linear order where every non-empty subset has a least element,\nFirst-order theories can only quantify over elements of the domain.\n\nBut the problem is to show there's no such theory. So perhaps the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no first-order theory in the language $\\{\\leq\\}$ whose models are exactly the well-ordered sets.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe language of the theory is $\\{\\leq\\}$,\nA well-order requires every non-empty subset to have a least element,\nFirst-order logic quantifies only over elements, not subsets.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no first-order theory of well order.\n\nBut the user's original example had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. So here, the assumptions are the language, the definition of well-order, and the limitation of first-order logic. Each is a separate condition.\n\nSo the formatted problem would look like:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first-order language is $\\{\\leq\\}$,\nA well-order requires every non-empty subset to have a least element,\nFirst-order theories can only use quantification over elements.\nProblem:\nProve that there is no first-order theory of well order.\n\nBut perhaps the third assumption is redundant, as it's part of the definition of first-order logic. However, to match the user's example where assumptions are explicit conditions given in the problem, maybe it's better to list the necessary ones. Alternatively, since the problem is about the non-existence of such a theory, the key assumptions are the language and the definition of well-order.\n\nAlternatively, in the original problem, the user mentions that first-order sentences only allow quantifiers over individuals, which is a key point. Therefore, including that as an assumption.\n\nHence, the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first-order language is $\\{\\leq\\}$,\nWell-order is a linear order where every non-empty subset has a least element,\nFirst-order logic quantifiers range over individual elements, not subsets.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no first-order theory of well order.\n\nThis captures the key points needed to state the problem as per the user's example.",
