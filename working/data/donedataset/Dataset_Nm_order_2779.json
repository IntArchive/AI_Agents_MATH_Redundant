    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the key assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title is \"Polynomial ring $R[X] $ has zero Jacobson radical, for $R$ a domain.\" The question states: Let $R$ be a commutative domain. Prove that the Jacobson radical of $R[X]$, i.e. the intersection of all maximal ideals, is the zero ideal.\n\nSo, the main goal is to prove that the Jacobson radical of the polynomial ring $R[X]$ is zero, given that $R$ is a commutative domain. \n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. The problem says $R$ is a commutative domain. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. $R$ is a commutative ring.\n2. $R$ is a domain (i.e., it has no zero divisors).\n\nThese are two separate properties applied to the same object $R$, so each should be on its own line in the assumptions.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the Jacobson radical of $R[X]$ is the zero ideal. The Jacobson radical is defined as the intersection of all maximal ideals in the ring. So the problem statement is clear.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, sometimes assumptions might include more specific conditions. But here, the original problem states that $R$ is a commutative domain. So those are the two assumptions. There's no mention of $R$ being Noetherian or having any other properties, so we stick to what's given.\n\nNow, checking if I missed any other assumptions. The problem is about $R[X]$, but since $R$ is a commutative domain, $R[X]$ is also a commutative ring, and it's a domain as well. However, the problem doesn't require us to assume anything beyond what's stated for $R$. So the only assumptions are that $R$ is commutative and a domain.\n\nTherefore, structuring the answer as per the format:\n\nAssumption:\n- $R$ is a commutative ring.\n- $R$ is a domain.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Jacobson radical of $R[X]$ is the zero ideal.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, addressing one property of a single object. Here, both properties apply to $R$, so they are listed separately. The problem is stated concisely. There might be a question about whether the problem requires $R$ to be a domain or just commutative, but according to the original question, both are given. Therefore, the formatted problem should include both assumptions.",
