    "Content": "I'm working on an exercise from Atiyah and MacDonald's Commutative Algebra , and have hit a bump on Exercise 14 of Chapter 1. In a ring $A$, let $\\Sigma$ be the set of all ideals in which every element is a zero-divisor. Show that set $\\Sigma$ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of $\\Sigma$ is a prime ideal. Hence the set of zero-divisors in $A$ is a union of prime ideals. I see by an application of Zorn's Lemma that $\\Sigma$ has maximal elements. I take $\\mathfrak{m}$ to be maximal in $\\Sigma$, with $xy\\in\\mathfrak{m}$. Since $xy$ is a zero divisor, $xyz=0$ for some $z\\neq 0$. If $yz=0$, then $y$ is a zero divisor, otherwise $x$ is a zero divisor. So I guess I then want to show $x\\in\\Sigma$ or $y\\in\\Sigma$. If neither is, then $\\mathfrak{m}$ is properly contained in both $(\\mathfrak{m},x)$ and $(\\mathfrak{m},y)$. However, I'm not sure how to show either of these ideals is again in $\\Sigma$. If my understanding is correct, elements of $(\\mathfrak{m},x)$ are finite sums of the form $\\sum_ia_im_i+bx$ for $a_i\\in A$, $m_i\\in\\mathfrak{m}$ and $b\\in A$. To show this sum is a zero divisor, my hunch is that if $c_im_i=0$ for $c_i\\neq 0$ and $dx=0$ for $d\\neq 0$, then \n$$\n\\left(\\sum_ia_im_i+bx\\right)(d\\prod_ic_i)=0.\n$$\nMy concern is that perhaps $d\\prod_ic_i=0$, so the above wouldn't show that $(\\mathfrak{m},x)$ consists of only zero divisors. How can I get around this? Or is there perhaps a better approach? Thank you for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $\\frak{m}$ be a maximal element in $\\Sigma$. We want to show it is prime, i.e. that if $x\\notin\\frak{m}$ and $y\\notin\\frak{m}$, then $xy\\notin\\frak{m}$. If $x\\notin\\frak{m}$ and $y\\notin\\frak{m}$, then ${\\frak{m}}+(x)$ and ${\\frak{m}}+(y)$ are both ideals of $A$ that strictly contain $\\frak{m}$, and therefore each must contain non-zero-divisors ($\\frak{m}$ is maximal among ideals consisting only of zero-divisors, so any ideal strictly containing $\\frak{m}$ cannot consist only of zero-divisors). Thus the ideal $({\\frak{m}}+(x))({\\frak{m}}+(y))\\subseteq{\\frak{m}}+(xy)$ contains non-zero-divisors (because there is at least one non-zero-divisor in each of ${\\frak{m}}+(x)$ and ${\\frak{m}}+(y)$, and the product of two non-zero-divisors is a non-zero-divisor). But the fact that ${\\frak{m}}+(xy)$ contains non-zero-divisors implies that ${\\frak{m}}+(xy)$ strictly contains $\\frak{m}$, hence $xy\\notin\\frak{m}$. Thus $\\frak{m}$ is prime.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user is asking about Exercise 14 from Atiyah and MacDonald's Commutative Algebra. The main goal is to show that the set of zero-divisors in a ring A is a union of prime ideals. The problem breaks down into two parts: first, proving that the set Σ of ideals where every element is a zero-divisor has maximal elements, and second, showing that every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal. \n\nFrom the question, the user seems to understand that Zorn's Lemma applies for the existence of maximal elements in Σ. The confusion arises in the second part, where they need to show that a maximal element m in Σ is prime. The user's approach involves taking xy ∈ m and needing to show that either x or y is in m. The user's reasoning is that if xy is a zero divisor, then there exists z ≠ 0 such that xyz = 0. If yz ≠ 0, then x is a zero divisor, otherwise y is. But the user gets stuck on how to show that if neither x nor y is in m, then the ideals (m, x) and (m, y) would be in Σ, which would contradict the maximality of m.\n\nThe user's concern is about the elements of (m, x) being zero divisors. They consider that if you have an element like sum a_i m_i + bx, and you know each m_i is a zero divisor (with some annihilators c_i), and x is a zero divisor with annihilator d, then multiplying by d∏c_i should annihilate the sum. But they worry that d∏c_i might be zero, which would not help in showing the sum is a zero divisor. \n\nSo the key issue here is: how to ensure that there exists a non-zero element that annihilates the sum, given that each term in the sum is annihilated by some non-zero elements. The user might be missing that in a ring, the product of non-zero elements can be zero (if the ring has zero divisors), but in this case, since m is maximal in Σ, adding x to m would require that all elements of (m, x) are zero divisors. The problem is to show that such an annihilator exists. \n\nThe user is asking for a way around this problem or perhaps a different approach. The answer likely involves using the maximality of m to argue that if x is not in m, then (m, x) must contain a non-zero-divisor, leading to a contradiction. Alternatively, using the fact that if neither x nor y is in m, then (m, x) and (m, y) would have to contain elements that are not zero divisors, contradicting the maximality of m in Σ. \n\nBut to structure this into the required format, I need to list the assumptions from the problem. The original problem states that in a ring A, Σ is the set of ideals where every element is a zero-divisor. The task is to show Σ has maximal elements, each maximal element is prime, hence the set of zero-divisors is a union of prime ideals. \n\nThe assumptions would include that A is a commutative ring (since Atiyah-MacDonald deals with commutative algebra), Σ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor, and that maximal elements in Σ are considered under inclusion. The problem is to show that Σ has maximal elements and every maximal element is prime, leading to the conclusion about zero-divisors being a union of primes.\n\nWait, but the user's question specifically mentions their attempt and confusion. But the task here is to structure the original problem (from the user's post) into the specified format. So the original problem is: Show that the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals by showing Σ has maximal elements, each of which is prime. So the assumptions are about the ring A, the set Σ, and properties of ideals in Σ. \n\nSo the Assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a commutative ring.\n\n- Σ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\n- Maximal elements in Σ are considered with respect to inclusion.\n\nThe problem is to show that Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element is a prime ideal, hence the set of zero-divisors is a union of prime ideals.\n\nBut the user's own problem statement might have more details. Let me check the original question again:\n\n\"In a ring A, let Σ be the set of all ideals in which every element is a zero-divisor. Show that set Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal. Hence the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\"\n\nSo the assumptions from the problem:\n\n- A is a ring (but since it's from Atiyah-MacDonald, which deals with commutative rings, we can assume commutative unless stated otherwise, but maybe not? Wait, the original problem doesn't specify commutative? Wait, the user mentions \"prime ideals,\" which in non-commutative rings can have different definitions, but in Atiyah-MacDonald, it's commutative. So assumption: A is a commutative ring.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the user's question does not explicitly say A is commutative. Wait, the user says \"In a ring A\", but Atiyah-MacDonald's context is commutative. However, unless specified, maybe we shouldn't assume commutativity. Wait, but the standard definition of prime ideals in commutative rings is that if ab ∈ P, then a ∈ P or b ∈ P. In non-commutative, it's different. But the problem statement refers to the standard commutative case. So I think the assumption is that A is a commutative ring. Also, the user's attempted proof uses commutative properties (like xy ∈ m implies x or y in m).\n\nThus, the assumptions would include:\n\n- A is a commutative ring.\n\n- Σ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\n- The partial order on Σ is inclusion.\n\nThe problem is to show that Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element is a prime ideal, hence the set of zero-divisors is a union of prime ideals.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a commutative ring.\n\n- Σ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\n- Maximal elements in Σ are considered under inclusion.\n\nWait, but \"maximal elements in Σ are considered under inclusion\" is part of the problem's setup, not an assumption given. The problem states \"Show that Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a commutative ring.\n\n- Σ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\nThe problem is to show that Σ has maximal elements and every maximal element is a prime ideal, hence the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\n\nBut the problem may not need the assumption that A is commutative if it's true for general rings. But since the original exercise is from Atiyah-MacDonald, which is about commutative rings, we can safely include that as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a commutative ring,\nΣ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\nProblem:\nShow that Σ has maximal elements, every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal, and hence the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions \"Hence the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\" So the problem is to show three things: existence of maximal elements in Σ, maximal elements are prime, hence the conclusion. But perhaps in the problem statement, we can state it as per the user's original question.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Show that set Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal. Hence the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\"\n\nSo the problem is to show the two things and then conclude the union. So the problem line should be as stated.\n\nBut the example given by the user included assumptions line by line. In the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this problem, the assumptions are about the ring and Σ. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a commutative ring,\nΣ is the set of ideals in A where every element is a zero-divisor.\n\nProblem:\nShow that Σ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of Σ is a prime ideal. Hence, the set of zero-divisors in A is a union of prime ideals.\n\nThat seems correct. The user's own problem statement didn't mention commutativity, but since it's from Atiyah-MacDonald, it's safe to include it as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem works for non-commutative rings? Probably not, because the definition of prime ideals differs. Hence, including commutativity is part of the problem's assumptions.",
