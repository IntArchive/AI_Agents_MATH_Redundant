I don't understand how the author comes to this inequality. Can anyone provide some hints?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It can be quite simple: let $c=\\max\\{|a|,|b|\\}$ so that\n$$\n|a+b|\\leq |a|+|b|\\leq 2c\\implies |a+b|^p\\leq (2c)^p=2^p(c^p)\\leq 2^p(|a|^p+|b|^p).\n$$\nIn fact, you only need $p\\geq 0$. Edit : As Winther indicates elsewhere in this thread, $p\\geq 1$ gives you a stronger result. I'll give a proof using the convexity of a different function than one he suggests. Let $g(x)=x^p$ defined on $[0,\\infty)$ and $m=|a|$ and $n=|b|$. We would like to prove $|a+b|^p\\leq 2^{p-1}(|a|^p+|b|^p)$. By the triangle inequality above, it suffices to show\n\\begin{align*}\n(m+n)^p\\leq 2^{p-1}(m^p+n^p)&\\iff\\left(\\frac{1}{2}m+\\frac{1}{2}n\\right)^p\\leq\\frac{1}{2}m^p+\\frac{1}{2}n^p\\\\\n&\\iff g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}m+\\frac{1}{2}n\\right)\\leq\\frac{1}{2}g(m)+\\frac{1}{2}g(n)\n\\end{align*}\nwhich is true due to the convexity of $g$. It is here that we need $p\\geq 1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this inequality problem. The user wants to prove that for any real numbers a and b, and for p being at least 1 but less than infinity, the inequality |a + b|^p ≤ 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p) holds. They mentioned this is from Royden's Real Analysis book, and they need some hints.\n\nFirst, I should recall some standard inequalities that might be useful here. Since p is ≥1, maybe the triangle inequality could come into play. The regular triangle inequality tells us that |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|. But here we have an exponent p on the left side. So perhaps we can start by applying the triangle inequality first and then raise both sides to the power p?\n\nWait, but raising inequalities to a power can be tricky. For example, if both sides are positive (which they are here, since absolute values are non-negative), then if the inequality holds and the function is increasing, the direction is preserved. Since p ≥1, the function x^p is increasing for x ≥0. So if we have |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|, then raising both sides to the p would give |a + b|^p ≤ (|a| + |b|)^p. But the right-hand side in the problem is 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). So how do we relate (|a| + |b|)^p to 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p)?\n\nHmm, maybe we can use the convexity of the function x^p for p ≥1. Since the function is convex, we might apply Jensen's inequality. Let's recall that for convex functions, Jensen's inequality states that f((x + y)/2) ≤ (f(x) + f(y))/2). If we set x = |a| and y = |b|, then maybe (|a| + |b|)/2 would relate here. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf we take f(t) = t^p, which is convex because p ≥1. Then by Jensen's inequality, f((|a| + |b|)/2) ≤ (f(|a|) + f(|b|))/2). Multiplying both sides by 2^p, we get (|a| + |b|)^p ≤ 2^{p-1} (|a|^p + |b|^p). Wait, that's interesting. Let me check that again.\n\nJensen's inequality for convex function f: f( (x + y)/2 ) ≤ (f(x) + f(y))/2. So substituting x = |a|, y = |b|, we have ( (|a| + |b|)/2 )^p ≤ ( |a|^p + |b|^p ) / 2. Multiply both sides by 2^p: (|a| + |b|)^p ≤ 2^{p -1} (|a|^p + |b|^p). \n\nSo then, combining this with the triangle inequality, which says |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|, we have |a + b|^p ≤ (|a| + |b|)^p ≤ 2^{p -1} (|a|^p + |b|^p). But the problem statement wants 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). Wait, but 2^{p -1} is less than 2^p, so actually the inequality we derived is tighter. So maybe the problem statement has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something?\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: |a + b|^p ≤ 2^p { |a|^p + |b|^p }.\n\nBut according to our steps, we can get |a + b|^p ≤ 2^{p -1} (|a|^p + |b|^p). So there's a discrepancy in the constant. Maybe the problem in Royden actually uses 2^{p} instead of 2^{p -1}, but why? Perhaps there's another approach where the constant is 2^p instead of 2^{p -1}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author used a different method. Let's think again. Suppose instead of using Jensen's inequality, we use a different inequality. For example, since (|a| + |b|) ≤ 2 max{|a|, |b|}, then (|a| + |b|)^p ≤ (2 max{|a|, |b|})^p = 2^p (max{|a|, |b|})^p. But since max{|a|, |b|} ≤ |a| + |b|, maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that for any real numbers x and y, (x + y)^p ≤ 2^{p-1}(x^p + y^p). Wait, this is the same as what we obtained through Jensen's inequality. So if that's the case, then the problem as stated in Royden might have a typo, or perhaps the user misquoted it. But according to the user, the problem in Royden says 2^p instead of 2^{p-1}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's try using Hölder's inequality? Not sure. Or maybe Minkowski's inequality? Wait, Minkowski's inequality states that (|a + b|^p)^{1/p} ≤ (|a|^p)^{1/p} + (|b|^p)^{1/p}, which is the triangle inequality in L^p spaces. But that gives |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|, which again leads us back to the same point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the convexity of x^p again but in a different way. Let me think. Since p ≥1, the function x^p is convex, so for any t in [0,1], (ta + (1-t)b)^p ≤ t a^p + (1-t) b^p. But not sure if that helps here.\n\nWait, maybe instead of applying Jensen's to |a| and |b|, we can think of |a + b|^p ≤ (|a| + |b|)^p, then expand (|a| + |b|)^p using the binomial theorem. But that would give a sum of terms involving |a|^k |b|^{p -k}, which might not directly lead to 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). However, if we bound each term in the binomial expansion. Let's see:\n\n(|a| + |b|)^p = Σ_{k=0}^p (p choose k) |a|^k |b|^{p -k}. To compare this with 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). But Σ_{k=0}^p (p choose k) |a|^k |b|^{p -k} is actually equal to (|a| + |b|)^p, which is different from 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). Unless we can bound each term such that the sum is less than or equal to 2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that for non-negative x and y, (x + y)^p ≤ 2^{p} (x^p + y^p). Is this true? Let's test for p=1. Then (x + y) ≤ 2(x + y), which is true. For p=2, (x + y)^2 ≤ 4(x^2 + y^2). Expanding left side: x^2 + 2xy + y^2. Compare to 4x^2 + 4y^2. So 2xy ≤ 3x^2 + 3y^2. Which is true because 3x^2 + 3y^2 - 2xy = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + (x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + (x - y)^2 ≥0. So yes, for p=2, the inequality holds. For p=1, it's an equality multiplied by 2.\n\nSo maybe in general, (x + y)^p ≤ 2^p (x^p + y^p) for x, y ≥0 and p ≥1. Let's check p=1.5. Take x=1, y=1. Then (2)^{1.5} = 2*sqrt(2) ≈2.828. Right-hand side: 2^{1.5}*(1 +1) = 2^{1.5}*2 = 2^{2.5} = 5.656. So 2.828 ≤5.656, which holds. If x=1, y=0. Left side:1, right side:2^p *1. Since 2^p ≥1 for p≥0, holds. If x and y are different, say x=3, y=1, p=2. Left: (4)^2=16. Right:4*(9 +1)=40. 16≤40. Yes. So in general, it seems that (x + y)^p ≤2^p (x^p + y^p). So then if we combine this with the triangle inequality:\n\n|a + b|^p ≤ (|a| + |b|)^p ≤2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). Hence, the inequality holds. But wait, how do we justify (x + y)^p ≤2^p (x^p + y^p)? Is there a general proof for this?\n\nYes, using the convexity and the fact that for any t ≥0, (x + y)^p ≤ (2 max{x, y})^p =2^p max{x, y}^p ≤2^p (x^p + y^p). Because max{x, y}^p ≤x^p + y^p. Hence, combining these inequalities:\n\n(x + y)^p ≤ (2 max{x, y})^p =2^p max{x, y}^p ≤2^p (x^p + y^p).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the power mean. For non-negative real numbers x and y, the power mean of order p is ((x^p + y^p)/2)^{1/p}. The arithmetic mean is (x + y)/2. For p ≥1, the power mean is greater than or equal to the arithmetic mean, so:\n\n((x + y)/2) ≤ ((x^p + y^p)/2)^{1/p}\n\nRaising both sides to the p:\n\n((x + y)/2)^p ≤ (x^p + y^p)/2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2^p:\n\n(x + y)^p ≤2^{p -1} (x^p + y^p)\n\nWait, this is the same result as before with Jensen's inequality. So there's a contradiction here because when we use the power mean inequality, we get 2^{p -1} (x^p + y^p), but when we use the max{x,y} approach, we get 2^p (x^p + y^p). Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's take p=1. Then according to the first method, (x + y) ≤2^{1 -1}(x + y)=1*(x + y), which is equality. According to the max method, (x + y) ≤2 max{x, y} ≤2(x + y), which is also true. So both give valid inequalities but with different constants. The power mean gives a tighter bound (smaller constant), but the problem statement uses the larger constant 2^p. So perhaps the problem is stated correctly, and even though there is a tighter inequality, the author uses a more straightforward bound with 2^p.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the intended proof is:\n\n1. Apply the triangle inequality: |a + b| ≤|a| + |b|.\n\n2. Then note that |a| + |b| ≤2 max{|a|, |b|}.\n\n3. Therefore, |a + b|^p ≤(2 max{|a|, |b|})^p =2^p (max{|a|, |b|})^p.\n\n4. Now, since max{|a|, |b|} ≤|a| + |b|, but we need to relate it to |a|^p + |b|^p. However, note that (max{|a|, |b|})^p ≤|a|^p + |b|^p. Because if, say, |a| ≥|b|, then |a|^p ≤|a|^p + |b|^p. Similarly for |b| ≥|a|.\n\nTherefore, combining steps 3 and 4: |a + b|^p ≤2^p (max{|a|, |b|})^p ≤2^p (|a|^p + |b|^p). Hence, the inequality holds.\n\nThis seems to work. So the key steps are triangle inequality, bounding the sum by twice the maximum, then noting that the maximum to the p is less than the sum of the p-th powers.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the convexity of the function f(x) = |x|^p. Since p ≥1, this function is convex, so for any t in [0,1], f(tx + (1-t)y) ≤tf(x) + (1-t)f(y). Let t=1/2, then f((x + y)/2) ≤ (f(x) + f(y))/2. Multiplying both sides by 2^p gives f(x + y) ≤2^{p-1}(f(x) + f(y)). Wait, but this again gives the tighter bound. However, the problem wants 2^p instead of 2^{p-1}. Therefore, if the user follows the first method (using max), they can get the required inequality with 2^p, even though it's a looser bound.\n\nBut why does the book state 2^p then? Maybe because the proof using the maximum is simpler, and the loss of a factor of 2 is acceptable in their context. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, but given that the user confirms it's from Royden, we should proceed to prove it as stated.\n\nTherefore, the problem's inequality can be proven by first applying the triangle inequality, then bounding the sum by twice the maximum, and then noting that the maximum to the p-th power is bounded by the sum of the p-th powers. This would give the desired result with 2^p.\n\nSo the assumptions here are that a and b are real numbers, p is a real number between 1 and infinity (since it's 1 ≤p <∞), and the problem is to prove that inequality. But when structuring the assumptions, each line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a real number.\n\n- b is a real number.\n\n- p is a real number.\n\n- p satisfies 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, it's given that \"For any real numbers a and b and 1 ≤ p < ∞\", so these are the assumptions. Each of these can be listed as separate assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\nb is a real number,\np is a real number,\np satisfies 1 ≤ p < ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$|a+b|^p \\leq 2^p \\{ |a|^p +|b|^p \\}$$.\n\nThat's it. The user didn't mention any additional conditions like a and b being non-negative or anything else, so those are the only assumptions.",
