    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that a fourth-degree polynomial with all real roots cannot have all coefficients as ±1. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The polynomial is of degree 4, has real roots, and all coefficients are either +1 or -1. The claim is that such a polynomial cannot exist. So, the task is to show why this is impossible.\n\nLet me start by writing a general form of a quartic polynomial with coefficients ±1. Let's denote it as P(x) = x⁴ ± x³ ± x² ± x ± 1. Since all coefficients are ±1, there are 2^4 = 16 possible combinations, but considering the leading coefficient is 1 (since it's a monic polynomial; though the problem doesn't specify monic, but usually, coefficients include the leading term. Wait, actually, the problem says \"all its coefficients\" are ±1, so the leading coefficient is also ±1. Hmm, but if the leading coefficient is -1, we could factor that out and consider a monic polynomial. Maybe that's a point to consider. However, for simplicity, perhaps assume the leading coefficient is 1, but the problem allows ±1. But the key is all coefficients, including the leading term, are ±1. So possible polynomials could be, for example, x⁴ + x³ + x² + x + 1, or x⁴ - x³ + x² - x + 1, etc., but all combinations where each coefficient (x⁴, x³, x², x, constant term) is either +1 or -1.\n\nNow, the polynomial has all real roots. So, for a quartic to have all real roots, it must factor into (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d), where a, b, c, d are real numbers. Then, when expanded, the coefficients are determined by the elementary symmetric sums of the roots.\n\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are related to the roots via Vieta's formula. For a quartic x⁴ + p x³ + q x² + r x + s, we have:\n\np = -(a + b + c + d)\n\nq = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd\n\nr = - (abc + abd + acd + bcd)\n\ns = abcd\n\nBut in our case, each of p, q, r, s must be either +1 or -1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to showing that there do not exist real numbers a, b, c, d such that the symmetric sums p, q, r, s as defined above are all ±1.\n\nAlternatively, we need to show that such a system of equations (with p, q, r, s each ±1) has no real solution for a, b, c, d.\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, maybe consider specific cases. For example, take the polynomial x⁴ + x³ + x² + x + 1. But wait, this polynomial doesn't have real roots; it's a cyclotomic polynomial and all roots are complex roots of unity. Similarly, if we take other combinations, maybe they don't have real roots. But the user says that the polynomial in question does have all real roots, so we need to show that such a combination is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use calculus as the user tried. If a quartic has all real roots, then its derivative (a cubic) must also have all real roots (by Rolle's theorem). Then the second derivative (quadratic) must have all real roots, and the third derivative (linear) as well. But I'm not sure how helpful that is here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the polynomial and all its derivatives must have all real roots, leading to certain inequalities on the coefficients. But this might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach: consider the possible values of the symmetric sums. Since all coefficients are ±1, the sums p, q, r, s are constrained. Let's write out the equations:\n\n1. -(a + b + c + d) = p ∈ {-1, 1}\n2. ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = q ∈ {-1, 1}\n3. -(abc + abd + acd + bcd) = r ∈ {-1, 1}\n4. abcd = s ∈ {-1, 1}\n\nSo, we have four equations with variables a, b, c, d real numbers, and each equation's right-hand side is either -1 or 1.\n\nLet me try to see if such a system can be satisfied.\n\nSuppose we take s = abcd = 1. Then the product of the roots is 1. Similarly, if s = -1, then the product is -1.\n\nBut regardless, the challenge is to find real numbers a, b, c, d such that all these sums are ±1.\n\nLet me consider possible values. For example, suppose all roots are equal. Then, we have a quadruple root. But in that case, the polynomial would be (x - a)^4, which when expanded has coefficients 1, -4a, 6a², -4a³, a⁴. But these coefficients would have to be ±1, which is impossible except for specific a. For example, 6a² = ±1 ⇒ a² = 1/6 ⇒ a = ±1/√6. Then -4a³ would be -4*(±1)/(6√6) = ∓4/(6√6) = ∓2/(3√6), which is not ±1. So equal roots case doesn't work.\n\nWhat if two roots are equal? Maybe two pairs of equal roots. Suppose (x - a)^2 (x - b)^2. Expanding gives x⁴ - 2(a + b)x³ + (a² + 4ab + b²)x² - 2ab(a + b)x + a²b². Coefficients:\n\np = -2(a + b)\n\nq = a² + 4ab + b²\n\nr = -2ab(a + b)\n\ns = a²b²\n\nEach of these must be ±1. Let's see:\n\nFrom s = a²b² = (ab)^2. So s must be 1, since squares are non-negative and s is either ±1. So s = 1 ⇒ ab = ±1.\n\nFrom p = -2(a + b) ∈ {-1, 1}. So a + b = ±1/2.\n\nFrom r = -2ab(a + b). Since ab = ±1, and a + b = ±1/2, then r = -2*(±1)*(±1/2) = -2*(±1/2) = ∓1. So r must be either -1 or 1. But r is supposed to be ±1, so that works.\n\nNow, let's take s = 1, so ab = 1 or ab = -1.\n\nCase 1: ab = 1\n\nThen, from p = -2(a + b) = ±1 ⇒ a + b = ∓1/2.\n\nFrom r = -2*(1)*(a + b) = -2*(∓1/2) = ±1. So r = ±1, which is allowed.\n\nNow, q = a² + 4ab + b² = (a + b)^2 + 2ab. Since ab = 1, this becomes (a + b)^2 + 2*1 = (a + b)^2 + 2.\n\nBut (a + b)^2 = (±1/2)^2 = 1/4. So q = 1/4 + 2 = 9/4 = 2.25, which is not ±1. So this case fails because q must be ±1.\n\nCase 2: ab = -1\n\nSimilarly, a + b = ±1/2.\n\nThen, q = a² + 4ab + b² = (a + b)^2 + 2ab = (a + b)^2 + 2*(-1) = (a + b)^2 - 2.\n\nIf (a + b)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, then q = 1/4 - 2 = -7/4 = -1.75, which is not ±1. So again, q is not ±1.\n\nThus, even with two double roots, it's impossible to satisfy all coefficient conditions. So maybe polynomials with multiple roots don't work.\n\nAlternatively, consider distinct roots. Maybe symmetric roots? For example, if the roots are a, -a, b, -b. Then the polynomial would be (x² - a²)(x² - b²) = x⁴ - (a² + b²)x² + a²b². Here, the coefficients of x³ and x are zero, which would mean that in our problem, those coefficients must be ±1. But in this case, they are zero, which is not allowed. So symmetric roots like that won't work unless they produce non-zero coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, consider a polynomial with roots all equal to 1 or -1. For example, (x - 1)^4 would have coefficients 1, -4, 6, -4, 1. But the coefficients here are not all ±1. Similarly, combining 1 and -1 roots. For example, (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1) = (x² - 1)^2 = x⁴ - 2x² + 1. Coefficients are 1, 0, -2, 0, 1. Again, zeros are present, which violates the ±1 condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three roots at 1 and one at -1: (x - 1)^3(x + 1) = x⁴ - 2x³ + 0x² + 2x -1. Coefficients: 1, -2, 0, 2, -1. Again, there's a zero coefficient and coefficients like -2 and 2, which are not ±1.\n\nThus, using roots at 1 or -1 won't work because the coefficients end up being too large or zero.\n\nAnother approach: Use Vieta’s formulas and try to derive a contradiction.\n\nLet’s suppose such a polynomial exists. Then, we have:\n\nLet’s denote the polynomial as P(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d, where each of a, b, c, d is ±1.\n\nGiven that all roots are real, say r1, r2, r3, r4. Then:\n\nSum of roots: r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 = -a.\n\nSum of products two at a time: r1r2 + r1r3 + r1r4 + r2r3 + r2r4 + r3r4 = b.\n\nSum of products three at a time: r1r2r3 + r1r2r4 + r1r3r4 + r2r3r4 = -c.\n\nProduct of roots: r1r2r3r4 = d.\n\nEach of these sums is either ±1. So, we need to find real numbers r1, r2, r3, r4 such that these four equations hold with a, b, c, d each ±1.\n\nLet’s see if we can find any contradictions here.\n\nFirst, consider the product of roots d = ±1. If d = 1, then the product of the roots is 1. If d = -1, the product is -1.\n\nLet’s consider the case d = 1. Then r1r2r3r4 = 1. All roots are real, so they can be positive or negative. But the product of four real numbers being 1. That could be possible with an even number of negative roots, for example.\n\nSimilarly, if d = -1, then there must be an odd number of negative roots.\n\nNow, consider the sum of roots: S = -a, which is either 1 or -1. So the sum of roots is ±1.\n\nNext, the sum of products two at a time is b = ±1.\n\nThe sum of products three at a time is -c = ±1, so the sum is either 1 or -1.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can use inequalities involving these sums. For example, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM ≥ GM.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for real numbers, certain inequalities must hold. For example, the square of the sum of the roots is related to the sum of the squares plus twice the sum of the products two at a time.\n\nLet’s compute S² = (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4)^2 = r1² + r2² + r3² + r4² + 2(r1r2 + r1r3 + r1r4 + r2r3 + r2r4 + r3r4).\n\nSo, S² = sum of squares + 2b.\n\nBut sum of squares is always non-negative, so S² ≥ 2b. Since S = ±1, S² = 1. Therefore:\n\n1 ≥ 2b ⇒ since b is ±1, 1 ≥ 2b.\n\nIf b = 1, then 1 ≥ 2*1 ⇒ 1 ≥ 2, which is false.\n\nIf b = -1, then 1 ≥ 2*(-1) ⇒ 1 ≥ -2, which is true.\n\nTherefore, this implies that b must be -1. Otherwise, if b = 1, the inequality 1 ≥ 2 is false. Thus, b cannot be 1. Therefore, b must be -1.\n\nSo, from this, we can conclude that b = -1.\n\nSo that's one condition. Now, we have b = -1.\n\nSimilarly, let's think about other relations. For example, the sum of the products three at a time is equal to -c. Let's denote T = r1r2r3 + r1r2r4 + r1r3r4 + r2r3r4 = -c.\n\nAlso, the product of all roots is d = ±1.\n\nPerhaps we can relate T to S and P (product). Let's see:\n\nWe can write T = (r1r2r3 + r1r2r4 + r1r3r4 + r2r3r4) = (r1r2 + r1r3 + r1r4 + r2r3 + r2r4 + r3r4)(r1 + r2 + r3 + r4) - (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4)(r1r2 + r1r3 + r1r4 + r2r3 + r2r4 + r3r4) + ... Wait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, recall that in symmetric sums, T can be expressed as S * Q - sum(r_i^3), but I might need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider using Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case where all roots are equal to 1 or -1. Wait, we saw earlier that this doesn't work because the coefficients become too large or zero. But perhaps a mix of other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, assume that two roots are reciprocals, say r and 1/r, to make the product terms manageable. For instance, if two roots are r and 1/r, then their product is 1. If we have two such pairs, then the overall product is 1*1=1. Let's try this.\n\nSuppose the roots are r, 1/r, s, 1/s. Then the product is 1. The sum S = r + 1/r + s + 1/s = ±1. The sum of products two at a time is r*(1/r) + r*s + r*(1/s) + (1/r)*s + (1/r)*(1/s) + s*(1/s) = 1 + rs + r/s + s/r + 1/(rs) + 1. So total sum q = 2 + rs + r/s + s/r + 1/(rs). But q must be -1. So 2 + rs + r/s + s/r + 1/(rs) = -1 ⇒ rs + r/s + s/r + 1/(rs) = -3.\n\nLet me denote t = rs + 1/(rs). Then, note that r/s + s/r = (r² + s²)/(rs). Let’s see:\n\nWait, maybe set u = rs. Then rs + 1/(rs) = u + 1/u. Also, r/s + s/r = (r² + s²)/(rs) = ( (r + s)^2 - 2rs ) / rs = ( (r + s)^2 )/rs - 2.\n\nBut this might not help. Alternatively, if u = rs, then the expression becomes u + 1/u + (r/s + s/r). But r/s = (r^2)/(rs) = (r^2)/u, and s/r = (s^2)/u. Unless r = s, which would make it 2/u. But this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set r = s. Then, we have roots r, 1/r, r, 1/r. Then the sum S = 2(r + 1/r) = ±1 ⇒ r + 1/r = ±1/2. But r + 1/r ≥ 2 if r > 0, or ≤ -2 if r < 0. So ±1/2 is impossible. Hence, this case cannot happen.\n\nSo even if we assume reciprocal pairs, the sum S cannot be achieved.\n\nAnother angle: Use the AM ≥ GM inequality on the roots. For example, for four real numbers, certain inequalities must hold.\n\nFor instance, the product of the roots is d = ±1. If all roots are positive, then by AM ≥ GM, (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4)/4 ≥ (r1r2r3r4)^(1/4) = 1^(1/4) = 1. So if d = 1 and all roots positive, then the sum S = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 ≥ 4. But S is ±1, which contradicts. Hence, if all roots are positive, impossible. Similarly, if d = -1, then the product is -1, so there must be an odd number of negative roots. Suppose three negative and one positive. Then, the sum S would be sum of three negative and one positive. But need S = ±1. Maybe possible, but difficult to see.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d, with a, b, c, d = ±1. We need to show that this polynomial cannot have all real roots.\n\nPerhaps analyze the possible Descartes' Rule of Signs variations. The number of positive real roots is equal to the number of sign changes or less by multiple of 2. Similarly for negative roots by substituting x → -x.\n\nBut since the coefficients are ±1, the sign changes can be analyzed. For example, take a polynomial like x⁴ + x³ + x² + x + 1. This has zero sign changes, so no positive roots. If we take x⁴ - x³ + x² - x + 1, there are four sign changes, so up to four positive roots, or 2, or 0. But the original problem states that the polynomial has all real roots, so it must have four real roots. But Descartes' Rule only gives upper bounds. For example, a quartic with four sign changes can have 4, 2, or 0 positive roots. Similarly for negative roots. But if the polynomial must have four real roots, then all four must be accounted for in positive and negative roots. But this line of reasoning might not directly lead to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but if all roots are real, then the polynomial must split into linear factors over the reals. So, it must have four real roots (counting multiplicities). So, for example, if all roots are positive, then as we saw, sum of roots would be ≥4, contradicting S=±1. If some roots are negative, then maybe the sum can be smaller.\n\nBut let's think of another approach. Suppose we take the polynomial and its derivatives. Since all roots are real, all derivatives must also have all real roots. The first derivative is 4x³ + 3a x² + 2b x + c. For this cubic to have all real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative. Similarly, the second derivative is 12x² + 6a x + 2b, which must have two real roots, so discriminant (6a)^2 - 4*12*2b ≥ 0 ⇒ 36a² - 96b ≥ 0 ⇒ 36(±1)^2 -96(±1) ≥0 ⇒ 36 -96b ≥0. Since b is ±1, if b=1, 36 -96*1 = -60 <0, which is invalid. If b=-1, 36 -96*(-1)=36+96=132 ≥0. Hence, for the second derivative to have real roots, we must have b=-1. Which aligns with our previous conclusion from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that b must be -1.\n\nSo, from the second derivative discriminant condition, b must be -1. Therefore, in any such polynomial, the coefficient of x² must be -1.\n\nSimilarly, the cubic derivative's discriminant must be non-negative. Let's compute that.\n\nThe first derivative is 4x³ + 3a x² + 2b x + c. For a cubic ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the discriminant Δ = 18abcd -4b³d + b²c² - 4ac³ - 27a²d².\n\nIn our case, the cubic is 4x³ + 3a x² + 2b x + c. So, a_cubic = 4, b_cubic = 3a, c_cubic = 2b, d_cubic = c.\n\nDiscriminant Δ = 18*(4)*(3a)*(2b)*c -4*(3a)^3*c + (3a)^2*(2b)^2 -4*(4)*(2b)^3 -27*(4)^2*c^2.\n\nThis is quite complicated, but since b = -1, let's substitute b = -1.\n\nΔ = 18*4*3a*2*(-1)*c -4*(3a)^3*c + (3a)^2*(2*(-1))^2 -4*4*(2*(-1))^3 -27*16*c^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 18*4*3a*2*(-1)*c = 18*4*3*2*(-1)*a*c = 18*24*(-1)*a*c = -432 a c\n\nSecond term: -4*(27 a³)*c = -108 a³ c\n\nThird term: 9a² *4 = 36 a²\n\nFourth term: -4*4*(-8) = -4*4*(-8) = 128\n\nFifth term: -27*16 c² = -432 c²\n\nSo Δ = -432 a c -108 a³ c + 36 a² + 128 -432 c²\n\nFor the cubic to have all real roots, Δ ≥0.\n\nBut this expression must be non-negative for some a, c ∈ {-1, 1}.\n\nLet’s substitute possible values of a and c.\n\nThere are four possibilities: a=1 or -1, c=1 or -1.\n\nCase 1: a=1, c=1\n\nΔ = -432*1*1 -108*1*1 + 36*1 + 128 -432*1 = -432 -108 + 36 + 128 -432 = (-432 -108 -432) + (36 +128) = (-972) + 164 = -808 <0\n\nNot valid.\n\nCase 2: a=1, c=-1\n\nΔ = -432*1*(-1) -108*1*(-1) +36*1 +128 -432*(-1)^2\n\n= 432 + 108 +36 +128 -432\n\n= (432 -432) + (108 +36 +128) = 0 + 272 = 272 ≥0\n\nValid.\n\nCase3: a=-1, c=1\n\nΔ = -432*(-1)*1 -108*(-1)^3*1 +36*(-1)^2 +128 -432*(1)^2\n\n= 432 -108*(-1)*1 +36*1 +128 -432\n\n= 432 +108 +36 +128 -432\n\n= (432 -432) + (108 +36 +128) = 0 + 272 = 272 ≥0\n\nValid.\n\nCase4: a=-1, c=-1\n\nΔ = -432*(-1)*(-1) -108*(-1)^3*(-1) +36*(-1)^2 +128 -432*(-1)^2\n\n= -432*1 -108*(1)*(-1) +36*1 +128 -432*1\n\n= -432 +108 +36 +128 -432\n\n= (-432 -432) + (108 +36 +128) = -864 + 272 = -592 <0\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo, only when (a=1,c=-1) or (a=-1,c=1) does the discriminant satisfy Δ ≥0.\n\nThus, possible combinations for a and c are (1,-1) and (-1,1).\n\nRecall that b must be -1, and d is either 1 or -1.\n\nSo, possible polynomials are:\n\n1. x⁴ + x³ - x² - x + d\n\n2. x⁴ - x³ - x² + x + d\n\nWhere d is ±1.\n\nNow, we need to check if these polynomials can have all real roots.\n\nLet’s take the first case: P(x) = x⁴ + x³ - x² - x + d.\n\nWe can attempt to factor this polynomial or check its behavior.\n\nCompute P(1): 1 +1 -1 -1 +d = 0 + d = d. So P(1) = d. Similarly, P(-1): 1 -1 -1 +1 +d = 0 +d = d.\n\nSo at x=1 and x=-1, the value is d. If d=1, then P(1)=1, P(-1)=1. If d=-1, P(1)=-1, P(-1)=-1.\n\nLet’s analyze for d=1: P(x)=x⁴ +x³ -x² -x +1.\n\nCompute the derivative: 4x³ +3x² -2x -1.\n\nCheck critical points. Maybe use rational root theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.\n\nTest x=1: 4 +3 -2 -1=4≠0.\n\nx=-1: -4 +3 +2 -1=0. So x=-1 is a root. Factor the derivative as (x+1)(4x² -x -1).\n\nSolve 4x² -x -1=0. Discriminant=1 +16=17. Roots (1 ±√17)/8. So real roots. Hence, the derivative has three real roots. So the original function may have local maxima and minima.\n\nBut does P(x) cross the x-axis four times? Let’s check the behavior as x→±∞. As x→±∞, P(x)→+∞. At x=0, P(0)=1. At x=1, P(1)=1. At x=-1, P(-1)=1. So the polynomial is positive at x=0,1,-1, and tends to infinity at both ends. So it might have minima that are above the x-axis, meaning no real roots. But wait, the original assumption is that the polynomial has all real roots. If this polynomial is positive everywhere, then it has no real roots. Contradiction. Therefore, d=1 case is invalid.\n\nFor d=-1: P(x)=x⁴ +x³ -x² -x -1.\n\nCompute P(1)=1 +1 -1 -1 -1= -1.\n\nP(-1)=1 -1 -1 +1 -1= -1.\n\nAt x=0: P(0)=-1.\n\nAs x→±∞, P(x)→+∞. So it goes from -∞ to -1 at x=-∞ (wait, x⁴ dominates, so as x→-∞, P(x)→+∞). Wait, at x approaching -∞, x⁴ is positive and dominates, so P(x)→+∞. At x=0, P(0)=-1. So the polynomial must cross the x-axis at least twice. But to have four real roots, it needs to cross four times. However, between -∞ and some point, and then again. But since it's positive at both infinities and negative at x=0, it might have two real roots. But not four. Let’s check the derivative again. The derivative is 4x³ +3x² -2x -1, which as before, has roots at x=-1, (1 ±√17)/8 ≈ (1 ±4.123)/8. So approx roots at x≈0.64 and x≈-0.39. So critical points at x=-1, x≈0.64, x≈-0.39.\n\nEvaluate P(x) at these critical points.\n\nAt x=-1: P(-1)=1 -1 -1 +1 -1=-1.\n\nAt x≈0.64: compute approximate value. Let’s use x=0.5:\n\nP(0.5)=0.0625 +0.125 -0.25 -0.5 -1= -1.5625\n\nx=0.75:\n\nP(0.75)= (0.75)^4 + (0.75)^3 - (0.75)^2 -0.75 -1 ≈0.316 +0.422 -0.562 -0.75 -1 ≈-1.574\n\nAt x=1: P(1)= -1.\n\nAt x=2: P(2)=16 +8 -4 -2 -1=17>0.\n\nSo between x=1 and x=2, P goes from -1 to +17, crosses zero. Similarly, as x→-∞, P(x)→+∞, and at x=-2, P(-2)=16 -8 -4 +2 -1=5>0. So perhaps the polynomial has two real roots: one between 1 and 2, and one between -2 and -1, but since it's even degree, but the polynomial is positive at both infinities and has two minima. Wait, maybe more detailed analysis needed.\n\nBut regardless, if the polynomial has two real roots, it contradicts the assumption of four real roots. Therefore, even for d=-1, this polynomial doesn’t have four real roots. Hence, the first case (a=1,c=-1) leads to a polynomial that cannot have four real roots.\n\nNow, consider the second case: P(x)=x⁴ -x³ -x² +x +d.\n\nAgain, possible d=1 or d=-1.\n\nFor d=1: P(x)=x⁴ -x³ -x² +x +1.\n\nCompute P(1)=1 -1 -1 +1 +1=1.\n\nP(-1)=1 +1 -1 -1 +1=1.\n\nAt x=0: P(0)=1.\n\nAs x→±∞, P(x)→+∞. So similar to the previous case, it might be positive everywhere, hence no real roots. But need to check.\n\nFor d=-1: P(x)=x⁴ -x³ -x² +x -1.\n\nCompute P(1)=1 -1 -1 +1 -1=-1.\n\nP(-1)=1 +1 -1 -1 -1=-1.\n\nAt x=0: P(0)=-1.\n\nAs x→±∞, P(x)→+∞. So similar to the previous d=-1 case, might have two real roots.\n\nThus, even in these cases, the polynomial doesn't have four real roots. Hence, even after satisfying the discriminant conditions for the derivatives, the polynomial doesn't have four real roots. Therefore, there is no such polynomial with all real roots and coefficients ±1.\n\nAnother angle: Use the fact that for a polynomial with all real roots, the coefficients satisfy certain inequalities called the Newton's inequalities. These relate the elementary symmetric means. For a polynomial with all real roots, the elementary symmetric means must satisfy e_k² ≥ e_{k-1} e_{k+1} for 1 ≤ k ≤ n-1.\n\nIn our case, n=4. So for k=1,2,3.\n\nGiven the elementary symmetric sums:\n\ne1 = S = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 = -a.\n\ne2 = q = sum of products two at a time = b.\n\ne3 = sum of products three at a time = -c.\n\ne4 = product of roots = d.\n\nNewton's inequalities state:\n\n(e1/4)^2 ≥ e2/(6)\n\n(e2/6)^2 ≥ (e1/4)(e3/4)\n\n(e3/4)^2 ≥ (e2/6)(e4/1)\n\nBut since e1, e2, e3, e4 are all ±1 or related, we can plug in values.\n\nGiven that we already deduced b must be -1. So e2 = -1.\n\nAlso, e1 = -a ∈ {-1,1}, e3 = -c ∈ {-1,1}, e4 = d ∈ {-1,1}.\n\nLet’s apply Newton's inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: (e1/4)^2 ≥ e2/6 ⇒ (e1²)/16 ≥ (-1)/6 ⇒ since e1² =1, this becomes 1/16 ≥ -1/6, which is true.\n\nSecond inequality: (e2/6)^2 ≥ (e1/4)(e3/4) ⇒ (1/36) ≥ ( (-a)/4 )*( (-c)/4 ) ⇒ 1/36 ≥ (a c)/16.\n\nBut a and c can be either (1,-1) or (-1,1) as per earlier. So ac = -1 in both cases. Hence:\n\n1/36 ≥ (-1)/16 ⇒ 1/36 ≥ -1/16, which is true.\n\nThird inequality: (e3/4)^2 ≥ (e2/6)(e4/1) ⇒ (e3²)/16 ≥ (-1/6)(d).\n\nSince e3² =1, this becomes 1/16 ≥ (-d)/6.\n\nIf d=1: 1/16 ≥ -1/6 ⇒ true.\n\nIf d=-1: 1/16 ≥ 1/6 ⇒ false.\n\nThus, if d=-1, the third inequality fails. Therefore, d must be 1.\n\nThus, d=1. So the product of roots is 1.\n\nBut earlier, when we considered the case with d=1, we saw that the polynomial doesn't have four real roots. However, according to Newton's inequalities, d must be 1 for the third inequality to hold. But even then, the polynomial fails to have four real roots. Hence, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, combining all these results, there exists no quartic polynomial with coefficients ±1 and all real roots. Hence, the original statement is proven.",
