    "AcceptedAnswer": "<Here is what I found Employing the change of variables $2u =x^2$ We get $$I=\\int_0^\\infty \\cos(x^2) dx =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int^\\infty_0\\frac{\\cos(2x)}{\\sqrt{x}}\\,dx$$ $$ J=\\int_0^\\infty \\sin(x^2) dx=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int^\\infty_0\\frac{\\sin(2x)}{\\sqrt{x}}\\,dx $$ Summary: We will prove that $J\\ge 0$ and $I\\ge 0$ so that, proving that $I=J$ is equivalent to $$ \\color{blue}{0= (I+J)(I-J)=I^2 -J^2 =\\lim_{t \\to 0}I_t^2-J^2_t}$$ Where, $$I_t = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx^2}\\cos(x^2) dx~~~~\\text{and}~~~ J_t = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx^2}\\sin(x^2) dx$$ $t\\mapsto I_t$ and $t\\mapsto J_t$ are clearly continuous due to the present of the integrand factor $e^{-tx^2}$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the integrals of cos(x²) and sin(x²) from 0 to infinity are equal without actually computing their exact values. They mentioned using a change of variables or some trick. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about these integrals. They are Fresnel integrals, and I remember that their values are both sqrt(π/8), but the user wants to prove equality without using that result. So, the challenge is to find a transformation that relates the two integrals directly.\n\nWhat common techniques are there for comparing integrals? Maybe substitution. Let's think about substitution in the integral. If I let u = x², then du = 2x dx, but that might complicate things because of the square root. Alternatively, maybe a different substitution.\n\nWait, sometimes with trigonometric functions, a substitution involving a phase shift might work. For example, replacing x with something that turns cosine into sine. But how?\n\nAnother thought: the integrals from 0 to infinity of cos(x²) dx and sin(x²) dx. These are related to the Gaussian integral, but again, not directly helpful here. Maybe consider a substitution that rotates the variable in some way. Complex analysis might help, but the user wants a real method.\n\nWait, there's a trick where you consider a substitution like t = x * tanθ or something. Or maybe integrating both functions and relating them through substitution.\n\nAlternatively, think of substituting y = x in one integral and then another substitution in the other. Let me try to write both integrals:\n\nLet’s denote I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) dx and I_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx.\n\nSuppose we make a substitution in I_c. Let’s say t = x. Not helpful. Maybe t = kx? Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: consider the integral of e^{-x²}, which is known. But here we have oscillatory functions. Maybe integrating over a contour or parametric differentiation? But again, the user wants a real method.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Use a substitution in one integral to turn it into the other. Let’s try substituting x = (π/2 - y) or something. Wait, if we let x = sqrt(π/2 - y²), maybe? Not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat if we make a substitution in I_c such that x² becomes something else. Let's set t = x², so x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Then, I_c becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(t) * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Similarly, I_s becomes ∫₀^∞ sin(t) * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. So both integrals are similar but with cos(t) and sin(t) multiplied by 1/(2 sqrt(t)). But how does that help?\n\nWait, perhaps integrating from 0 to infinity, and recognizing that these are related to the Gamma function. But again, that involves computation. The user wants to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating both from 0 to infinity and using substitution on one of them. Let's see. Let's take I_c and make a substitution. For example, let u = x. Then, not helpful. Maybe u = x * e^{iπ/4}? That's a complex substitution, but maybe we can relate the integrals through a rotation in the complex plane. However, the user specified \"real methods,\" so complex analysis might not be acceptable here.\n\nWait, but maybe a substitution that effectively rotates the path. Let’s think in real variables. Suppose we let t = x² in both integrals. Then as before, I_c = 1/2 ∫₀^∞ cos(t)/sqrt(t) dt and I_s = 1/2 ∫₀^∞ sin(t)/sqrt(t) dt. If we can relate these two integrals via a substitution, maybe substituting t = s^2 or something else. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating from 0 to infinity, and using a substitution that swaps the roles of sine and cosine. For example, in the integral I_c, let’s substitute t = π/2 - x². Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, consider the substitution u = x^2, but I already tried that.\n\nWait, here's another angle. The Fresnel integrals can be related to each other through the integral of e^{i x²}, but again that's complex analysis. But perhaps we can use a substitution that combines both. For example, consider the integral of e^{i x²} from 0 to infinity, which is I_c + i I_s. If we can show that the real and imaginary parts are equal, then I_c = I_s. But how to do this without computing the actual value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a substitution in the real integral. Let’s think: if we set t = x^2, then I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(t) / (2 sqrt(t)) dt. Similarly for I_s. If we can relate these two integrals through a substitution. For example, in I_s, substitute s = t. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of integrating by parts. Let’s try integrating by parts I_c. Let u = cos(t), dv = dt/(2 sqrt(t)). Then du = -sin(t) dt, v = sqrt(t). So, I_c = [cos(t) sqrt(t)] from 0 to ∞ + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ sin(t) sqrt(t) dt. But the boundary term would be problematic as t approaches infinity. Similarly, this might not lead anywhere.\n\nWait, another thought. There is a well-known substitution in the Fresnel integral where you consider a contour integral in the complex plane, but again, real methods.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the substitution in I_c: Let u = x^2, then I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(u) / (2 sqrt(u)) du. Similarly, I_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(u) / (2 sqrt(u)) du. These integrals can be related through the substitution u = v. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, can we relate them via differentiation? Suppose we consider a parameter in the integral and differentiate with respect to it, but the original integrals don't have a parameter.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's consider the substitution x = y / sqrt(2). Then dx = dy / sqrt(2). Substitute into I_c: ∫₀^∞ cos((y^2)/2) dy / sqrt(2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, think of scaling variables.\n\nAlternatively, consider that both integrals are equal to 1/2 times the integral of t^{-1/2} cos(t) dt and similarly for sin(t). The integrals of t^{-1/2} cos(t) and t^{-1/2} sin(t) from 0 to ∞ are known to be equal, but again, this might involve gamma functions or Fourier transforms.\n\nWait, but maybe using the substitution t = s^2. Let me try that. For I_c: Let s = sqrt(t), so t = s^2, dt = 2s ds. Then, I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(s^2) * 2s / (2s) ds = ∫₀^∞ cos(s^2) ds = I_c. That just brings us back. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of integrating over a different variable. Suppose we consider the sum of the two integrals. I_c + I_s = ∫₀^∞ [cos(x²) + sin(x²)] dx. Is there a way to show this is equal to 2I_c (assuming they are equal)? But that would require I_c = I_s. But that's circular.\n\nWait, let's think of substitution in one integral that turns it into the other. Let's take I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) dx. Let’s make a substitution such that x² = π/2 - y². Then when x approaches 0, y approaches sqrt(π/2), and when x approaches infinity, y would approach imaginary, which complicates things. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let’s try substituting y = x in I_c and then some other substitution. Wait, perhaps a substitution that shifts the argument. Let’s consider x = y + a, but not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let’s consider the substitution x = tanθ. Then dx = sec²θ dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cos(tan²θ) sec²θ dθ. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider a substitution in I_c: Let u = x^2, so x = sqrt(u), dx = 1/(2 sqrt(u)) du. Then I_c = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du. Similarly for I_s. Now, these integrals resemble the real and imaginary parts of the integral of e^{i u} / sqrt(u) du from 0 to ∞. But that's again complex analysis.\n\nAlternatively, recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/2} e^{-a t} dt = sqrt(π/a). But here we have oscillatory functions. Maybe using Laplace transforms or Fourier transforms. However, that might involve computation.\n\nWait, but integrating e^{-x^2} is related to these integrals through substitution. For example, using polar coordinates. But that's for the Gaussian integral.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution in the Fresnel integral. For example, substituting t = x^2, then the integral becomes 1/2 ∫₀^∞ t^{-1/2} cos(t) dt. But I still don't see how to relate this to the sine integral without computing it.\n\nWait, perhaps integrating both I_c and I_s from 0 to infinity and using a substitution that relates the two. For example, in I_s, substitute t = π/2 - x². Let's try. Let’s set t = π/2 - x². Then when x=0, t=π/2, and as x approaches infinity, t approaches negative infinity. That complicates the limits. Not useful.\n\nAlternatively, think of a substitution that inverts the interval. For instance, let u = 1/x. Then, when x approaches 0, u approaches infinity, and vice versa. Let’s try in I_c: Substitute x = 1/u, dx = -1/u² du. Then, I_c becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(1/u²) * (1/u²) du. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider adding the two integrals. I_c + I_s = ∫₀^∞ [cos(x²) + sin(x²)] dx. But [cos(x²) + sin(x²)] = sqrt(2) sin(x² + π/4), but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe consider a substitution in one integral to make it look like the other. Suppose in I_c, we make a substitution that turns cos(x²) into sin(y²). How?\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating both I_c and I_s and relating them through a common integral. For example, consider integrating from 0 to A and then taking A to infinity. Let’s define I_c(A) = ∫₀^A cos(x²) dx and similarly I_s(A). Perhaps there's a substitution that relates I_c(A) and I_s(A).\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let’s make the substitution y = x in I_c, so nothing changes. But in I_s, let's make a substitution like x = y / sqrt(1 - y^2). No, that might not converge.\n\nAlternatively, consider substitution x = tanθ. Then, dx = sec²θ dθ, and x from 0 to ∞ becomes θ from 0 to π/2. Then I_c becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cos(tan²θ) sec²θ dθ. Similarly, I_s becomes ∫₀^{π/2} sin(tan²θ) sec²θ dθ. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach. Let’s consider writing the integrals as limits. For example, I_c = lim_{A→∞} ∫₀^A cos(x²) dx. If we can relate this to I_s via substitution in the integral from 0 to A.\n\nWait, here's a key idea. Let’s perform a substitution in the integral I_c: Let t = x. Then, I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(t²) dt. Now, consider the substitution u = t^2. Then t = sqrt(u), dt = 1/(2 sqrt(u)) du. So, I_c = 1/2 ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du. Similarly, I_s = 1/2 ∫₀^∞ sin(u)/sqrt(u) du. Now, note that the integrals ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du and ∫₀^∞ sin(u)/sqrt(u) du are known to be equal. But how to show this?\n\nWait, these integrals can be related by considering the substitution u = v^2. Let’s try. For I_c: 1/2 ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du. Let u = v^2, so du = 2v dv. Then, this becomes 1/2 ∫₀^∞ cos(v^2) * 2v / v dv = ∫₀^∞ cos(v^2) dv = I_c. That brings us back. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps integrate both I_c and I_s from 0 to ∞ and notice that they can be expressed as Gamma functions. The integral ∫₀^∞ x^{n-1} e^{-a x} dx = Γ(n)/a^n. But here we have oscillatory functions. But using the formula for Fourier transforms: ∫₀^∞ x^{ν-1} sin(a x) dx = Γ(ν) / (a^ν) sin(π ν/2), valid for 0 < ν < 1. Similarly for cosine. But in our case, ν = 1/2. So, Γ(1/2) = sqrt(π). So, ∫₀^∞ x^{-1/2} sin(a x) dx = Γ(1/2) / a^{1/2} sin(π/4) = sqrt(π)/(sqrt(a)) * sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(π/(2a)). Similarly for cosine, but cos(π/4) instead of sin(π/4). Wait, Γ(1/2) / a^{1/2} cos(π/4) = sqrt(π)/sqrt(a) * sqrt(2)/2 = same as the sine integral. Therefore, both integrals are equal. But this requires knowledge of Gamma functions and their properties, which might be considered as computing the exact value. The user wants a trick to show equality without computation.\n\nAlternatively, here's a real substitution. Let’s consider the substitution u = π/2 - x². Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let’s use substitution in the integral from 0 to A, and then take A to infinity. Let’s consider I_c(A) = ∫₀^A cos(x²) dx. Let’s perform substitution x = sqrt(π/2 - y²). Then when x = 0, y = sqrt(π/2), and when x = A, y = sqrt(π/2 - A²), which becomes imaginary for A > sqrt(π/2). This complicates the limits, so not helpful.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by contour integration but using real substitutions. Consider the integral of e^{-x²} from 0 to infinity. We know that's sqrt(π)/2. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, consider parameterizing the integral. Let’s define a function F(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(t x²) dx. Then F(1) is our I_c. Compute F(t) by substitution. Let u = x sqrt(t), so x = u/sqrt(t), dx = du/sqrt(t). Then F(t) = ∫₀^∞ cos(u²) * du/sqrt(t) = (1/sqrt(t)) I_c. But F(t) = (1/sqrt(t)) I_c. Similarly, derivative of F(t) with respect to t would be - (1/2) t^{-3/2} I_c. But on the other hand, differentiating under the integral sign, F’(t) = - ∫₀^∞ x² sin(t x²) dx. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of integrating over a parameter. Let’s consider the difference I_c - I_s = ∫₀^∞ [cos(x²) - sin(x²)] dx. If we can show this is zero. Let’s make a substitution here. Let’s set u = x^2. Then, x = sqrt(u), dx = 1/(2 sqrt(u)) du. So, the difference becomes ∫₀^∞ [cos(u) - sin(u)] / (2 sqrt(u)) du. Now, combining the integrals, we have ∫₀^∞ [cos(u) - sin(u)] / (2 sqrt(u)) du. If we can show this integral is zero.\n\nAlternatively, make a substitution in this integral. Let’s set v = u + π/4. Hmm, but integration bounds change. Alternatively, use a substitution that shifts the phase. Let’s set u = v - π/4. But when u=0, v=π/4, and the lower limit changes, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating from 0 to π/4 and from π/4 to infinity. Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea. Let’s use integration by parts on the difference integral. Let’s take ∫ [cos(u) - sin(u)] / (2 sqrt(u)) du from 0 to ∞. Let’s set w = sqrt(u), so u = w², du = 2w dw. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [cos(w²) - sin(w²)] * (1/(2 w)) * 2w dw = ∫₀^∞ [cos(w²) - sin(w²)] dw. Wait, this brings us back to the original difference I_c - I_s. So that's circular.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe there's a substitution that flips between sine and cosine. For instance, in the integral I_c, make a substitution that turns the cosine into sine. For example, use a phase shift. Cosine is sine shifted by π/2. So, cos(x²) = sin(x² + π/2). But how to relate that.\n\nAlternatively, consider substituting x = y - something. But x is integrated from 0 to infinity. Shifting the variable would change the lower limit.\n\nWait, here's a key insight. The Fresnel integrals are related to the Gaussian integral through contour integration, but using a real substitution. Let’s consider the substitution x = y. Wait, that's trivial. Alternatively, consider integrating both I_c and I_s and then adding them. Let’s consider I_c + i I_s = ∫₀^∞ e^{i x²} dx. This is a standard contour integral which can be evaluated by rotating the contour to the real axis. But again, this is complex analysis. The user wants real methods.\n\nBut maybe we can relate I_c and I_s by a substitution in this complex integral, but stay within real substitutions. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps consider the following substitution in I_c: Let x = sqrt(π/2 - y²). Then dx = (-y)/sqrt(π/2 - y²) dy. But when x goes from 0 to infinity, y would go from sqrt(π/2) to imaginary numbers, which complicates the integral. Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: use the substitution t = x^2 in both integrals, leading to integrals involving cos(t)/sqrt(t) and sin(t)/sqrt(t). Then, note that integrating from 0 to infinity, these can be related through the substitution t = s. Not helpful. Wait, but maybe use a substitution that swaps cosine and sine. For example, if we substitute s = t + π/2, but then the limits become shifted. Let’s try: In I_c, substitute s = t + π/2. Then when t=0, s=π/2, and as t approaches infinity, s approaches infinity. The integral becomes ∫_{π/2}^∞ cos(s - π/2)/sqrt(s - π/2) ds. But cos(s - π/2) = sin(s), so I_c becomes ∫_{π/2}^∞ sin(s)/sqrt(s - π/2) ds. Compare this to I_s, which is ∫₀^∞ sin(s)/sqrt(s) ds. Not obviously equal. But maybe if we can find a substitution that relates these two integrals.\n\nAlternatively, make another substitution in the transformed I_c. Let u = s - π/2, then s = u + π/2, and the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ sin(u + π/2)/sqrt(u) du. But sin(u + π/2) = cos(u), so this becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du. Which is 2 I_c. Wait, but that's the same as the original substitution! So, this shows that I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(t)/sqrt(t) dt /2, and after substitution, it becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du /2 = I_c. Not helpful.\n\nWait, but this implies that 2 I_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(u)/sqrt(u) du, and similarly for I_s. So, the difference between 2 I_c and 2 I_s is ∫₀^∞ [cos(u) - sin(u)]/sqrt(u) du. If we can show this integral is zero. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let’s consider the substitution u = v^2. Then, du = 2v dv. So, ∫₀^∞ [cos(v²) - sin(v²)] * 2v dv. Wait, this becomes 2 ∫₀^∞ v [cos(v²) - sin(v²)] dv. Which is 2 [ ∫₀^∞ v cos(v²) dv - ∫₀^∞ v sin(v²) dv ]. Let’s compute these integrals. Let’s set w = v², so dw = 2v dv. Then, ∫ v cos(v²) dv = 1/2 ∫ cos(w) dw = 1/2 sin(w) + C. Evaluated from 0 to ∞, it's 1/2 [sin(∞) - sin(0)] which does not converge. Similarly for the sine term. So, this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Let's recall the original problem: the user wants to show by inspection, via change of variables or some trick, that the two integrals are equal without computing their exact values.\n\nWait, perhaps using the substitution in one integral and then relating it to the other. Let’s take I_c and make a substitution x = y / (something). Let’s consider substituting x = y / sqrt(2). Then dx = dy / sqrt(2). Then, I_c becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(y² / 2) / sqrt(2) dy. Similarly, if we take I_s and make a substitution x = y / sqrt(2), then I_s becomes ∫₀^∞ sin(y² / 2) / sqrt(2) dy. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach. Consider the integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = sqrt(π)/2. If we can relate the Fresnel integrals to this. But they involve oscillatory functions instead of decaying exponentials.\n\nAlternatively, consider integrating e^{i x²} from 0 to ∞. The real part is I_c and the imaginary part is I_s. If we can show that the real and imaginary parts are equal, then I_c = I_s. To evaluate this contour integral, we can rotate the contour by 45 degrees. Let’s let z = x e^{i π/4}, so dz = e^{i π/4} dx. Then, the integral becomes e^{i π/4} ∫₀^∞ e^{-z²} dz = e^{i π/4} sqrt(π)/2. Therefore, I_c + i I_s = e^{i π/4} sqrt(π)/2 = sqrt(π)/2 (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) = sqrt(π)/2 (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(π)/2 * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) = sqrt(π)/(2 sqrt(2)) (1 + i). Therefore, equating real and imaginary parts, I_c = I_s = sqrt(π)/(2 sqrt(2)) = sqrt(π/8). But this uses complex analysis, which the user might not want.\n\nThe user specified \"real methods,\" so this complex substitution might not be acceptable. But maybe we can mimic this rotation in real variables. For example, make a substitution in the real integral that effectively performs the same rotation. Let’s try substituting t = x e^{i π/4} but in real terms. However, this leads to complex variables, which is what we wanted to avoid.\n\nWait, perhaps use a substitution in the real integral that combines both sine and cosine. For example, consider integrating from 0 to R, then substituting x = R - y or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following substitution in I_c: Let y = x. Then, not helpful. Wait, another idea: Since cos(x²) and sin(x²) are related through differentiation. The derivative of sin(x²) is 2x cos(x²), but integrating over x complicates things.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. The key idea in the complex analysis approach is that the integrals are components of a complex integral which can be evaluated via a contour rotation. To mimic this without complex numbers, perhaps use a substitution that effectively \"rotates\" the variable. Let’s try substituting x = t / sqrt(1 + t^2). No, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution x = sqrt(tanθ). Then x² = tanθ, and dx = (1/(2 sqrt(tanθ)) ) sec²θ dθ. So, I_c becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cos(tanθ) * (1/(2 sqrt(tanθ)) ) sec²θ dθ. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a clever substitution that I’m missing. Let me think of other integral identities. For example, is there a substitution that transforms cos(x²) into sin(y²)? \n\nWait, here's a trick: Consider the substitution y = x. Then, obviously, it doesn't change. But if I can find a substitution that when applied to I_c gives I_s. For example, if there's a substitution such that x² = y² + π/2. Let’s set y = sqrt(x² - π/2). But then x >= sqrt(π/2), and the lower limit becomes sqrt(π/2). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, split the integral into two parts. For example, write I_c = ∫₀^{sqrt(π/2)} cos(x²) dx + ∫_{sqrt(π/2)}^∞ cos(x²) dx. Then, in the second integral, make a substitution u = x² - π/2. Then, x² = u + π/2, x = sqrt(u + π/2), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(u + π/2))) du. The second integral becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(u + π/2) * (1/(2 sqrt(u + π/2))) du = - ∫₀^∞ sin(u) * (1/(2 sqrt(u + π/2))) du. Not sure if this helps. Compare to I_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx. Doesn't seem directly related.\n\nAlternatively, notice that if we integrate from 0 to A, and make a substitution that flips the integral to A to infinity. For example, in ∫₀^A cos(x²) dx, substitute x = A - y. Then dx = -dy. Limits from y = A to y = 0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by symmetry. If we can show that the integral from 0 to sqrt(π/2) of cos(x²) dx equals the integral from sqrt(π/2) to infinity of sin(x²) dx, and vice versa. But how?\n\nLet’s denote the integral from 0 to sqrt(π/2) as I_1 and from sqrt(π/2) to infinity as I_2. So I_c = I_1 + I_2. Similarly, I_s = ∫₀^{sqrt(π/2)} sin(x²) dx + ∫_{sqrt(π/2)}^∞ sin(x²) dx = J_1 + J_2. If we can show that I_1 = J_2 and I_2 = J_1, then I_c = J_2 + J_1 = J_1 + J_2 = I_s. But how to establish this?\n\nLet’s try a substitution in I_2. Let’s set y = x² - π/2. Then x = sqrt(y + π/2), dx = 1/(2 sqrt(y + π/2)) dy. When x = sqrt(π/2), y=0, and x approaches infinity, y approaches infinity. Then, I_2 = ∫₀^∞ cos(y + π/2) * (1/(2 sqrt(y + π/2))) dy = - ∫₀^∞ sin(y) * (1/(2 sqrt(y + π/2))) dy. Compare to J_2 = ∫_{sqrt(π/2)}^∞ sin(x²) dx. Let’s make a substitution in J_2: Let z = x² - π/2. Then x = sqrt(z + π/2), dx = 1/(2 sqrt(z + π/2)) dz. So J_2 = ∫₀^∞ sin(z + π/2) * (1/(2 sqrt(z + π/2))) dz = ∫₀^∞ cos(z) * (1/(2 sqrt(z + π/2))) dz. Comparing I_2 and J_2, they are related but not equal. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, consider a substitution in I_1. Let’s set t = sqrt(π/2 - x²). Then x = sqrt(π/2 - t²), dx = - t / sqrt(π/2 - t²) dt. When x=0, t= sqrt(π/2); when x=sqrt(π/2), t=0. So, I_1 becomes ∫_{sqrt(π/2)}^0 cos(π/2 - t²) * (-t / sqrt(π/2 - t²)) dt = ∫₀^{sqrt(π/2)} cos(π/2 - t²) * (t / sqrt(π/2 - t²)) dt. But cos(π/2 - t²) = sin(t²). So, I_1 = ∫₀^{sqrt(π/2)} sin(t²) * (t / sqrt(π/2 - t²)) dt. This doesn't directly relate to J_1 or J_2. Not helpful.\n\nThis is getting quite involved, and I’m not finding a straightforward real substitution that equates I_c and I_s without computation. The user might have intended a clever substitution that I’m missing. Let me check standard references or tricks.\n\nAh! I recall that there is a substitution that relates the two integrals via a parameter. Let’s consider the substitution x = y / sqrt(1 + y²). Wait, let's try:\n\nLet’s set y = x. Not helpful. Alternatively, set y = tanθ. Then x = sqrt(tanθ). But this leads back to previous issues.\n\nWait, another idea. Let's consider the substitution x = t in I_c and x = π/(2t) in I_s. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, here's a trick used in some integral proofs: use a substitution in one integral that mirrors the other. For instance, in I_c, set t = x^2, leading to (1/2) ∫₀^∞ cos(t)/sqrt(t) dt. In I_s, set t = x^2, leading to (1/2) ∫₀^∞ sin(t)/sqrt(t) dt. Now, note that ∫₀^∞ cos(t)/sqrt(t) dt = ∫₀^∞ sin(t)/sqrt(t) dt. This equality can be shown via substitution t = u. Wait, but how?\n\nBut if I make a substitution in the cosine integral: Let u = π/2 - t. Then when t=0, u=π/2, and as t→∞, u approaches -infty, which isn’t valid. So not helpful.\n\nWait, but recall that ∫₀^∞ cos(t)/sqrt(t) dt = ∫₀^∞ sin(t)/sqrt(t) dt. This is a known result from the Fresnel integrals. But to show this without computation, perhaps using a substitution.\n\nConsider the integral ∫₀^∞ [cos(t) - sin(t)] / sqrt(t) dt. If we can show this is zero, then the two integrals are equal. Let’s make a substitution t = u^2, so dt = 2u du. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [cos(u²) - sin(u²)] 2u / u du = 2 ∫₀^∞ [cos(u²) - sin(u²)] du = 2(I_c - I_s). So, if the original integral is zero, then I_c = I_s. But how to show the original integral is zero without computation?\n\nAlternatively, integrate [cos(t) - sin(t)] / sqrt(t) from 0 to ∞. Let’s split the integral into two parts: from 0 to π/4 and from π/4 to ∞. In the first part, make a substitution u = π/2 - t. Then when t=0, u=π/2; when t=π/4, u=π/4. So, the integral becomes ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} [cos(π/2 - u) - sin(π/2 - u)] / sqrt(π/2 - u) (-du). Which simplifies to ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} [sin(u) - cos(u)] / sqrt(π/2 - u) du. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider pairing each t with π/2 - t. Let’s set u = π/2 - t. Then, when t=0, u=π/2; when t=π/2, u=0. So, ∫₀^{π/2} [cos(t) - sin(t)] / sqrt(t) dt + ∫_{π/2}^∞ [cos(t) - sin(t)] / sqrt(t) dt. The first integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} [cos(t) - sin(t)] / sqrt(t) dt. The second, after substituting u = t - π/2, becomes ∫₀^∞ [cos(u + π/2) - sin(u + π/2)] / sqrt(u + π/2) du. Which is ∫₀^∞ [-sin(u) - cos(u)] / sqrt(u + π/2) du. Not helpful.\n\nThis is proving to be quite challenging. Perhaps the answer is that there isn't a straightforward real substitution to show the equality without computation, and the user's exam question was expecting the complex method or recognition of the Gamma function relation. However, the user insists on real methods.\n\nWait, here's a last-ditch idea. Consider integrating both I_c and I_s over the same interval and using a substitution that relates them. Let’s define a parameterized integral F(a) = ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) e^{-a x} dx. Then, F(0) = I_c. Similarly for sine. But differentiating under the integral sign might relate them. However, this seems computational.\n\nAlternatively, think of the integrals as part of a differential equation. Let’s set I = I_c and J = I_s. If we can find a relation between I and J via differentiation or other means. For example, dI/da = -∫₀^∞ x sin(x²) e^{-a x} dx. Not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe the intended trick is to use the substitution t = x^2 in both integrals, leading to expressions involving cos(t)/sqrt(t) and sin(t)/sqrt(t), and then observe that these integrals are equal by a symmetry in their evaluations, even though that symmetry isn't obvious without Gamma function knowledge. But since the user wants to avoid computation, perhaps there's no real method and the equality is shown via complex analysis, which is the standard approach.\n\nHowever, the user explicitly mentioned \"real methods\" in the reference to another question. The answer might involve integrating both functions over a common domain and using a substitution that flips between them. For example, in the linked question, they use substitution x = \\sqrt{\\pi/2} - y or similar. Wait, let me check the linked question.\n\nThe user linked: \"Evaluating ∫₀^∞ sin x² dx with real methods?\" which might have an answer using real methods. Let me recall. In that answer, they use substitution and integration by parts.\n\nOne method from there is to write sin(x²) as an integral and swap the order of integration. For example, sin(x²) = ∫₀^x cos(x² - t²) * 2x dt. Then, integrating over x and swapping. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the substitution x = t^{-1/2} in the integrals after transforming with t = x^2. This might lead to a relation between the integrals.\n\nAlternatively, let’s consider the substitution t = u in I_c and t = u + π/2 in I_s. Not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a real substitution, I think the answer might involve recognizing that both integrals are equal due to their evaluation via the same method (like in the Gamma function), but without computation, it's challenging. However, the problem states to show equality by inspection via a change of variables. Therefore, the intended answer is likely a substitution that transforms one integral into the other.\n\nAfter reviewing, I think the correct substitution is to use x = sqrt(π/2 - y^2) or similar, but I'm not getting it. Wait, perhaps substituting x = y / sqrt(1 - y^2) for one of the integrals. No, bounds become problematic.\n\nWait, here's a key insight from real analysis. The integrals I_c and I_s can be shown equal by considering the substitution x = \\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y. Let’s try:\n\nIn I_c, substitute x = \\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y. Then dx = - \\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y² dy. When x approaches 0, y approaches infinity; when x approaches infinity, y approaches 0. Thus, I_c becomes ∫_∞^0 cos( (\\sqrt{\\pi/2}/y)^2 ) * (- \\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy = ∫₀^∞ cos( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy.\n\nSimilarly, consider the integral I_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx. Substitute x = \\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y, then I_s becomes ∫₀^∞ sin( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy.\n\nNow, compare the transformed I_c and I_s. They are:\n\nI_c_transformed = ∫₀^∞ cos( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy\n\nI_s_transformed = ∫₀^∞ sin( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy\n\nBut we also have the original integrals:\n\nI_c = ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) dx\n\nI_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx\n\nIf we add I_c and I_c_transformed:\n\nI_c + I_c_transformed = ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) dx + ∫₀^∞ cos( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy\n\nBut changing variable y to x in the second integral (y = x), it becomes ∫₀^∞ cos( π/(2 x²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / x²) dx\n\nSimilarly, if we add I_s and I_s_transformed, we get:\n\nI_s + I_s_transformed = ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx + ∫₀^∞ sin( π/(2 x²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / x²) dx\n\nBut it's unclear how this helps. However, notice that if we set z = sqrt(π/2)/x, then x = sqrt(π/2)/z, dx = - sqrt(pi/2)/z² dz. So, the integral I_c_transformed becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(z²) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / (sqrt(pi/2)/z)²) * (sqrt(pi/2)/z²) dz. Wait, this is getting messy. Let me compute it properly.\n\nLet’s compute I_c_transformed:\n\nLet x = sqrt(π/2)/y ⇒ y = sqrt(π/2)/x ⇒ dy = - sqrt(π/2)/x² dx\n\nSo, I_c_transformed = ∫₀^∞ cos( π/(2 y²) ) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / y²) dy\n\nLet’s substitute y = sqrt(π/2)/x. Then when y → 0, x → ∞; y → ∞, x → 0.\n\nSo, dy = sqrt(π/2) (-1/x²) dx\n\nThus, I_c_transformed becomes ∫₀^∞ cos(x²) * (\\sqrt{\\pi/2} / ( (sqrt(pi/2)/x )² )) * ( sqrt(pi/2)/x² ) dx\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nDenominator y² is (sqrt(pi/2)/x)^2 = pi/(2 x²)\n\nThus, the integrand becomes cos(x²) * [ sqrt(pi/2) / (pi/(2 x²)) ) ] * ( sqrt(pi/2)/x² ) dx\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nsqrt(pi/2) divided by (pi/(2 x²)) is sqrt(pi/2) * 2 x² / pi = (2 x² / sqrt(pi/2)) ) / pi = (2 x²) / (pi) * sqrt(2/pi)) = (2 x² sqrt(2)) / (pi sqrt(pi)) )\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that after substitution, the transformed integral I_c_transformed is equal to I_s. \n\nWait, let's compute the integrand of I_c_transformed:\n\ncos(pi/(2 y²)) * (sqrt(pi/2)/y²)\n\nLet’s set z = y. Then, if we set z = sqrt(pi/(2 t)), then t = pi/(2 z²), dt = -pi/(2 z³) dz. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integrand cos(pi/(2 y²)) / y². Let’s set u = pi/(2 y²). Then y = sqrt(pi/(2 u)), dy = - sqrt(pi/2) / (2 u^(3/2)) du. Then, the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ cos(u) * (sqrt(pi/2)/ (pi/(2 u)) ) * ( sqrt(pi/2) / (2 u^(3/2)) ) du\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps the key realization is that after substitution, I_c_transformed equals I_s, and since the original I_c equals I_c_transformed (due to substitution), then I_c = I_s. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, after substitution, I_c becomes I_s. Let’s see:\n\nIn I_c, after substitution x = sqrt(pi/2)/y,\n\nI_c = ∫₀^∞ cos( (sqrt(pi/2)/y )² ) * (sqrt(pi/2)/y²) dy\n\n= ∫₀^∞ cos( pi/(2 y²) ) * (sqrt(pi/2)/y²) dy\n\nNow, let’s make a substitution in I_s:\n\nI_s = ∫₀^∞ sin(z²) dz\n\nLet’s set z = sqrt(pi/2)/w. Then dz = - sqrt(pi/2)/w² dw\n\nI_s = ∫₀^∞ sin( (sqrt(pi/2)/w)^2 ) * (sqrt(pi/2)/w²) dw\n\n= ∫₀^∞ sin( pi/(2 w²) ) * (sqrt(pi/2)/w²) dw\n\nWhich is the same as the transformed I_c:\n\nI_c_transformed = ∫₀^∞ cos( pi/(2 w²) ) * (sqrt(pi/2)/w²) dw\n\nWait, but it's cos versus sin. So unless there’s a phase shift, they aren’t the same. Therefore, this approach doesn’t equate I_c and I_s.\n\nThis seems to be a dead end. Given the time I’ve spent and not finding a real substitution, I think the intended answer is the substitution that rotates the contour in the complex plane, but framed in real variables. Even though it's complex analysis, the key substitution is x = y e^{i π/4}, which turns the integral into the Gaussian integral. However, since the user wants real methods, this might not be acceptable. But perhaps the problem allows this substitution as a \"trick\" even though it uses complex numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is to recognize that both integrals are equal by symmetry without computation, but that’s not helpful.\n\nGiven th",
