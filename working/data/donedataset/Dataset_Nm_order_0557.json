    "AcceptedAnswer": "I tried substitutions and the differentiation w.r.t a paramater trick like the other posters. Another partial result, or a trail of breadcrumbs to follow, is the following. We try a series expansion,\n$$\n\\frac{\\log\\left(1-x^4\\right)}{1+x^2} = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x^{4k}\\left(x^{2} -1\\right)H_k,\n$$\nwhere $H_k$ are the Harmonic numbers.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Evaluating $\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log x \\log \\left(1-x^4 \\right)}{1+x^2}dx$\". The user is trying to prove that this integral equals $\\frac{\\pi^{3}}{16} - 3\\mathrm{G}\\log(2)$, where $\\mathrm{G}$ is Catalan's Constant. They mention they expressed it in terms of Euler Sums but that hasn't helped, and they provided an expression involving the polygamma function $\\psi_{1}(z)$. They want help solving the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The format requires each assumption to be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's see. The integral is from 0 to 1, so the limits are 0 and 1. The integrand is $\\frac{\\log x \\log (1 - x^4)}{1 + x^2}$. The problem is to evaluate this integral and show it's equal to the given expression involving π³ and Catalan's constant.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions were about the variables involved. Here, the integral is definite, so the variables are integrated out. The main objects here are the functions involved. The assumptions would be about the domain of integration and the functions being integrated. However, since it's a definite integral, the main assumptions are the limits of integration and the integrand's form. Also, the user didn't mention any specific conditions on x, other than being in [0,1]. But in the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the integral is over real numbers from 0 to 1, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log x \\log (1 - x^4)}{1 + x^2}$.\n\nBut wait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. In this problem, maybe the assumptions are about the functions being integrated? For example, log x is defined for x > 0, which is satisfied here since the integral is from 0 to 1, but x=0 is a limit. But maybe the key assumptions are the structure of the integrand. However, the problem is to evaluate the integral, so perhaps the main assumption is the integral expression itself. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it was part of the problem's requirement. Wait, no, the example seems to have altered the original problem. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but that seems like the user modified the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, no, perhaps the example is showing a different problem. Wait, maybe the original problem had an error, and the formatted problem corrected it. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see.\n\nWait, the example says \"Original problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem under Assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. So this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or maybe it's a mistake. Hmm. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the original problem actually did require n divisible by 7, but the user wrote it incorrectly. Hmm. This could be a problem because if the example is incorrect, I might misinterpret the instructions.\n\nWait, the user says: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So in the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in this case, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't present in the original problem. That suggests that the user is using the assumption section to list the conditions given in the problem. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, which is an assumption. But the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the example to have an original problem where divisibility by 7 is a condition, but mistakenly presented a different original problem. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the formatting process is to extract all the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n,\" which is an assumption, but then the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" That doesn't make sense. Unless perhaps the user intended to create a modified problem for the example. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that, maybe the user wants me to extract all the conditions that are given in the problem. So in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, the integrand is as given, and the task is to evaluate it. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is (log x log(1 - x^4))/(1 + x^2).\n\nBut in the example, they broke down each assumption into separate lines. So each line is a single condition. Here, the integral's limits are 0 and 1, which is one assumption. The integrand's form is another. But maybe also the functions involved: log x is defined on (0,1], log(1 - x^4) is defined for x in [0,1) since at x=1, 1 - x^4=0, but the integral is up to 1. However, these might be considered part of the problem's setup rather than explicit assumptions. The problem is to evaluate the integral, so the main assumptions are the integral's definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral itself. But according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, for the integral problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1].\n- The integrand is $\\frac{\\log x \\log(1 - x^4)}{1 + x^2}$.\n\nBut maybe also:\n\n- x is a real variable.\n- log denotes the natural logarithm.\n\nBut the example didn't mention those. In the example, it was about n being an integer. So perhaps for the integral problem, the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. Since the user didn't specify any conditions on x other than the integral's limits, which are given. So structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log x \\log(1 - x^4)}{1 + x^2}$.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the integral and show that it equals $\\frac{\\pi^{3}}{16} - 3\\mathrm{G}\\log(2)$, where $\\mathrm{G}$ is Catalan's Constant.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was rephrased to include the divisibility. So perhaps in this case, the problem statement is just as given, but structured. The user wants the problem restructured with assumptions listed and the problem statement.\n\nSo following the example, the assumptions would list each condition. The integral from 0 to1 is one assumption, the integrand's form is another. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is $\\frac{\\log x \\log(1 - x^4)}{1 + x^2}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log\\left(x\\right) \\log\\left(1 - x^{4}\\right)}{1 + x^{2}}dx = \\frac{\\pi^{3}}{16} - 3\\mathrm{G}\\log\\left(2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{G}$ is Catalan's Constant.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. The example took the original problem, extracted the conditions (even if they weren't explicitly stated as assumptions), and listed them. So here, the key elements are the integral's limits and the integrand's structure. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those as assumptions and present the integral equality as the problem to solve.",
