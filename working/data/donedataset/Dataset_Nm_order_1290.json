    "Content": "Can someone give me a clue on how am I going to prove that this pattern is true or not as I deal with repeated division by 2? I tried dividing 360 by 2 repeatedly, eventually the digits of the result, when added repeatedly, always result to 9 for example: \\begin{align*}\n360 ÷ 2 &= 180 \\text{, and } 1 + 8 + 0 = 9\\\\\n180 ÷ 2 &= 90 \\text{, and } 9 + 0 = 9\\\\\n90 ÷ 2 &= 45 \\text{, and } 4 + 5 = 9\\\\\n45 ÷ 2 &= 22.5 \\text{, and } 2 + 2 + 5 = 9\\\\\n22.5 ÷ 2 &= 11.25 \\text{, and } 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 9\\\\\n11.25 ÷ 2 &= 5.625 \\text{, and } 5 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 18 \\text{, and } 1 + 8 = 9\\\\\n5.625 ÷ 2 &= 2.8125 \\text{, and } 2 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18 \\text{, and } 1 + 8 = 9\n\\end{align*} As I continue this pattern I found no error (but not so sure)... please any idea would be of great help!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Define the digit sum of the positive integer $n$ as the sum $d(n)$ of its digits. The reduced digit sum $d^*(n)$ is obtained by iterating the computation of the digit sum. For instance $$\nn=17254,\\quad\nd(n)=1+7+2+5+4=19,\n\\quad\nd(d(n))=1+9=10,\n\\quad\nd(d(d(n)))=1+0=1=d^*(n)\n$$ Note that $d(n)\\le n$ , equality holding if and only if $1\\le n\\le 9$ . Also, $1\\le d^*(n)\\le 9$ , because the process stops only when the digit sum obtained is a one-digit number. The main point is that $n-d(n)$ is divisible by $9$ : indeed, if $$\nn=a_0+a_1\\cdot10+a_2\\cdot10^2+\\dots+a_n\\cdot10^n,\n$$ then $$\nn-d(n)=a_0(1-1)+a_1(10-1)+a_2(10^2-1)+\\dots+a_n(10^n-1)\n$$ and each factor $10^k-1$ is divisible by $9$ . This extends to the reduced digit sum, because we can write (in the example above) $$\nn-d^*(n)=\\bigl(n-d(n)\\bigr)+\\bigl(d(n)-d(d(n))\\bigr)+\\bigl(d(d(n))-d(d(d(n)))\\bigr)\n$$ and each parenthesized term is divisible by $9$ . This works the same when a different number of steps is necessary. Since the only one-digit number divisible by $9$ is $9$ itself, we can conclude that $d^*(n)=9$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $9$ . Since $360$ is divisible by $9$ , its reduced digit sum is $9$ ; the same happenso for $180$ and so on. When you divide an even integer $n$ by $2$ , the quotient is divisible by $9$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $9$ . What if the integer $n$ is odd? Well, the digits sum of $10n$ is the same as the digit sum of $n$ . So what you are actually doing when arriving at $45$ is actually \\begin{align}\n&45 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot10} 450 \\xrightarrow{/2} 225 && d^*(225)=9 \\\\\n&225 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot10} 2250 \\xrightarrow{/2} 1225 && d^*(1225)=9\n\\end{align} and so on. Note that the first step can also be stated as $$\n45 \\xrightarrow{\\cdot5} 225\n$$ Under these operations divisibility by $9$ is preserved, because you divide by $2$ or multiply by $5$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, and then the problem is restated.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is about repeatedly dividing 360 by 2 and preserving that the sum of digits (including decimals) is 9. The user did several divisions by 2 and each time, after adding the digits (even with decimals), the sum reduces to 9. They want to know if this pattern is true or not and are asking for a clue.\n\nNow, the task is to filter out unrelated information and structure it into Assumption and Problem sections. The example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So, assumptions are the given conditions or properties that the problem states.\n\nLooking at the problem here: the main object is 360 being divided by 2 repeatedly. The key conditions are that each division by 2 results in a number whose digits (including decimals) sum to 9 when summed repeatedly (i.e., digital root). But the problem is asking whether this pattern holds true always or not. \n\nSo, the assumptions would include the starting number (360), the operation (repeated division by 2), and the specific condition about the sum of digits including decimals. However, in the example, assumptions were more about the variables involved. Here, the assumptions might be:\n\n- The initial number is 360.\n- The operation is repeated division by 2.\n- After each division, the digits of the result (including decimal parts) are summed.\n- The sum of the digits is repeatedly summed until a single digit is obtained.\n- The problem checks if this final single digit is always 9.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial number is 360.\n- Each step involves dividing the previous result by 2.\n- The digits of the result, including decimal digits, are summed.\n- The summation of digits is repeated until a single digit is obtained.\n- The problem checks if each such single digit is 9.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking whether this pattern is true or not. So the problem is to prove or disprove that repeatedly dividing 360 by 2 and summing the digits (including decimals) as described always results in 9.\n\nBut the example's assumption included specific conditions on the variables. Here, maybe the key assumptions are about the process: starting with 360, dividing by 2 each time, considering decimal digits when summing, and the digital root being 9 each time. However, the problem is whether this pattern holds. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Start with 360.\n- Repeatedly divide by 2.\n- After each division, compute the sum of all digits (including decimals).\n- Repeat summing the digits of the result until a single digit is obtained.\n- Check if this single digit is always 9.\n\nBut since the problem is to verify if this is always the case, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is the question. The example had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user didn't state those; the example's formatted problem added those assumptions. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So maybe the example shows that the assumptions are derived from the problem statement, possibly correcting or clarifying.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". The formatted problem changed it to \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\" and problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91. Wait, but 91 is 13*7. So maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected the assumptions. Wait, but actually, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that perhaps the answerer noticed that the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the user's original problem was incorrect, and the formatted problem corrected the assumptions. But in the case here, the problem is as stated by the user: they observe a pattern and want to know if it's true or not.\n\nBut for the current problem, the user is asking to structure the problem into assumptions and problem. The original problem is about dividing 360 by 2 repeatedly and each time the sum of digits (including decimals) reduces to 9. So the assumptions would be the initial number (360), the operation (divide by 2 each time), the process of summing digits including decimals, and then taking the digital root (sum until single digit). The problem is to prove or disprove that this digital root is always 9.\n\nBut the example shows that assumptions are specific conditions. So let's structure it:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial number is 360.\n- Each subsequent number is obtained by dividing the previous number by 2.\n- The sum of all digits (including decimal digits) is calculated for each result.\n- The summation is repeated until a single digit is obtained.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that the single-digit sum obtained after each division by 2 is always 9.\n\nBut wait, the example's assumption didn't include the process steps, but more about the variables. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The starting number is 360.\n- Each step involves division by 2.\n- Decimal digits are included when summing.\n- The sum of digits is reduced to a single digit by repeated summation.\n\nProblem: Prove that this single digit is always 9.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more procedural. But following the format, perhaps each assumption is a condition. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- Start with 360.\n- Repeatedly divide by 2.\n- Include decimal digits when summing digits.\n- Sum digits until a single digit is obtained.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the resulting single digit is always 9.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were more about the variables, not the process. However, since the current problem is about a process, maybe the assumptions are about the steps involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply the question as stated, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem changed it to assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps the answerer noticed that the original problem had a mistake and corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7. But in this case, the user hasn't made a mistake but is asking whether the pattern holds. Therefore, the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem, which are:\n\n- Starting with 360.\n- Dividing by 2 repeatedly.\n- Summing the digits, including decimal digits.\n- Repeating the summation until a single digit is obtained.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial number is 360.\n- Each subsequent number is obtained by dividing the previous number by 2.\n- The digits of the result include decimal digits.\n- The digits of each result are summed.\n- The summation is repeated until a single digit is obtained.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that each single-digit sum is 9.\n\nBut the original question's title mentions \"sum of the digits (including decimals) is 9\", so perhaps the problem is to prove that this holds true for every division by 2 step. The example in the original problem had a math formula and assumptions about n; here, the problem is more procedural. However, following the format, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one condition or property of one object.\n\nLet me try:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial number is 360.\n- Each step involves dividing the current number by 2.\n- The result of each division includes decimal digits.\n- The sum of all digits (integer and decimal parts) is computed.\n- The summation of digits is repeated until a single digit is obtained.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the final single digit is always 9.\n\nBut the original problem's user is asking if this pattern is true or not, so the problem is to determine whether the assertion holds. However, in the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that...\". In this case, the problem is to \"prove that this pattern is true or not\". But the example's problem was phrased as \"Prove that...\", so perhaps here it's better to phrase it as \"Prove or disprove that...\".\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe initial number is 360,\nEach step divides the current number by 2,\nDecimal digits are included in the digit sum,\nThe digit sum is repeatedly summed until a single digit is obtained.\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the final single digit is always 9.",
