    "Content": "Let $X$ be a continuous non-negative random variable (i.e. $R_x$ has only non-negative values). Prove that $$E(X) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(X>x)\\,dx  = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1-F_X(x))\\,dx$$ where $F_X(x)$ is the CDF for $X$. Using this result, find $E(X)$ for an exponential ($\\lambda$) random variable. I know that by definition, $F_X(x) = P(X \\leq x)$ and so $1 - F_X(x) = P(X>x)$ The solution is:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{x}^{\\infty} f(y)\\,dy dx   \n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{y} f(y)\\,dy dx \n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} yf(y) dy.$$ I'm really confused as to where the double integral came from. I'm also rusty on multivariate calc, so I'm confused about the swapping of $x$ and $\\infty$ to $0$ and $y$. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Observe that for a continuous random variable, (well absolutely continuous to be rigorous): $$\\mathsf P(X> x) = \\int_x^\\infty f_X(y)\\operatorname d y$$ Then taking the definite integral (if we can): $$\\int_0^\\infty \\mathsf P(X> x)\\operatorname d x = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_x^\\infty f_X(y)\\operatorname d y\\operatorname d x$$ To swap the order of integration we use Tonelli's Theorem , since a probability density is strictly non-negative. Observe that we are integrating over the domain where $0< x< \\infty$ and $x< y< \\infty$, which is to say $0<y<\\infty$ and $0< x < y$. $$\\begin{align}\\int_0^\\infty \\mathsf P(X> x)\\operatorname d x = & ~ \\iint_{0< x< y< \\infty} f_X(y)\\operatorname d (x,y)\n\\\\[1ex] = & ~ \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^y f_X(y)\\operatorname d x\\operatorname d y\\end{align}$$ Then since $\\int_0^y f_X(y)\\operatorname d x = f_X(y) \\int_0^y 1\\operatorname d x = y~f_X(y)$ we have: $$\\begin{align}\\int_0^\\infty \\mathsf P(X> x)\\operatorname d x = & ~ \\int_0^\\infty y ~ f_X(y)\\operatorname d y \\\\[1ex] = & ~ \\mathsf E(X \\mid X\\geq 0)~\\mathsf P(X\\geq 0) \\\\[1ex] = & ~ \\mathsf E(X) & \\textsf{when $X$ is strictly positive} \\end{align}$$ $\\mathcal {QED}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user wants to prove that for a continuous non-negative random variable X, the expectation E(X) is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of P(X > x) dx, which is also equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of 1 - F_X(x) dx, where F_X is the CDF. Then, using this result, they need to find E(X) for an exponential random variable with parameter λ.\n\nThe user also mentions their confusion about the double integral in the solution provided. They don't understand where the double integral comes from and how the limits of integration are swapped. However, the task here is to format the problem, not to address the confusion.\n\nFirst, listing the assumptions. The problem states that X is a continuous non-negative random variable. So, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. X is a random variable.\n2. X is continuous.\n3. X is non-negative (i.e., its range R_x consists of non-negative values).\n\nEach assumption should be on a separate line, each addressing one property of a single object (X in this case). So the assumptions are straightforward here.\n\nNext, the problem itself. The main problem has two parts: first to prove the equality of E(X) with the two integrals, and second to apply this result to find E(X) for an exponential random variable. However, in the example provided, sometimes the problem is split into parts, but here the user might want to include both parts in the problem statement. But looking at the example given in the original query, the problem was restated concisely. So, the problem here is: Prove that E(X) equals the integral of P(X > x) dx from 0 to infinity, which equals the integral of 1 - F_X(x) dx from 0 to infinity, and then find E(X) for an exponential(λ) random variable.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem mentioned \"using this result, find E(X)...\". So perhaps the problem statement here includes both proving the equality and then applying it. But the user's formatted example for the divisibility problem included only the problem statement as given. So I need to see how the original problem was presented. The original problem says: \"Prove that E(X) = ... = ... Using this result, find E(X) for an exponential (λ) random variable.\"\n\nSo in the Problem section, it should include both parts: proving the equality and then applying it. However, the example given by the user in the instruction included a problem that was split into assumptions and problem. So perhaps the problem statement here would be as written: \"Prove that E(X) = ∫₀^∞ P(X > x) dx = ∫₀^∞ (1 - F_X(x)) dx. Using this result, find E(X) for an exponential (λ) random variable.\"\n\nBut the user might have structured their example by including only the main problem and any specific assumptions. Wait, in the example provided, the original problem was about proving divisibility by 91, but in the formatted version, an assumption was added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, looking at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem's assumptions included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, in the example, the user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example. Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Perhaps that example is incorrect. But regardless, the user wants us to filter the problem and structure it with the correct assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question states that X is a continuous non-negative random variable. So the assumptions are:\n\n- X is a random variable.\n\n- X is continuous.\n\n- X is non-negative (i.e., R_x has only non-negative values).\n\nEach of these is a separate line.\n\nThe problem is to prove the equality and then apply it to the exponential case. So the problem statement would be as written.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: \nX is a random variable,\nX is continuous,\nX is non-negative.\nProblem:\nProve that $$E(X) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} P(X > x)\\,dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (1 - F_X(x))\\,dx$$ where $F_X(x)$ is the CDF for $X$. Using this result, find $E(X)$ for an exponential ($\\lambda$) random variable.\n\nYes, that seems to capture the problem. The key is to ensure that all assumptions are listed individually, and the problem is stated concisely. The user's confusion about the double integral and the swapping of limits is part of their question but not part of the problem statement itself. The task is to structure the problem, not the user's confusion.",
