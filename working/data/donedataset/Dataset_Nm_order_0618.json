    "Content": "Prove or disprove that an equation involving one trig function (either $\\sin,\\cos,\\tan$, etc) with an argument of the form $ax+b$ for non-zero rational $a,b$  and a polynomial with non-zero rational coefficients and a constant term not equal to $\\pm1$ or zero is not solvable in closed form.  For example, $$\\sin(x)=2-x-x^2$$ It has solutions near $x=0.752$ and $x=-2.242$ My reasoning for why there is no closed form solution is because If $x$ is a rational multiple of $\\pi$, the LHS is algebraic, while the RHS is transcendental. If $x$ is of the form $x=\\arcsin(u)\\ne\\frac ab\\pi$ and $u$ is algebraic, then  the LHS is algebraic but the RHS... is not algebraic?  See When is ArcTan a rational multiple of pi? for some information. If $x$ is none of the above, I don't think there exists a closed form solution since $\\sin(x)$ cannot be calculated in closed form and neither can $2-x-x^2$. Can someone prove this general idea? If it is solvable, then under what conditions? Attempting to reduce the amount of questions that ask for closed form solutions in these scenarios, like Nonlinear algebraic equation with trigonometric function How to solve $x+\\sin(x)=b$ Solving an equation etc. To clarify, closed form in this context is a solution in terms of well-known constants and a finite combination of well-known functions .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all, your example equation doesn't correspond to your problem: your $b$ in $\\sin(ax+b)=\\sin(x)$ is not non-zero - differently from what you have prescribed by your constraints. The conditions of your point 1 (\" $x$ is a rational multiple of $\\pi$ \") can only be met if $b=0$ , but your constraints prohibit zero $b$ . Considering that $\\sin$ and $\\arcsin$ have the exceptional set $\\{0\\}$ (see below), the conditions of your point 2 can only be met if $b=0$ , but your constraints prohibit zero $b$ . Your point 3 is just an assumption from you. Clearly, your thoughts are far from complete. $\\ $ Let me present a more systematic way. \" Closed form \" means expressions of allowed functions. If an equation is solvable in closed form depends therefore on the functions you allow. What you are looking for are solutions that are closed-form numbers . Clearly, answers for closed-form solutions can be given only for single given classes of functions. Clearly, integers, rational numbers and algebraic numbers are usually allowed as closed-form numbers. Let's consider an equation $\\text{trig}(ax+b)=P(x)$ , with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ , $a\\neq 0$ , where $\\text{trig}$ is one of the trigonometric functions and $P\\in\\mathbb{Q}(x)$ is not constant. The trigonometric functions are the functions $\\sin$ , $\\cos$ , $\\tan$ , $\\cot$ , $\\sec$ and $\\csc$ . We can treat this kind of equations in the same way for all trigonometric functions because the function term of a trigonometric function can be represented as a non-conctant rational expression of $e^{ix}$ over the algebraic numbers, e.g.: $\\sin(x)=R(e^{ix})=-\\frac{1}{2}i\\left(e^{ix}-e^{-ix}\\right)$ , with non-constant $R\\in Quot(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}(x))$ . Let's call this kind of presentation of the trigonometric functions their exponential representation. 1.) Algebraic numbers Let's allow the algebraic numbers as closed form. Let $x$ be algebraic. $P(x)$ is algebraic then. For the trigonometric functions, Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem helps to determine the exceptional sets . See my answer at On the behavior of transcendental functions . Because the only algebraic sets of trigonometric functions are $\\{\\}$ or $\\{0\\}$ , $\\text{trig}(ax+b)$ can for algebraic $x$ be algebraic only if $ax+b=0$ $\\ \\ $ ( $x=-\\frac{b}{a}$ ). Let $P(x)$ a polynomial as defined above that has $-\\frac{b}{a}$ as a solution. The trigonometric functions have the following exceptional points. $\\sin,\\tan\\colon (0,0)$ ; $\\cos,\\sec\\colon (0,1)$ . $\\cot$ and $\\csc$ don't have an exceptional point. Of the equations of the kind prescribed in the question, exactly the following have an algebraic solution therefore. $$\\sin(ax+b)=P(x)$$ $$\\tan(ax+b)=P(x)$$ $$\\cos(ax+b)=1+P(x)$$ $$\\sec(ax+b)=1+P(x)$$ 2.) Elementary inverses, Elementary numbers Let's now allow the elementary functions as closed form. The elementary functions are according to Liouville and Ritt those functions of one variable which are obtained in a finite number of steps by performing algebraic operations and taking exponentials and logarithms. a) Solvability of equations by closed-form expressions by rearranging the equation is related to the question of existence of inverses of the functions which are contained in the equation.\nThe incomprehensibly unfortunately hardly noticed theorem of Joseph Fels Ritt in [Ritt 1925], that is also proved in [Risch 1979], answers which kinds of elementary functions can have an inverse which is an elementary function. We can extend this theorem from the inverses of the bijective elementary functions to the partial inverses of arbitrary elementary functions by treating restrictions of the non-bijective elementary functions by restricting their domains. In some cases, you can also take the method of [Rosenlicht 1969]. As mentioned above, for each trigonometric function $\\text{trig}$ , there is an exponential presentation of the equation $\\text{trig}(ax+b)=P(x)$ : $\\ R(e^{i(ax+b)})=P(x)$ , with non-constant $R\\in Quot(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}(x))$ . This equation can be transformed to an equation $P_{1}(e^{i(ax+b)},x)=0$ , where $P_{1}$ is a non-constant binary polynomial over the algebraic numbers because $\\text{trdeg}_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}}(e^{(ax+b)i},x)>0$ . The left-hand side of this equation is an elementary function of $x$ . Let's name it $f$ . If the equation is solvable by applying only elementary functions to the equation that we can read from the equation, the inverse of $f$ has to be an elementary function. A conclusion of the theorem of Ritt in [Ritt 1925] is: If $f$ and its inverse are both elementary, a function term for $f$ in exp-ln representation must exist that doesn't contain an multiary algebraic function. But for each trigonometric function $\\text{trig}$ , $P_1$ is multiary. Therefore we cannot solve the equations by rearranging them by applying only elementary functions that we can read from the equation. b) Solving an equation by closed-form expressions means to find solutions that are closed-form numbers. A closed-form number is a number that is generated by applying a finite number of closed-form functions to a rational number. [Chow 1999] asked this problem. One first and simple solution of the problem is Lin's theorem in [Lin 1983]: \"If Schanuel's conjecture is true and $f(X,Y)\\in\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}[X,y]$ \" is an irreducible polynomial involving both $X$ and $Y$ and $f(\\alpha,exp(\\alpha))=0$ for some non-zero $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{C}$ , then $\\alpha$ is not in EL.\" $EL$ are the elementary numbers . [Chow 1999] treats the explicit elementary numbers. For each trigonometric function $\\text{trig}$ , the equation $P_{1}(e^{(ax+b)i},x)=0$ (see section a) is irreducible and therefore of the kind of Lin's theorem. That means, the equations don't have a non-zero solution that is an elementary number. [Chow 1999] Chow, T.: What is a closed-form number. Am. Math. Monthly 106 (1999) (5) 440-448 [Lin 1983] Ferng-Ching Lin: Schanuel's Conjecture Implies Ritt's Conjectures. Chin. J. Math. 11 (1983) (1) 41-50 [Risch 1979] Risch, R.

Lambert W and Elementary functions Let's now allow the algebraic functions and Lambert W as closed form. We use the exp-ln representation of the trigonometric functions (See e.g. the Wikipedia articles for the single functions or [Abramowitz/Stegun 1970].): $$\\sin(x)=-\\frac{1}{2}ie^{ix}+\\frac{1}{2}ie^{-ix},\\ \\cos(x)=\\frac{1}{2}e^{ix}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-ix},\\ \\tan(x)=-i\\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}},$$ $$\\cot(x)=i\\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}},\\ \\sec(x)=\\frac{2}{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}},\\ \\csc(x)=\\frac{2i}{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}.$$ For each trigonometric function $\\text{trig}$ , the equation $\\text{trig}(ax+b)=P(x)$ can be transformed to a quadratic polynomial equation of $e^{iax}$ : $$p_0(x)+p_1(x)e^{iax}+p_2(x)\\left(e^{iax}\\right)^2=0,$$ where $p_0,p_1,p_2\\in\\mathbb{C}(x)$ , not all simultaneously constant, and $p_2$ not zero. $$e^{iax}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p_1(x)\\pm\\sqrt{p_1(x)^2-4p_0(x)p_2(x)}}{p_2(x)}$$ $$-\\frac{p_2(x)}{p_1(x)\\pm\\sqrt{p_1(x)^2-4p_0(x)p_2(x)}}e^{iax}=1$$ These equations are not in a form to be solved by elementary functions and Lambert W. See my answer at How to check if some equation can be solved using Lambert $\\operatorname{W}$ function. Maybe the equation is solvable by generalized Lambert W.

Special functions and Elementary functions? You could allow algebraic expressions of known Standard functions as closed form: If the trigonometric functions can be decomposed into compositions of algebraic functions and other known algebraically independent Standard functions than $\\exp$ and $\\ln$ , an analog theorem to the theorem of Ritt of [Ritt 1925] could be applied. I hope such a generalization of Ritt's theorem could be proved someday for this class of functions. I made a suggestion at How to extend Ritt's theorem on elementary invertible bijective elementary functions? .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants to prove or disprove that an equation involving a trigonometric function (like sin, cos, tan) with an argument of the form ax + b, where a and b are non-zero rational numbers, combined with a polynomial that has non-zero rational coefficients and a constant term not equal to ±1 or zero, doesn't have a closed-form solution. The example given is sin(x) = 2 - x - x², which apparently has numerical solutions but no closed-form ones.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. Let me list out the assumptions based on the user's description. The trigonometric function has an argument ax + b, where a and b are non-zero rationals. The polynomial part has non-zero rational coefficients, and importantly, the constant term is not ±1 or zero. The problem is to show that such equations aren't solvable in closed form. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: \n\n1. The equation involves exactly one trigonometric function. The user specifies \"either sin, cos, tan, etc.\" So, one trig function only.\n2. The argument of the trigonometric function is of the form ax + b, where a and b are non-zero rational numbers. So, linear argument, not something more complicated.\n3. The polynomial in the equation has non-zero rational coefficients. So, every coefficient in the polynomial is a non-zero rational number. For example, in the given problem, the polynomial is 2 - x - x², which has coefficients 2 (constant term), -1 (x term), and -1 (x² term), all non-zero and rational.\n4. The constant term of the polynomial is not equal to ±1 or zero. So, in the example, the constant term is 2, which is neither ±1 nor zero. This is important because maybe if the constant term were ±1, the equation could be reducible somehow?\n5. The problem is to prove or disprove that such equations do not have a closed-form solution. Closed-form here is defined as a solution in terms of well-known constants and a finite combination of well-known functions.\n\nNow, the user's reasoning is that if x is a rational multiple of π, then the left-hand side (LHS) is algebraic (since sin(rπ) for rational r is algebraic?), but the right-hand side (RHS) is a polynomial with rational coefficients and a constant term not ±1 or zero, which would be transcendental? Wait, but polynomials with rational coefficients evaluated at algebraic numbers are algebraic. So if x is algebraic, then the RHS polynomial (with rational coefficients) evaluated at x would be algebraic. But the LHS, if x is a rational multiple of π, sin(x) is algebraic? Wait, for example, sin(π/6) = 1/2, which is algebraic. But sin(π/3) = √3/2, which is also algebraic. So if x is a rational multiple of π, then sin(x) is algebraic. Then the RHS would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients evaluated at x, so if x is algebraic, then the RHS is algebraic. Wait, but x being a rational multiple of π doesn't necessarily make x algebraic. For instance, π is transcendental, so if x = π, which is not rational multiple, but even if x is a rational multiple of π, like x = π/2, which is transcendental. Wait, but π is transcendental, so any non-zero rational multiple of π is still transcendental. Therefore, if x is a rational multiple of π, x is transcendental. Then the LHS, sin(x), would be transcendental? Because sin(π) = 0, which is algebraic. Wait, but π is transcendental, but sin(π) = 0. Hmm, but x here would be like qπ where q is rational. So if q is non-zero, then x is transcendental. Then sin(x) would be sin(qπ). If q is rational, say q = m/n, then sin(mπ/n) is algebraic. For example, sin(π/3) is √3/2. So even though x is transcendental, sin(x) can be algebraic. So in this case, if x is a rational multiple of π, then sin(x) is algebraic. Then the RHS is a polynomial in x with rational coefficients. But x is transcendental (since it's a non-zero rational multiple of π), so the RHS would be a polynomial in a transcendental number with rational coefficients. If the coefficients are rational and x is transcendental, then the RHS is transcendental, unless the polynomial somehow cancels out the transcendence. But for example, if x is transcendental, then 2 - x - x² is transcendental. Therefore, if x is a rational multiple of π, then LHS is algebraic, RHS is transcendental, so they can't be equal. Therefore, such solutions can't exist in that case.\n\nThen, the user considers another case where x = arcsin(u) where u is algebraic and x is not a rational multiple of π. Then, LHS is u, which is algebraic. The RHS is 2 - x - x². If u is algebraic, then x = arcsin(u). If u is algebraic, then x would be transcendental unless u is 0 or ±1/2 or something? Wait, maybe not. For example, arcsin(1/2) = π/6, which is transcendental. So even if u is algebraic, x = arcsin(u) would be transcendental unless u is 0, which would make x = 0. But in the problem statement, the constant term of the polynomial is not zero, so if x=0, the RHS would be the constant term, which is not zero. So in that case, x=0 is not a solution. So if x = arcsin(u) where u is algebraic, then x is transcendental. Then the RHS is 2 - x - x², which would be transcendental minus transcendental. But unless x is such that 2 - x - x² is algebraic. Wait, but x is transcendental, so 2 - x - x² is transcendental. But u is algebraic. Therefore, equating algebraic (u) to transcendental (RHS) is impossible. Therefore, in this case, there's no solution. So the only possible solutions would be when both sides are transcendental. But the user argues that if x is not a rational multiple of π and not arcsin(u) with u algebraic, then there's no closed-form solution because neither sin(x) nor the polynomial can be expressed in closed form. Wait, but even if x is transcendental, maybe there's some combination? But the user's point is that closed-form solutions typically require expressing x in terms of inverse trigonometric functions or something, but in this case, you end up with equations that can't be inverted neatly.\n\nSo the problem is to formalize this argument into a proof that such equations don't have closed-form solutions under the given conditions. The assumptions need to be clearly listed. Let me check the original problem again to ensure I got all the conditions right.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove or disprove that an equation involving one trig function (either sin, cos, tan, etc) with an argument of the form ax + b for non-zero rational a, b and a polynomial with non-zero rational coefficients and a constant term not equal to ±1 or zero is not solvable in closed form.\n\nSo the key assumptions:\n\n- The equation involves exactly one trigonometric function.\n- The argument of the trigonometric function is ax + b, where a and b are non-zero rationals.\n- The polynomial has non-zero rational coefficients.\n- The constant term of the polynomial is not ±1 or zero.\n- The problem is to show that such equations don't have closed-form solutions.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the assumptions, each should be a single condition. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation involves exactly one trigonometric function (sin, cos, tan, etc.),\nThe trigonometric function has an argument of the form $ax + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are non-zero rational numbers,\nThe polynomial in the equation has non-zero rational coefficients,\nThe constant term of the polynomial is not equal to $\\pm 1$ or zero.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that the equation is not solvable in closed form.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Prove or disprove that ... is not solvable in closed form.\" So the problem statement should be exactly that. The example given had a specific equation, but in this case, the problem is general. So the formatted problem should reflect the general case. But in the example, the problem was about a specific A(n), but here it's a general statement. So the problem part would be the general claim.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as listed, each as separate points, and the problem as the general statement.",
