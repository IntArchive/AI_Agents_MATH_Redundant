    "Content": "It seems well known that the incenter of a triangle lies on the the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles (or equilateral, but that is trivial). Searching the internet, I could not find a simple geometric proof of this fact. Can anyone provide such a proof? Also, when the incenter lies on the Euler line, does it do so in a set location? (For example, we know the centroid is a third of the way from the circumcenter to the orthocenter on the Euler line, does the incenter satisfy any nice ratios like that?)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a nice proof by contradiction. Let the incenter $I$ lie on the Euler line of $ABC$. It is known that orthocenter $H$ and circumcenter $O$ are isogonal conjugates, i.e. $AI$ is the bisector of angle $HAO$. So, (if the point $A$ does not lie on Euler line) $HA/AO=HI/IO$ (angle bisector theorem).\nAlso $HB/BO=HC/CO=HI/IO=HA/AO$.\nAnd we know that all points $X$, such that $YX/ZX=const$, lie on a circle with center on the line $YZ$ (Appolonius circle) So, $A, B, C$ and $I$ lies on the same circle, and that cannot be true.\nWe have assumed that all of points $A, B, C$ don't lie on the Euler line, so, one of them lies on Euler line and that means $ABC$ is isosceles.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the question from Math Stack Exchange about the incenter lying on the Euler line. The original question mentions that it's well-known the incenter is on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral. They're asking for a simple geometric proof and also about the position of the incenter on the Euler line in such cases.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n1. The triangle has an incenter.\n2. The triangle has an Euler line (which exists for any non-equilateral triangle, but equilateral triangles have all centers coinciding).\n3. The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n4. The triangle being isosceles (including equilateral as a special case).\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"if and only if the triangle is isosceles (or equilateral)\". So the equivalence is important here. The assumptions should probably include both directions. But in the format example, assumptions are listed as properties applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter of the triangle lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the \"if and only if\" statement. The example given in the user's instruction had an assumption like \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\", but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions need to be split into each condition. However, in the problem statement, the \"if and only if\" implies two directions. But the original question seems to present the problem as proving the equivalence, so maybe the assumption is just that the triangle is a triangle (with incenter and Euler line existing), and the problem is to show the equivalence between the incenter lying on Euler line and the triangle being isosceles/equilateral.\n\nWait, maybe the assumptions should list the general conditions for the problem. Let's see the example again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But actually, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user's formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But the user provided that example as how to structure.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. The user's example shows that the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem under \"Assumption\" lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So maybe the example is wrong, or the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct if, for example, the original problem actually had n being divisible by 7, but the user's description was different. Maybe the example is not accurate, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn any case, the task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. For the current problem about the incenter and Euler line:\n\nThe problem is to prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral. Also, when it does lie on the Euler line, does it have a specific location?\n\nSo the main assumptions here are:\n\n1. We are considering a triangle.\n2. The triangle has an incenter.\n3. The triangle has an Euler line (which exists unless the triangle is equilateral, but in that case, all centers coincide, so maybe included).\n4. The incenter's position is considered relative to the Euler line.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need these as assumptions because they are inherent in the problem. The key is the \"if and only if\" condition. Since the problem is about equivalence, maybe the assumptions are just the general properties of a triangle. However, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). So maybe the assumptions here should split the two directions? But that's part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. So perhaps the problem should be stated as: Prove that a triangle has its incenter on the Euler line if and only if it is isosceles or equilateral. Then, also address the position when it does.\n\nBut according to the format, the assumptions should list the conditions, and the problem is the question. However, the original problem is asking for a proof of the equivalence, so maybe the assumptions are just that we have a triangle, and the problem is the equivalence statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's example had a mistake. Let me look again. The original example's formatted problem lists assumptions that weren't in the original problem. The original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumptions include \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the user intended to filter unrelated information and list the actual assumptions needed. Maybe the original problem actually had the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's description was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the example is illustrative of how to structure, not necessarily accurate.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter of the triangle lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, in the example, the problem was to prove something under the assumptions listed, but here it's an equivalence. Maybe the correct way is to list the assumptions as the general properties (triangle exists, etc.) and the problem is the equivalence. But the example added an assumption not present in the original problem. So perhaps the user wants to filter out any extra information and list the necessary assumptions for the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove that if a triangle is isosceles or equilateral, then the incenter lies on the Euler line, and conversely, if the incenter lies on the Euler line, the triangle is isosceles or equilateral. So the problem is an equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The triangle is a triangle (has an incenter and Euler line).\n- The problem is to prove the equivalence between the incenter lying on Euler line and the triangle being isosceles/equilateral.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line. Maybe the key is to extract the conditions that are given in the problem. Since the problem is an equivalence, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the general ones (triangle exists), which are too obvious. However, the example included specific assumptions even if the original problem didn't have them. Perhaps the user wants to list the conditions that are part of the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut the original question is an \"if and only if\", so maybe split into two parts. However, the user's example didn't split the equivalence into two directions. It just listed assumptions and the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is:\n\nAssumption: The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nBut that's only one direction. The original problem is an equivalence. So perhaps the formatted problem should capture both directions. But how to fit that into the format.\n\nLooking back, the user's example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" under assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But the original problem was for every integer n. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but following it, for the current problem, maybe list the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral,\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove the equivalence (but that's not possible). Wait, the original problem says \"the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles\". So maybe the problem is to prove this equivalence. But according to the format, the problem is stated as the question. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter of a triangle lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral. Also, determine the location of the incenter on the Euler line in such cases.\n\nBut the assumptions would then be:\n\n- The triangle has an incenter,\n- The triangle has an Euler line,\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral when the incenter is on the Euler line.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are just that the triangle is a triangle (implicit), and the problem is the equivalence statement. However, according to the example, assumptions are conditions that the objects in the problem must satisfy. For the example, even though the original problem was for every integer n, the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to highlight necessary conditions. Maybe in the current problem, the key assumptions are that the triangle is isosceles or equilateral for one direction, and that the incenter is on the Euler line for the other direction. But since it's an equivalence, maybe split into two assumptions for each direction. However, the example didn't do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nAnd then another part:\n\nAssumption: The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nBut the original question is a single problem, so maybe we need to combine them. Given that the example had assumptions listed even when the original problem didn't specify them, perhaps the user wants to extract implicit assumptions. For instance, the incenter existing, the Euler line existing (which they do for any triangle except equilateral, but equilateral is included as trivial). But perhaps the key assumption here is that the triangle is non-equilateral, but the problem includes equilateral as trivial. However, the original problem says \"or equilateral, but that is trivial\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a triangle (i.e., a three-sided polygon).\n- The Euler line exists for the triangle.\n- The incenter exists for the triangle.\n\nBut these are too general. The example had specific assumptions, even if they were incorrect. Maybe the user wants to extract the key conditions for the problem. Since the problem is an equivalence, the key conditions are the two parts of the equivalence. However, according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is isosceles.\n- The triangle is equilateral.\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut this seems messy. Alternatively, considering that the problem is to prove an equivalence, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a triangle with an incenter and Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral. Also, determine the location of the incenter on the Euler line when this occurs.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed, even if they are part of the general problem. Maybe the user wants the assumptions to be the conditions that lead to the problem. Since the problem is an equivalence, there's no one-directional assumption. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter of the triangle lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that a triangle's incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's location on the Euler line in such cases.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the assumptions are part of the problem's conditions. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the problem statement to be as concise as possible, with the assumptions being the conditions that need to be considered. However, given the example, perhaps the assumptions are the general conditions, and the problem is the actual question. For instance:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a triangle.\n- The Euler line of the triangle exists.\n- The incenter of the triangle exists.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's position on the Euler line when this occurs.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example given by the user might have been incorrect, but following it, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence, so perhaps one assumption is redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove an equivalence, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the general existence of the triangle, incenter, and Euler line. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't have certain assumptions, they were added. So maybe the formatted problem should list the two parts of the equivalence as assumptions? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to structure the problem as follows: the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions would be the properties that need to be considered. But since it's an equivalence, each direction has its own assumptions. But the format example didn't handle equivalence. The example had a one-directional proof with added assumptions.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the safest way is to follow the user's example as best as possible, even if it's flawed. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That suggests that the user wants to list the conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if they are part of the original problem's quantifier. However, in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is an integer is redundant. But the user included it. Then, the second assumption that n is divisible by 7 seems to be an added condition, but in reality, the original problem didn't require that. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to proceed.\n\nFor the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's location on the Euler line in such cases.\n\nBut this seems to repeat the problem in the assumptions. Alternatively, since the original question is asking for the proof of the equivalence and the location, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle has an incenter.\n- The triangle has an Euler line.\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line, and determine its location on the Euler line.\n\nBut that would be for one direction. The other direction would need:\n\nAssumption:\n- The incenter lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n\nBut the original problem is a single question asking for both directions and the location. Given the user's example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the conditions that are part of the \"if and only if\" as separate assumptions. However, this isn't straightforward. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is isosceles or equilateral.\n- The incenter of the triangle lies on the Euler line.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter of a triangle lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's location on the Euler line in such cases.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the general ones, and the problem is the equivalence:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a triangle.\n\nProblem: Prove that the incenter lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's location on the Euler line when this occurs.\n\nBut the example included specific assumptions, so perhaps the user wants to list the key properties. Given the original question mentions \"if and only if the triangle is isosceles (or equilateral)\", the key properties are the triangle being isosceles/equilateral and the incenter being on the Euler line. Since it's an equivalence, both are necessary, but in the format, perhaps list them as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into two problems for each direction, but the user wants a single problem. Given the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to follow the example's structure where the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, even if they seem redundant. Since the original problem is an equivalence, perhaps list both conditions as assumptions and state the problem as proving the equivalence. But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is isosceles or equilateral,\nThe incenter of the triangle lies on the Euler line.\nProblem: \nProve that the incenter of a triangle lies on the Euler line if and only if the triangle is isosceles or equilateral, and determine the incenter's location on the Euler line in such cases.\n###",
