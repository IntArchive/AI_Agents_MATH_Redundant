    "Content": "I am trying to understand Nakayama's lemma. It looks like some \"fixed point theorem\". Using Nakayama's lemma , I can easily solve the following question. I want another proof. Thanks. Let $A$ be a commutative ring with identity, $I$ be a finitely generated ideal of $A$, such that $I^2=I$. Show that there exists an element $e\\in I$ with $e^2=e$ and $eA=I$. You can use anything (geometric interpretation are welcomed) except Nakayama's Lemma.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The following proof uses the \"Cayley-Hamilton trick\": Let $x_1,\\cdots,x_n$ generate $I$ as an $A$-module. Since $I=I^2$, we can write: $x_i=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} a_{ij}x_j$ for $1\\leq i\\leq n$ and $a_{ij}\\in I$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq n$, $1\\leq j\\leq n$. In particular, the matrix $M=[\\delta_{ij}-a_{ij}]_{1\\leq i\\leq n,1\\leq j\\leq n}$ ($\\delta_{ij}$ denotes the Kronecker delta) annihilates the column vector $x=[x_j]_{1\\leq j\\leq n}$. If we multiply both sides of the matrix equation $Mx=0$ by the classical adjoint of $M$, we obtain an element of the form $1-e$ for $e\\in I$ (the determinant of $M$) that annihilates every $x_i$. Hence $(1-e)I=0$. Clearly, this implies that $I=eA$ and $e^2=e$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that a finitely generated idempotent ideal is principal, specifically finding an element e in the ideal I such that e is idempotent and generates I. The user mentions not using Nakayama's lemma, but that's part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption of the mathematical problem itself.\n\nSo, looking at the problem: Let A be a commutative ring with identity, I a finitely generated ideal of A, and I² = I. The goal is to show there exists an element e in I with e² = e and eA = I. \n\nAssumptions here would be the properties given in the problem statement. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. A is a commutative ring with identity. (This is a property of A.)\n2. I is a finitely generated ideal of A. (Property of I.)\n3. I² = I. (Another property of I.)\n\nThe problem statement is then to show the existence of such an element e. The user wants to avoid using Nakayama's lemma, but that's part of the problem constraints, not an assumption. Wait, but in the example provided, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7). Here, the problem's own conditions are the assumptions. So in this case, the assumptions are the three points above, each as separate lines. The problem is to find the idempotent e generating I.\n\nI need to ensure that each assumption is a separate line and addresses one object. Let me check again:\n\n- A is commutative with identity: one line.\n- I is finitely generated: another line.\n- I² = I: third line.\n\nYes, each is a separate condition on a single object. The problem is then to prove the existence of e with those properties. So the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
