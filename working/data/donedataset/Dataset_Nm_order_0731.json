    "AcceptedAnswer": "Literally, the claim is wrong, since the space has dimension $2^{\\aleph_0}$, and there are Banach spaces with the same dimension (e.g. the $\\ell^p(\\mathbb{N})$ spaces). Since the rationals are dense in $[a,b]$, there is a linear injection of $C^\\infty([a,b])$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}\\cap [a,b]}$, and the latter space has cardinality $$\\operatorname{card}(\\mathbb{R})^{\\aleph_0} = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0},$$ so $\\dim C^\\infty([a,b]) \\leqslant 2^{\\aleph_0}$. On the other hand, the functions $t\\mapsto e^{ct},\\, c\\in\\mathbb{R}$ are linearly independent, so the dimension is at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$. What is meant, even if it is not said, when that claim is made, is that the space $C^\\infty([a,b])$ in its natural topology - the usual Fréchet space topology induced by the seminorms $\\lVert f\\rVert_k = \\sup \\{ \\lvert f^{(k)}(t)\\rvert : t\\in [a,b]\\}$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ - is not normable. An easy way to see that is to note that $C^\\infty([a,b])$ is a Fréchet-Montel space, that is, every closed and bounded subset is compact. That is a repeated application of the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem; the boundedness of $\\{f^{(k+1)} : f\\in B\\}$ implies the equicontinuity of $\\{ f^{(k)} : f\\in B\\}$. But a normed space has the Montel-Heine-Borel property if and only if it is finite-dimensional.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nThe original problem from Math Stack Exchange is titled: \"Is there a norm in $C^\\infty ([a,b])$ which makes it a Banach space?\" The question asks for a reference that proves there's no norm on $C^\\infty([a,b])$ making it a Banach space.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem mentions $C^\\infty([a,b])$, which is the space of infinitely differentiable functions on the interval [a,b]. The assumptions should include the conditions given. The user in the example broke down each assumption into separate lines. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem states: Let $a,b\\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $a<b$. There is no norm in the space $C^\\infty([a,b])$ which makes it a Banach space.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\n2. $a$ is less than $b$.\n3. The space in question is $C^\\infty([a,b])$, the space of infinitely smooth functions on [a,b].\n4. The problem is about the existence of a norm under which this space becomes a Banach space.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were listed as separate points. For the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the original question doesn't have any conditions beyond a < b and the space being C^infty. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a and b are real numbers.\n- a < b.\n- The space considered is C^infty([a, b]).\n\nBut the problem is whether there exists a norm making this space Banach. The original problem states that there is no such norm. So the problem statement should be to prove that there is no norm on C^infty([a,b]) which makes it a Banach space.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition. In the original problem here, the only conditions are a and b being real with a < b, and the space is C^infty. So those would be the assumptions. Each as separate lines.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- $a$ and $b$ are real numbers,\n- $a < b$,\n- The space is $C^\\infty([a, b])$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no norm on $C^\\infty([a,b])$ which makes it a Banach space.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"Does anyone know a reference which proves the following: Let a,b in R with a < b. There is no norm in the space C^infty([a,b]) which makes it a Banach space.\" So the problem is to prove that statement. Therefore, the problem part is \"Prove that there is no norm on $C^\\infty([a,b])$ making it a Banach space.\"\n\nBut in the example, the user had \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Here, similarly, the problem is to prove the non-existence of such a norm.\n\nSo the assumptions would be each separate condition: a and b are real numbers, a < b, and the space is C^infty([a,b]). Each on a separate line.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check:\n\nFirst assumption: \"a and b are real numbers\" – but the user's example had \"n is an integer\" as one assumption, then \"n is divisible by 7\" as another. Here, \"a and b are real numbers\" is one condition involving two objects. Wait, but maybe the user's example is different. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that might not be the case here. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as a sample. Anyway, perhaps the user's approach is to split into individual conditions even if they involve the same object.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states \"Let a,b in R with a < b.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. a is a real number.\n2. b is a real number.\n3. a < b.\n4. The space is C^infty([a, b]).\n\nBut according to the user's example, they might split \"a and b are real numbers\" into two separate lines. But in the example, the first assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is a single line. So if we follow that, then \"a is a real number\" and \"b is a real number\" would be two separate assumptions. Then \"a < b\" is another assumption. Then the space being C^infty([a,b]) is another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining a and b being real into one assumption. But according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"a is a real number\" and \"b is a real number\" would be two separate assumptions. Then \"a < b\" is another. Then the space is C^infty([a, b]) is the fourth.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user wrote \"Let a,b in R with a < b\", so perhaps the way to split is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $a$ is a real number,\n- $b$ is a real number,\n- $a < b$,\n- The space is $C^\\infty([a, b])$.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no norm on this space which makes it a Banach space.\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. The first two lines define a and b as real numbers, the third their relation, the fourth the space. Then the problem is as stated.",
