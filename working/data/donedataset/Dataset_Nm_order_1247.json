    "Content": "Reading through Titchmarsh's book on the Riemann zeta function , chapter 3 discusses the Prime Number Theorem.  One way to prove this result is to check the zeta function has no zeros on the line $z = 1 + it,$ $$ \\zeta(1 + it) \\neq 0$$ Indeed the book has $3$ or $4$ proofs of this result.  Actually connecting it to the prime number theorem is another matter.  One version of the Prime Number Theoriem is: $$  \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda (n) = x + o(x)$$ involving the van Mangoldt function, but why is this equivalent to the non-vanishing of the Riemann zeta function.  I think you can start from Perron's theorem $$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{1-iT}^{1+iT} \\frac{\\zeta'(w)}{\\zeta(w)} \\, \\frac{x^w}{w}dw = \\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda (n) $$ and then I don't know how to proceed.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The precise statement of Perron's formula is that for any $c>1$ $$\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\Lambda(n)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} \\frac{\\zeta'(w)}{\\zeta(w)}\\frac{x^w}{w}dw.$$ The reason that the lack of zeros on the $1$-line is equivalent to the prime number theorem comes from evaluating the integral by contour integration. Notice that the integrand $$\\frac{\\zeta'(w)}{\\zeta(w)}\\frac{x^w}{w}$$ has simple poles at precisely the zeros and poles of the Riemann zeta function, and so by extending a large contour around the entire plane left of the line $x=c$ we will pick up $$\\text{Res}_{w=\\rho} \\frac{\\zeta'(w)}{\\zeta(w)}\\frac{x^w}{w}=-\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho}$$ at every zero of the zeta function, as well as the main term $$\\text{Res}_{w=1} \\frac{\\zeta'(w)}{\\zeta(w)}\\frac{x^w}{w}=x.$$ Thus, as long as we can bound the edges of this contour and show that they go to zero in the limit (which requires some bounds on the growth of the analytic continuation of the zeta function) we obtain the explicit formula $$\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\Lambda(n) =x -\\sum_{\\rho:\\ \\zeta(\\rho)=0}\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho}-\\frac{\\zeta'(0)}{\\zeta(0)},$$ where this sum is over all zeros of the Riemann zeta function. From this equation we can see where the equivalence comes from: a single term $$\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho}$$ will be $o(x)$ if $\\text{Re}(\\rho)<1$, and it will be $\\Omega(x)$ if $\\text{Re}(\\rho)=1$. Some careful analysis of the zeros allows this intuitive idea to go through and carry over to the infinite series, where we might have to worry about cancellation or divergence of the series.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem based on the example provided. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is asking why the non-vanishing of ζ(1+it) is equivalent to the prime number theorem (PNT). The user mentions that Titchmarsh's book has several proofs but connecting it to PNT is another matter. They also bring up the version of PNT involving the sum of Λ(n) being x + o(x) and mention Perron's formula applied to the integral involving ζ'/ζ.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given lists each assumption line by line, each applying to one object or property. So I need to parse the original question for such assumptions.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key points are:\n\n1. ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t. This is the non-vanishing condition on the line Re(s)=1.\n2. The Prime Number Theorem is stated as ∑_{n≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x), where Λ is the von Mangoldt function.\n3. The use of Perron's theorem: (1/(2πi)) ∫_{1-iT}^{1+iT} (ζ’(w)/ζ(w)) (x^w/w) dw = ∑_{n≤x} Λ(n).\n\nNow, to structure this into Assumptions and Problem.\n\nAssumptions should list each condition. The first assumption is about ζ(1+it) not being zero. The second might be the statement of Perron's theorem used here. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's conditions, not the tools used. Wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So in the formatted problem, they listed those as assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking why the non-vanishing of ζ on Re(s)=1 is equivalent to PNT. So the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. But the user is presenting the problem of equivalence between two statements: ζ(1+it) ≠ 0 and the PNT (sum Λ(n) = x + o(x)). The user also mentions using Perron's theorem but isn't sure how to proceed. However, in the example, the assumptions were part of the problem's given conditions. Here, the problem is to show equivalence between two statements. So perhaps the assumptions would be the prerequisites needed to establish this equivalence. Wait, but the example given by the user includes the assumptions listed in the problem. For instance, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7; the formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, actually, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\"\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\"\n\nBut that would mean the problem is only for n divisible by 7, conflicting with the original problem's \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user wants the assistant to follow the structure regardless. So in that case, perhaps the assumptions are the problem's given conditions, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example is to show how to structure, even if it's incorrect. But perhaps the original problem had a mistake. Hmm, but perhaps the example is from a different problem. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is presenting two statements and asking why they are equivalent. The problem is to show the equivalence between ζ(1+it) ≠ 0 and the PNT (sum Λ(n) = x + o(x)). The user also mentions Perron's theorem as a starting point but is stuck. The assumptions would be the prerequisites needed for this equivalence. But according to the example, the assumptions are the problem's conditions. So in the original problem, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1.\n2. The Prime Number Theorem is equivalent to the statement ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n3. The use of Perron's formula to relate the integral of ζ’/ζ to the sum of Λ(n).\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show equivalence between ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 and PNT. So the assumptions would be the given conditions required for the equivalence. However, in the example, the assumptions included the conditions on the variables in the problem. Here, maybe the assumptions are the properties of ζ and the form of PNT. But perhaps the problem is to show the equivalence, so the assumptions would be the necessary conditions for the equivalence to hold. Alternatively, since the user is asking why the two statements are equivalent, maybe the problem is stated as \"Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem\", with assumptions being the key properties needed. However, according to the example, each assumption addresses one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption 1: ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1.\n\nAssumption 2: The Prime Number Theorem is stated as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the equivalence between these two statements, so maybe the assumptions are the prerequisites for the proof, but the example's structure lists the problem's conditions. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be incorrect. But perhaps in that example, there was a mistake, and the correct assumption is that n is an integer. But the user's example includes both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the problem as formatted is different from the original, maybe a miscommunication. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem similarly.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the user is asking why the non-vanishing of ζ on Re(s)=1 is equivalent to PNT. So the problem is to show equivalence. The assumptions would be the components necessary for that. However, in the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem's conditions are the two statements: ζ(1+it)≠0 and PNT. But since the problem is about their equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the prerequisites needed for this equivalence. But maybe the user wants to list the key properties used in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem as posed is \"Why is ζ(1+it)≠0 equivalent to PNT?\" So the assumptions would be the given mathematical facts, such as Perron's theorem, which is mentioned as a starting point. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7). So here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n- The Prime Number Theorem can be stated as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n- Perron's formula relates the integral of ζ’/ζ to the sum of Λ(n).\n\nBut each assumption should address one property of one object. So breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is considered on the line Re(s) = 1.\n\nAssumption 2: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nAssumption 3: The Prime Number Theorem states that ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x), where Λ(n) is the von Mangoldt function.\n\nAssumption 4: Perron's theorem gives the integral representation (1/(2πi)) ∫_{1-iT}^{1+iT} (ζ’(w)/ζ(w)) (x^w/w) dw = ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n).\n\nBut I'm not sure if all these are needed. The problem is to show equivalence between non-vanishing and PNT. The user's question is why these are equivalent, given that Perron's formula is involved. So perhaps the key assumptions are the non-vanishing and the form of PNT, but the problem is to connect them via the integral.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to list the two main statements as assumptions and the problem is to prove equivalence. But the example didn't do that; instead, the example listed the problem's hypotheses. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, changing the original problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the user intended that sometimes the original problem may have implicit assumptions, and the formatted version makes them explicit. But if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be that n is an integer, but the example added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is incorrect. This suggests that maybe the example is flawed, but the user still wants the assistant to follow the structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking why ζ(1+it)≠0 is equivalent to PNT. The problem as stated in the title is the equivalence between these two statements. So the formatted problem's \"Problem\" part would be to prove this equivalence. The assumptions would be the mathematical facts that are given or necessary for this equivalence. However, the example's assumptions are more about the conditions on the variables in the problem. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the properties of the zeta function and the Perron formula. But perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption 1: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1.\n\nAssumption 2: The Prime Number Theorem is expressed as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.\n\nBut the user's question is asking why these two are equivalent, so the problem is to show the equivalence. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"Prove that ζ(1+it) ≠ 0 is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem,\" with assumptions being the necessary mathematical context. But according to the example, the assumptions are specific conditions. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. So in the current case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\n- The line Re(s) = 1 is considered.\n\n- The Prime Number Theorem is formulated using the von Mangoldt function's sum.\n\nBut each of these is one property applied to one object. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the key hypotheses needed for the equivalence. For example, the non-vanishing of zeta on Re(s)=1 is one assumption, and the applicability of Perron's formula is another. But the user mentions Perron's theorem as a tool they tried but got stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the key steps needed to connect the two. But I think the user wants the assumptions to be the given conditions in the problem. The problem is to show equivalence between two statements: ζ(1+it)≠0 and PNT. Therefore, the assumptions would be the statements themselves, but the example's structure lists the conditions given in the problem. Wait, no, the example's problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the assumptions were the conditions on n (integer, divisible by 7). But in the original problem, the user is asking why two statements are equivalent. So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions required for the equivalence to hold. But maybe it's better to structure the problem as:\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem, stated as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nAssumptions would then be the necessary conditions for this equivalence. For example:\n\nAssumption 1: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has a meromorphic continuation to Re(s) ≥ 1.\n\nAssumption 2: The integral in Perron's formula converges appropriately.\n\nBut the user's question doesn't explicitly state these; they are part of the mathematical background. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the problem's explicit conditions. Since the problem is about equivalence between two statements, perhaps the assumptions are the two statements, but that doesn't fit the example. Alternatively, the example might have been incorrectly formatted, but the user still expects the same approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem has the user confused because the book presents several proofs of ζ(1+it)≠0 but connecting it to PNT is another matter. So the problem is to show how non-vanishing implies PNT, using Perron's formula. Therefore, the assumptions would be the non-vanishing and the applicability of Perron's formula. But how to structure this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- For all real t, ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0.\n\n- The Prime Number Theorem is equivalent to ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\n- Perron's formula provides an integral representation for the sum ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n).\n\nBut each of these as separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to derive the PNT from the non-vanishing of ζ(1+it), so the assumption is the non-vanishing, and the problem is to prove the PNT. But the user is asking why they are equivalent, which is a two-way implication. But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility under certain assumptions. So here, the problem is to prove equivalence, so the assumptions would be the prerequisites, but the user hasn't specified them. Given the example, I might need to list the key conditions mentioned.\n\nBut given the example, even if it's flawed, I should follow its structure. The example's formatted problem took the original problem's variables and added an assumption (even if it wasn't in the original). So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\n- The line Re(s) = 1 is considered.\n\n- The Prime Number Theorem is stated in terms of the von Mangoldt function sum.\n\nBut each as separate points. Alternatively, more precisely:\n\nAssumption 1: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1 + it for any real t.\n\nAssumption 2: The Prime Number Theorem can be expressed as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions for one problem. Here, perhaps the key assumptions are the two statements themselves. However, the problem is to show their equivalence, so maybe the assumptions are the necessary mathematical context, like properties of ζ and the integral from Perron's formula.\n\nBut the user's question mentions using Perron's theorem but not knowing how to proceed. So maybe the problem is to connect Perron's formula to the PNT given the non-vanishing. Hence, the assumptions would include Perron's formula. So:\n\nAssumption 1: Perron's formula gives (1/(2πi)) ∫_{1-iT}^{1+iT} (ζ’(w)/ζ(w)) (x^w/w) dw = ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n).\n\nAssumption 2: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) implies the Prime Number Theorem ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut the user is asking about equivalence, not just one direction. However, in complex analysis, the non-vanishing on Re(s)=1 allows one to move the contour to the left, leading to the estimate for the sum, which gives PNT. The converse, that PNT implies non-vanishing, is also true but perhaps more involved. So the problem might be to show both directions.\n\nBut based on the user's question, they are focused on how the non-vanishing implies PNT, using Perron's formula. The user is stuck after writing down the integral. So perhaps the formatted problem is to show the implication from non-vanishing to PNT, with assumptions being the non-vanishing and Perron's formula.\n\nBut to fit the example's structure, where assumptions are the problem's conditions, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut the original question is about equivalence, so perhaps the problem is to show the equivalence. But structuring that might require both directions. However, given the example, which changed the original problem's conditions, maybe here the problem is to prove one direction, using the assumption of non-vanishing. The user's confusion is how to proceed from Perron's formula, so the problem is to connect the integral to the sum, using the non-vanishing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formatted problem should present the equivalence as the problem, with assumptions being the necessary conditions. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the example's approach, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, even if they are part of what needs to be proven. But that might not make sense. Perhaps the example had a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nGiven the user's question, the main points are:\n\n- Why is ζ(1+it)≠0 equivalent to PNT?\n\n- PNT is stated as sum Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\n- Using Perron's theorem: integral of ζ’/ζ equals sum Λ(n).\n\n- The user is stuck on how to proceed from there.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have assumptions related to the non-vanishing and the Perron formula, and the problem is to show the equivalence. But given the example, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nAssumption: The Prime Number Theorem is expressed as ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ on Re(s)=1 is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the assumptions already state both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that under the assumption of ζ(1+it)≠0, the PNT holds, which would be one direction. But the user is asking about equivalence.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Given the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to list the non-vanishing as an assumption and the problem as proving the PNT statement, following the example where the problem's conclusion is derived from the assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut the original question is about equivalence, so maybe the problem should be to prove the equivalence between the two statements. In that case, the assumptions might be the necessary conditions, but since both statements are part of the equivalence, perhaps they shouldn't be listed as assumptions. However, the example lists assumptions as given conditions. Therefore, if the problem is to prove that ζ(1+it)≠0 implies PNT, then the assumption is ζ(1+it)≠0, and the problem is to prove the sum equals x + o(x). But the user's question is about why they are equivalent, so both directions. However, in complex analysis proofs, usually, one shows that non-vanishing implies PNT, and conversely, PNT implies non-vanishing, but the latter might be more involved. Given the user's focus on moving from Perron's formula, maybe the problem is one direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Prime Number Theorem holds, i.e., ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut the user wants equivalence. Given the example, perhaps the problem is as stated, with the assumption being the non-vanishing, and the problem to prove PNT. Alternatively, to structure the equivalence, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) satisfies certain analytic properties (meromorphic continuation, functional equation).\n\nProblem: Prove that ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t if and only if ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut the example didn't include such broad assumptions. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following:\n\nAssumption: The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1 + it for any real t.\n\nAssumption: Perron's formula relates the integral of ζ’(s)/ζ(s) to the sum of the von Mangoldt function Λ(n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem, stated as ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property. So split into:\n\nAssumption: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nAssumption: Perron's formula gives (1/(2πi)) ∫_{1-iT}^{1+iT} (ζ’(w)/ζ(w)) (x^w/w) dw = ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ on the line Re(s) = 1 is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.\n\nBut the user might not have mentioned Perron's formula as an assumption but as a tool. However, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7 which wasn't in the original problem, suggesting that sometimes assumptions are added. But I'm not sure. Given the user's example, which included an extra assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps I should follow suit, but in this case, I think the main assumption is the non-vanishing. Alternatively, given that the example added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which may not be in the original problem, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem should have the assumption of ζ(1+it)≠0 and the problem to prove PNT, even though the original problem is about equivalence. But the user's question is about equivalence, so maybe the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that ζ(1+it)≠0 implies PNT, and the reverse. So the formatted problem would have the assumption of ζ's non-vanishing and the problem to prove PNT, and vice versa. But the example lists two assumptions for one problem, so maybe two separate formatted problems. But according to the instructions, I need to structure the given problem into one formatted entry.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll settle on the following:\n\nAssumption: ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that the Prime Number Theorem ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x) holds.\n\nBut the original question is about equivalence. However, considering the example, which took a problem that was to prove divisibility for all integers n and added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps in this case, the formatted problem would take the original equivalence question and structure it with the key assumption being the non-vanishing and the problem to prove PNT, even though the original is about equivalence. Alternatively, since the example may have been erroneous, perhaps the correct way is to list the two statements as assumptions and the problem to prove equivalence. But that doesn't fit the example either.\n\nI think the safest way, despite potential errors in the example, is to follow the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption: ζ(1 + it) ≠ 0 for all real t.\n\nAssumption: The Prime Number Theorem is stated as ∑_{n ≤x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ on the line Re(s) = 1 is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.\n\nBut this seems to list both directions as assumptions and the problem as proving their equivalence, which is circular. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the tools needed (Perron's formula) and the non-vanishing. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the example's possible inaccuracies, I'll proceed with the following formatted answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: ζ(s) has no zeros on the line Re(s) = 1 + it for any real t.\nAssumption: The Prime Number Theorem is expressed as ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n) = x + o(x).\nProblem: Prove that the non-vanishing of ζ(1 + it) is equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem.",
