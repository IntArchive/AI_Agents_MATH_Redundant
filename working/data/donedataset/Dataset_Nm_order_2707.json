    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure it according to the given format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving a sum of sine terms with coefficients. Let me start by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions a sequence {a_n} that's non-increasing and positive. So, the first assumption is that {a_n} is a non-increasing positive sequence. Then, it states that for n ≥ 2001, n*a_n ≤ 1. That's another assumption: for each n ≥ 2001, the term a_n is bounded by 1/n. \n\nThe problem requires showing that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and any real number x, the absolute value of the sum from k=2001 to m of a_k sin(kx) is at most 1 + π. So the problem statement is to prove that this sum's absolute value is ≤ 1 + π under the given assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is listed separately. The first assumption is about the sequence being non-increasing and positive. The second assumption is about the bound n*a_n ≤ 1 for n starting at 2001. Then the problem is the inequality involving the sum. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"non-increasing postive sequence\". So the sequence is positive and non-increasing. So two properties here: positivity and non-increasing. But according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore, I should split the first assumption into two: the sequence {a_n} is positive, and the sequence {a_n} is non-increasing. Then the third assumption is for each n ≥ 2001, n*a_n ≤ 1. \n\nBut in the example provided, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is one condition per line. Therefore, for the sequence {a_n}, being positive and non-increasing are two separate assumptions. Then the third assumption is the inequality for n ≥ 2001. Then the problem is the inequality involving the sum. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The sequence {a_n} is positive.\n- The sequence {a_n} is non-increasing.\n- For each integer n ≥ 2001, n*a_n ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any integer m ≥ 2001 and any real number x, the inequality \n$$\\left|\\sum\\limits_{k=2001}^{m}a_{k}\\sin{(kx)}\\right|\\le 1+\\pi$$\nholds.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The problem states \"non-increasing postive sequence\" so that's two separate conditions. Then \"for n ≥ 2001, na_n ≤ 1\" is another condition. The conclusion is the inequality involving the sum from k=2001 to m. The variables m and x are quantified as m ≥ 2001 (positive integer) and x real. So the problem statement should include those quantifiers. The example uses \"for every integer n\" in the problem statement, so here it's similar: \"for any positive integer numbers m ≥ 2001, x ∈ R\".\n\nTherefore, in the problem statement, it should be written as: Prove that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and any real number x, the inequality holds. So the formatted problem should have the problem statement exactly as such. The example had \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91\" without repeating the quantifiers, but in the original example's problem statement, the quantifier was included in the problem line. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: Assumptions included n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Then the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". But the original problem had the quantifier \"for every integer n\". So maybe in the example, they split the general quantifier into an assumption. So in the current problem, the user's problem states \"for any positive integer numbers m ≥ 2001, x ∈ R\", so these should be part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Wait, but according to the format, the assumptions are the conditions on the objects. The problem is the statement to prove, which should include the quantifiers. \n\nWait, looking at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, so in that example, they took the general \"for every integer n\" and split into assumptions. But in the problem statement, they just restate the conclusion. However, in the original problem, there was an additional condition that n is divisible by 7? Wait no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem may have had a different assumption. Wait, perhaps there was a typo or misunderstanding in the example. But given the user's example, it seems that the problem statement is written without the quantifiers, and the quantifiers are moved to assumptions. \n\nBut in the current problem, we have to structure it according to the user's example. So, for instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption and then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So similarly, in the current problem, the quantifiers \"for any positive integer m ≥ 2001, x ∈ R\" would be part of the problem statement. Wait, but the problem statement in the example didn't include the quantifiers. Wait, the user's example formatted problem as:\n\nProblem: Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the quantifier \"for every integer n\" was present. So in the formatted problem, the user moved the quantifier into assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the problem is \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer. So perhaps the problem statement is written in terms of A(n) without the quantifier, because the assumption already includes that n is an integer. But that seems conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the example was not correctly formatted. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n- n is an integer,\n- n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user rephrased it. This is confusing. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the example. The key is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement is the core statement to prove, possibly without repeating the quantifiers if they are already captured in the assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n1. The sequence {a_n} is positive.\n2. The sequence {a_n} is non-increasing.\n3. For each integer n ≥ 2001, n*a_n ≤ 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and any real x, the sum's absolute value is ≤ 1 + π. However, according to the user's example, the problem statement would not include the quantifiers but rely on the assumptions. But in this case, the quantifiers are part of the problem's conclusion. So how to handle that?\n\nWait, in the example, the problem statement is about A(n) being divisible by 91, assuming n is an integer (from the assumptions). So perhaps the problem statement can be phrased as:\n\nProve that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and real x, |sum ...| ≤ 1 + π.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement may not include the quantifiers if they are part of the assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the problem statement is for all n (as per the assumption), hence the quantifier is captured in the assumption. Therefore, in the current problem, the quantifiers \"for any positive integer m ≥ 2001\" and \"x ∈ R\" should be part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Because the assumptions are about the sequence {a_n} and the conditions on n (n ≥ 2001 implies m ≥ 2001). Wait, but m is any positive integer ≥ 2001, and x is any real number. These are not assumptions on {a_n} or n, but rather on m and x. Therefore, in the problem statement, we have to specify that m and x are arbitrary (any m ≥ 2001 and x real), but the assumptions are about {a_n} and n. \n\nTherefore, the problem statement should read: Prove that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and real x, the inequality holds. So the problem line includes the quantifiers, while the assumptions are about the sequence and the bound n*a_n.\n\nSo final formatting:\n\nAssumption:\n- The sequence {a_n} is positive.\n- The sequence {a_n} is non-increasing.\n- For each integer n ≥ 2001, n*a_n ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any positive integer m ≥ 2001 and any real number x, \n$$\\left|\\sum\\limits_{k=2001}^{m}a_{k}\\sin{(kx)}\\right|\\le 1+\\pi$$\n\nYes, this seems right. Each assumption is a single condition, applied to one object (the sequence, the sequence again, and then each n ≥ 2001). The problem statement includes the quantifiers for m and x.",
