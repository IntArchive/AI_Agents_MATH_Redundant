    "Content": "I'm confused about the following proposition Proposition . Let $U,V$ are open sets in $\\mathbf{C}$. If $f:U\\to V$ is holomorphic and bijective, then  the inverse  $f^{-1}:V\\to U$ is also holomorphic. The proof of the proposition think that the  continuity of $f^{-1}$ is obvious, but I find it is really difficult to prove  using $\\epsilon-\\delta$ definition. Can anyone give some hints?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Step 1: $f'$ is never zero. Indeed, if $f'(a)=0$ for some $a\\in U$, then the Taylor expansion at $a$ is of the form $f(z)=f(a) + c_n (z-a)^n+\\dots$ with $n\\ge 2$, $c_n\\ne 0$. This implies that $g(z) = (f(z)-f(a))/(z-a)^n$ is a nonzero holomorphic function near $a$, hence admits an $n$th degree root (a function $h$ such that $h^n=g$). Hence $$f(z) = f(a) +  [(z-a)h(z)]^n$$\nSince $z\\mapsto (z-a) h(z)  $ is an open map, its image contains a neighborhood of $0$; in particular it contains the points $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon \\exp(2\\pi i /n)$ for small $\\epsilon$. These two points are sent into one, contradicting  the injectivity of $f$. Step 2: Inverse is smooth This is just the Inverse function theorem: writing out $f=u+iv$, one can see that the Jacobian determinant of $(x,y)\\mapsto (u,v)$ is $|f'(z)|^2\\ne 0$. Step 3: Inverse is holomorphic Also the Inverse function theorem. Writing the derivative of $f$ as a $2\\times 2$ real matrix, we get something of the form\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b& a\\end{pmatrix}$$\ndue to the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The inverse of such a matrix is also of this form: hence, $f^{-1}$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to a single object. The problem statement then follows.\n\nLooking at the original question: The title is \"The inverse of a bijective holomorphic function is also holomorphic\". The question body mentions Proposition: Let U, V be open sets in C. If f: U→V is holomorphic and bijective, then the inverse f⁻¹: V→U is also holomorphic. The user is confused because the proof considers the continuity of f⁻¹ obvious, but they struggle to prove it using ε-δ definition. They ask for hints.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The proposition states that U and V are open sets in the complex plane. The function f is holomorphic and bijective. The conclusion is that f⁻¹ is holomorphic. The user's specific issue is about the continuity of f⁻¹, but the main problem to structure is the proposition itself, as that's the problem statement.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are: U is an open set in C, V is an open set in C, f: U→V is holomorphic, f is bijective. Each of these is a separate condition on a single object. The problem is to prove that f⁻¹ is holomorphic. The user's difficulty is with the continuity part, but the problem as per the proposition is about holomorphicity of the inverse. However, the original problem in the proposition is exactly as stated. The assumptions are U and V open in C, f holomorphic and bijective.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example had an error? Wait, the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem had an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. That seems like an error. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions. So for the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question as per the format.\n\nSo, the proposition's assumptions are:\n\n- U is an open subset of the complex plane.\n\n- V is an open subset of the complex plane.\n\n- f: U → V is a holomorphic function.\n\n- f is bijective.\n\nProblem: Prove that the inverse function f⁻¹: V → U is also holomorphic.\n\nThe original question's problem is exactly that proposition. The user is stuck on proving continuity of f⁻¹, but the main problem is the holomorphicity. So in the formatted problem, we need to present the proposition's problem, not the user's specific difficulty. Because the format is to structure the problem as per the original question's main problem, which is the proposition.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the four points above. Each in separate lines. Then the problem is to prove f⁻¹ is holomorphic.\n\nBut wait, the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, maybe there was a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So that changes the problem from \"for all n\" to \"for n divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions as per their example. So in that example, they split the problem's original assumptions into separate lines. But in the original problem, the only assumption is that n is an integer, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Which might be because 91=7*13, and perhaps the problem was actually for n divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. But perhaps the example is faulty. Anyway, moving on.\n\nIn the current problem, the proposition is that if U and V are open in C, f: U→V is holomorphic and bijective, then f⁻¹ is holomorphic. The assumptions here are the four points: U open, V open, f holomorphic, f bijective. Each as separate lines. The problem is to prove f⁻¹ is holomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these four as separate assumptions, then state the problem as proving the inverse is holomorphic.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was restructured to include assumptions that might not all have been explicit. Wait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. But regardless, I have to follow the current problem.\n\nSo, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption: U is an open set in the complex plane.\n\nAssumption: V is an open set in the complex plane.\n\nAssumption: f: U → V is a holomorphic function.\n\nAssumption: f is bijective.\n\nProblem: Prove that the inverse function f⁻¹: V → U is also holomorphic.\n\nEach assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nTherefore, the answer should follow that structure.",
