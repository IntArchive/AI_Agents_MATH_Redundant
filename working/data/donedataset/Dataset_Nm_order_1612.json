    "Content": "How do I go about proving $f(x)=\\sin(1/x)$ is not uniformly continuous? (Or: different question, but same intention* how do I prove that $x\\sin(x)$ is not uniformly continuous) *I'm trying to grasp how one would prove $f$ is not uniformly continuous for functions other than the simple $x^n$. I have seen one technique being to set an $\\epsilon$ and set $x, y$ in the form of $\\delta$ (e.g. $\\delta/2$, etc.) then subsequently proving that $f(x)-f(y)\\ge\\epsilon$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Ultimately a very brief solution could be given to this problem, but I decided to write in some detail how you might approach it. You want to negate the following: $$\\forall \\varepsilon>0,\\exists\\delta>0,\\forall x,y, |x-y|<\\delta\\implies|f(x)-f(y)|<\\varepsilon.$$ You can write out what that negation is rather mechanically, swapping universal and existential quantifiers, until you finally negate the implication by ensuring that $|x-y|<\\delta$ and $|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq \\varepsilon$.  See here for a discussion of dissecting analysis problems like this by Tim Gowers. That is, you want to prove: $$\\exists \\varepsilon>0,\\forall\\delta>0,\\exists x,y,\\text{ such that } |x-y|<\\delta\\text{ and }|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq\\varepsilon.$$ Before giving the final argument, it is a good idea to experiment in a \"backwards\" fashion; think about where you want to end up and how you can get there.  Roughly, the conclusion \"$|x-y|<\\delta\\text{ and }|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq\\varepsilon$\" will be saying that $x$ and $y$ will be close while $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ will stay a distance $\\varepsilon$ away.  The property of $\\sin(1/x)$ that allows this to happen is that it oscillates like crazy between $1$ and $-1$ over smaller and smaller intervals of $x$ values.  So there will be \"nearby\" $x$ and $y$ such that $f(x)=-1$ and $f(y)=1$.  The distance between the function values here is $2$, while the distance between the input values can be arbitrarily small.  This leads to the conclusion that $\\varepsilon = 2$ will be a sufficient choice. Next, with $\\varepsilon$ fixed at $2$, and $\\delta>0$ arbitrary but fixed, you need to show that there are $x$ and $y$ with $|x-y|<\\delta$ and $|f(x)-f(y)|\\geq 2$.  As indicated above, the last part can be achieved by ensuring that $f(x)=-1$ and $f(y)=1$.  For what $x$ and $y$ is it true that $\\sin(1/x)=-1$ and $\\sin(1/y)=1$?  Use what you know about the sine function to answer this question (I'll leave this to you).  Notice that the choices of such $x$ and $y$ get arbitrarily close to $0$, and in particular you can choose such $x$ and $y$ with $0<x,y<\\delta$, which implies that $|x-y|<\\delta$. Largely the same approach applies to $x\\sin(x)$, except that its reason for not being uniformly continuous changes.  Now the problem is where $x$ gets very large, and the rate of oscillation doesn't change, but the amplitude does.  A hint is to consider the function values at $x=2\\pi n$ and $y=2\\pi n + c$, where $c>0$ is \"small\", as $n$ goes to infinity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, so I need to be precise and methodical.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving that the function f(x) = sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous. Alternatively, there's a mention of another function, x sin(x), but the main focus seems to be on sin(1/x). The user also mentions they want to understand the general technique for proving a function isn't uniformly continuous, especially beyond simple cases like polynomials.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. So for this problem, I need to list all the assumptions. But what are the assumptions here? The function f(x) = sin(1/x) is defined on some domain. Since the question is about uniform continuity, the domain is crucial. Uniform continuity depends on the domain's properties. For example, sin(1/x) is defined on (0, ∞) but usually considered on (0,1) or another bounded interval near zero. Wait, but actually, the standard example for non-uniform continuity is on (0,1), which is not closed. However, the exact domain isn't specified in the problem. The original question just says \"f(x) = sin(1/x)\" without specifying the domain. But in real analysis, when this function is discussed in the context of uniform continuity, the domain is typically an interval like (0,1) or (0, a) where there's a discontinuity or oscillatory behavior near zero. So maybe I should assume the domain is (0,1) unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, the problem statement as given in the user's example didn't include domain assumptions, but in the example they had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are about the function's domain. Since the question is about uniform continuity, the domain is important. If the domain isn't specified, but the problem is to prove that sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous, then the domain is likely (0,1) or a similar interval where the function isn't uniformly continuous. Alternatively, maybe the domain is all real numbers except x=0, but uniform continuity is usually considered on intervals. So I need to check standard examples.\n\nIn standard analysis textbooks, sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous on (0,1). Therefore, the assumption here would be that the domain is (0,1). But the original problem statement doesn't specify this, so perhaps the user expects the assumption to be that the function is considered on its usual domain where it's not uniformly continuous. Alternatively, maybe the function is considered on (0, ∞), but the critical point is near zero. So the key assumption here is the domain where the function is defined. However, since the problem is presented without specifying the domain, maybe the user expects the assumption to be about the domain being an interval where the function is not uniformly continuous, like (0,1). Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the domain is an open interval containing points where the function oscillates increasingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require domain assumptions because the user is asking for a general method. Wait, the problem is \"Prove that f(x) = sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous.\" So perhaps the main assumption is the domain. But since it's not given, maybe we need to infer it. However, in the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's hidden conditions. In this case, maybe the assumption is that the domain is (0,1), which is a common example. Alternatively, maybe the problem is stated in a way that assumes the reader knows the domain. Since the user wants to structure the problem, maybe the assumption is that the domain is an interval where the function is not uniformly continuous. But how to phrase that?\n\nWait, in the original example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem statement, those were part of the original problem's conditions. So in this case, for the sin(1/x) problem, the key assumptions would be about the domain. Since the user wants to filter out unrelated information, perhaps the assumption here is that the domain is (0,1). But the original problem doesn't mention the domain. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the function definition, but the user needs to structure the problem as per the format. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example was modified? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's a conflict. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a miscommunication. Wait, maybe the example given by the user is incorrect. Wait, maybe the user intended that the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but it wasn't stated. Or perhaps the example is wrong. Because if the original problem is \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user wants to list the assumptions from the problem. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. Then the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's not consistent with the original problem. So perhaps there's confusion here. Maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption, but in any case, the user's example might be flawed. However, moving forward, perhaps the user wants to extract all the assumptions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem about sin(1/x), the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function f is defined as f(x) = sin(1/x).\n2. The domain of f is an interval where f is not uniformly continuous, such as (0, 1).\n\nBut since the original problem doesn't specify the domain, perhaps the assumption is that the domain is (0,1). However, in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7) which was not stated in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, 91 = 13*7. So maybe the example intended that n must be divisible by 7, but that wasn't stated. This suggests that perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but regardless, the task is to structure the given problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking how to prove that sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous. The question also mentions another function x sin(x) as an alternative, but the main focus is sin(1/x). The user wants to know the technique for proving such functions are not uniformly continuous, especially beyond simple cases like x^n.\n\nSo, to structure this into assumptions and problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The function f is defined by f(x) = sin(1/x).\n- The domain of f is an open interval near 0, such as (0, 1).\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) = sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous.\n\nBut the original question didn't specify the domain. However, in standard analysis problems, when proving that sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous, the domain is typically taken as (0,1) or (0, ∞), but near zero. So perhaps the assumption is that the domain is (0,1). Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes the domain is (0, ∞), but the key point is near zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key assumption is that the function is considered on a non-compact interval where it's not uniformly continuous. But since uniform continuity is a property that depends on the domain, specifying the domain is crucial. But the original problem doesn't mention it, so perhaps the answer should include the assumption about the domain.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but it was added as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user wants to list the implicit assumptions, even if they are not stated. However, in the original problem example, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That might be a mistake, but following that example, perhaps in this case, we need to infer assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example had a typo, and the original problem actually had the condition that n is divisible by 7, but it wasn't displayed correctly. But without knowing, I have to proceed.\n\nGiven that the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps in this case, for the sin(1/x) problem, the assumption is that the domain is (0,1). But since the original problem doesn't specify, maybe the correct approach is to not list domain assumptions unless specified. However, since uniform continuity is domain-dependent, the problem is incomplete without specifying the domain. Therefore, perhaps the answer should include the domain as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous on its natural domain (which is ℝ \\ {0}), but that's not an interval, and uniform continuity is usually considered on intervals. So perhaps the standard domain is (0,1). Therefore, the assumption is that the domain is (0,1).\n\nAnother approach: The question is \"how to prove sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous.\" The standard proof involves choosing two sequences that converge to zero such that the difference in function values doesn't go to zero, even though the differences in x-values go to zero. For example, take x_n = 1/(2πn + π/2) and y_n = 1/(2πn - π/2). Then |x_n - y_n| goes to zero, but |f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |1 - (-1)| = 2, which is bounded below by ε=1. Therefore, uniform continuity fails.\n\nBut to apply this, the domain must include these points x_n and y_n, which are approaching zero. So the domain must be an interval that includes points approaching zero, like (0,1). Therefore, the assumption is that the domain is such an interval. But since the original problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's necessary to include that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considered on the entire domain where the function is defined, but that's (0, ∞) or (-∞,0) ∪ (0, ∞). But uniform continuity is usually discussed on intervals. So perhaps the assumption is that the domain is (0,1). Therefore, I should list that as an assumption.\n\nIn the example given, the user added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7). So following that approach, perhaps here we need to list implicit assumptions. But I need to be careful. Since the problem is to prove sin(1/x) is not uniformly continuous, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The function f is defined by f(x) = sin(1/x).\n2. The domain of f is an open interval containing 0 (but not including 0) where the function is not uniformly continuous, such as (0,1).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention the domain, so perhaps the answer should list the domain as an assumption. However, in the example, the assumption was added even though it wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the user's intention is to extract all necessary assumptions, even if they are implicit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem as stated doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the function definition, so the only assumption is that f(x) = sin(1/x). But that's not sufficient. Uniform continuity is a property relative to a domain, so the domain must be specified. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to list the domain as an assumption. Since the original problem doesn't specify, but the standard example uses (0,1), I will include that as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$,\n- The domain of $f$ is the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$ is not uniformly continuous.\n\nAlternatively, if the domain is not considered an assumption but part of the problem statement, but in the example, the problem was rewritten to include the function definition in the problem statement. So perhaps the assumptions are only about the conditions on the variables or domain. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was:\n\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions:\n- $n$ is an integer,\n- $n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $A(n)$ is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumptions add that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory unless there's a misunderstanding. Because if n must be divisible by 7, then it's not for every integer n. This suggests that the example might be incorrect. However, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user intended that n is divisible by 7, but the way it's written is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the example is wrong, but I need to follow the user's structure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, even if the original problem doesn't specify the domain, we need to include it as an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$,\n- The domain of $f$ is $(0, 1)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is not uniformly continuous.\n\nAlternatively, if the user considers the domain as part of the problem statement, then it might be written as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0, 1)$.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement included the function definition in the problem, not in the assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are only additional conditions. For example, in the original example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but if we follow that, perhaps the assumptions here are additional conditions beyond what's stated. However, in the current problem, there are no additional conditions; the question is directly about proving non-uniform continuity.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to list the function definition and domain as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$,\n- $f$ is defined on the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is not uniformly continuous.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the function $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$ defined on $(0, 1)$ is not uniformly continuous.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem should be separate from the assumptions. In the example, the assumptions included properties of n (integer, divisible by 7), and the problem was the rest. So in this case, the assumptions are the function's definition and its domain, and the problem is to prove it's not uniformly continuous.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \\sin(1/x)$,\n- The domain of $f$ is the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is not uniformly continuous.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with the example structure, even if the example's original problem had conflicting assumptions. The key is to split the problem into assumptions (conditions, definitions) and the problem statement.",
