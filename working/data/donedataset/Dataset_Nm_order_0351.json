    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"Fourier series of Log sine and Log cos,\" and the question presents two identities involving logarithms of sine and cosine expressed as Fourier series. The user asks how to prove these identities.\n\nNow, according to the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the problem provided here, the question is about proving two Fourier series expansions for -log(sin x) and -log(cos x). The assumptions here might relate to the domain of x where these identities hold. For instance, for the logarithm of sine and cosine to be real, x must be in a certain interval where sin(x) and cos(x) are positive. Also, the Fourier series typically have convergence conditions, like x not being a multiple of π or something similar.\n\nLet me check the original identities. The first one is -log(sin x) equals the sum from k=1 to infinity of cos(2kx)/k plus log(2). Similarly for -log(cos x) with an alternating sign. These series are Fourier series expansions. The standard Fourier series for -log(2 sin x) is known, so maybe here they are adjusted with x in a specific interval.\n\nAssumptions needed would include that x is a real number where the logarithm is defined, so sin(x) and cos(x) must be positive. For sin(x), x should be in (0, π) to keep sin(x) positive. For cos(x), x should be in (-π/2, π/2) perhaps? But the Fourier series might have different intervals of validity. Also, the convergence of the series requires that x is not an integer multiple where the terms become singular. Additionally, the series might require x not to be a point where cos(2kx) becomes 1 or -1, but I think the main assumption is the domain of x where the original functions are defined and the series converge.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x is a real number such that sin(x) > 0 (for the first identity)\n- x is a real number such that cos(x) > 0 (for the second identity)\n- The Fourier series converges for x in the appropriate interval.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split them into separate assumptions for each identity. Also, maybe the interval specifics. Alternatively, if the problem doesn't specify the domain, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in the original question, like x being in (0, π/2) for both sine and cosine to be positive? Wait, but for cos(x) to be positive, x can be in (-π/2, π/2), but the Fourier series might be considered over a specific interval, like 0 < x < π for the sine and -π/2 < x < π/2 for cosine. However, the problem as stated doesn't specify these, so perhaps the assumptions are just that x is in the domain where the logarithm is defined and the series converge.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the standard ones for Fourier series of these functions. The example given in the user's example included divisibility conditions that were part of the problem but perhaps not stated explicitly. However, in this case, the problem as posed on Math Stack Exchange doesn't list assumptions; the user is just asking for proof of the identities. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the standard ones required for the Fourier series to hold. But according to the format, we need to list assumptions. So perhaps the key assumptions are the domains of x where the identities hold.\n\nLooking back at the original problem, the user just quotes the two identities and asks for proof. The linked question might have more context, but the user here only provides the two equations. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption says \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition? Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the task, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the question is to prove the two identities. The assumptions would be the conditions under which these identities hold. For example, for the first identity, -log(sin x) is equal to the sum plus log(2). The logarithm is defined when sin(x) > 0, so x in (0, π) modulo 2π. Similarly, for the second identity, cos(x) > 0, so x in (-π/2, π/2) modulo 2π. Additionally, the Fourier series converge under certain conditions. For example, the Fourier series for -log(sin x) might converge for x not equal to multiples of π where sin(x) is zero.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify these, so the assumptions are implicit. Therefore, to follow the example's approach, perhaps list the domain assumptions for x in each case.\n\nSo for the first identity:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that sin(x) > 0.\n\nFor the second identity:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that cos(x) > 0.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps that the series converges, but maybe that's part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, since the problem asks to prove the identities, the assumptions are the conditions required for the equality to hold.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number where sin(x) > 0.\n\nAssumption: x is a real number where cos(x) > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\sin(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\cos(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-1)^k\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2)\n$$\n\nBut since each assumption should apply to one object, perhaps split them into two separate assumptions for each identity. Also, note that in the example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But here, each identity has its own domain assumption. Therefore, list each assumption for each function.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove both identities, the assumptions are x in appropriate domains for each. So the formatted problem would have two assumptions (one for each identity) and the problem is to prove both identities.\n\nBut the example only had one problem statement. The user's example had two assumptions but one problem. Here, there are two identities to prove, so perhaps the problem is stated as proving both, with two assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considered as two separate problems, but the user presented them as one. Since the original question asks to prove \"these two identities,\" it's one problem with two parts. So the assumptions are two: one for each identity's domain.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that sin(x) > 0.\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that cos(x) > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\sin(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\cos(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-1)^k\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2).\n$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption was split into two lines, each for one property. Here, the two assumptions are about different functions (sin and cos), so each gets its own line.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps the problem doesn't require any additional assumptions beyond the standard ones for the Fourier series, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions. But the example included assumptions even if the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". But in the example, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that in the example, the original problem had an error, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7. But that's unclear. However, following the user's instruction, they want to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem\" as per the format. The original problem here is to prove the two identities. The user didn't specify any particular conditions, but mathematically, the identities hold under certain domains. Therefore, the assumptions should include the domains where the identities are valid.\n\nThus, I think the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that sin(x) > 0.\n\nAssumption: x is a real number such that cos(x) > 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\sin(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n-\\log(\\cos(x))=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty(-1)^k\\frac{\\cos(2kx)}{k}+\\log(2).\n$$\n\nBut I need to check if there are other assumptions. For example, the convergence of the series. However, since the problem is to prove the identities, the convergence might be part of the proof rather than an assumption. The key assumptions are the domains where the logarithms are defined and the series converge.\n\nYes, so the main assumptions are about the domain of x to ensure the logarithms are defined and the series converge. Therefore, the formatted problem should include those two assumptions.",
