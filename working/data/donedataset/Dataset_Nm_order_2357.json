    "Content": "Let $L^p([0,1])$ denote the $L^p$ space with respect to Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. I want to show there is no bounded surjective linear operator $T \\colon L^{\\infty}([0,1]) \\to L^1([0,1])$ . The open mapping theorem says $T$ is maps open sets to open sets, but I'm not sure how that helps. I know how to prove this if $L^{\\infty}$ is replaced by $L^p$ for $1 < p < \\infty$ by looking at the adjoint map, but that doesn't work here since $(L^{\\infty})^{\\ast}$ is not separable",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma 1. Let $S:X\\to \\ell_1$ be surjective bounded operator. Then $X$ contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to $\\ell_1$ . proof. $S$ induces an isomorphism $\\hat{S}: X/ \\text{ker }S\\to \\ell_1$ . So there are $\\hat{x}_n\\in X$ s.t. $S\\hat{x}_n=e_n$ and $||\\hat{x}_n+\\text{ker } S||\\le ||\\hat{S}^{-1}||$ . It follows that there are $y_n\\in \\text{ker }S$ s.t. $||\\hat{x}_n+y_n||<||\\hat{S}^{-1}||+1$ . Put $x_n= \\hat{x}_n+y_n$ . Then $(x_n)$ is equivalent to the canonical base $(e_n)\\subset \\ell_1$ as follows: for each finitely supported $\\xi$ , $$||\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\xi(n)e_n||\\le ||S|| \\,||\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\xi(n) x_n||\\le ||S||(||\\hat{S}^{-1}+1)||\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\xi(n)e_n||$$ The subspace $F=\\overline{\\text{span}\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots\\}}$ is complemented by composing $S$ with the isomorphism $\\varphi:\\ell_1\\to F, e_n\\mapsto x_n$ . Lemma 2. $L_1[0,1]$ contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to $\\ell_1$ . proof. Consider a sequence of disjointly supported, normalized sequence $(f_n)\\subset L_1[0,1]$ . Lemma 3. If $E$ is an infinite dimensional complemented subspace of $L_\\infty$ , then $E$ is isomorphic to $L_\\infty$ . proof. see Kalton and Albiac's Topics in Banach Space Theory (2nd Edition), 4.3.10 and 5.7.5 Back to the question, suppose that there were some surjective $T:L_\\infty[0,1]\\to L_1[0,1]$ . Let $P:L_1[0,1]\\to \\ell_1$ be a surjective operator by lemma 2. Then $P\\circ T:L_\\infty[0,1]\\to\\ell_1$ is surjective. By Lemma 1, $L_\\infty$ contains a complemented copy of $\\ell_1$ . By Lemma 3, $\\ell_1$ would be isomorphic to $L_\\infty[0,1]$ , contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to show that there's no bounded surjective linear operator from L^∞([0,1]) to L^1([0,1]). The original question mentions using the open mapping theorem but the user isn't sure how. They also mention that replacing L^∞ with L^p for 1 < p < ∞ can be handled via adjoint maps, but since (L^∞)* isn't separable, that approach fails here.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. Let's break down the problem statement:\n\n1. The spaces involved are L^p([0,1]) with Lebesgue measure. So each L^p is defined on the unit interval with Lebesgue measure.\n2. The operator T is a linear operator from L^∞ to L^1.\n3. T is supposed to be bounded (i.e., continuous).\n4. T is surjective.\n5. The goal is to show such a T cannot exist.\n\nThe example provided in the user's question about the divisibility by 91 had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem is different. We need to list assumptions that are given or inherent in the problem.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the user states: \"Let L^p([0,1]) denote the L^p space with respect to Lebesgue measure on the unit interval.\" So that's a given. Then the operator T is between L^∞ and L^1, linear, bounded, surjective. The user wants to show no such T exists.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The domain is L^∞([0,1]) with Lebesgue measure.\n- The codomain is L^1([0,1]) with Lebesgue measure.\n- T is a linear operator.\n- T is bounded (continuous).\n- T is surjective.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So let's list each condition on T separately.\n\nAssumption:\n\n- T is a linear operator from L^∞([0,1]) to L^1([0,1]).\n- T is bounded.\n- T is surjective.\n\nAlso, the spaces are defined with Lebesgue measure on [0,1], which is an assumption about the spaces. So perhaps:\n\n- L^∞([0,1]) is the space of essentially bounded measurable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure.\n- L^1([0,1]) is the space of Lebesgue integrable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut maybe the first two points can be combined. Wait, the problem states \"Let L^p([0,1]) denote the L^p space with respect to Lebesgue measure on the unit interval.\" So that's the setting. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The space L^∞([0,1]) is considered with Lebesgue measure on [0,1].\n- The space L^1([0,1]) is considered with Lebesgue measure on [0,1].\n- T: L^∞([0,1]) → L^1([0,1]) is a linear operator.\n- T is bounded.\n- T is surjective.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to show that such a T cannot exist.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But here, the problem doesn't have such conditions; rather, the problem is to show that under the given conditions (T being bounded, linear, surjective between those spaces), such a T cannot exist. So the problem is to show that the assumptions (T being a bounded linear surjective operator between those spaces) lead to a contradiction, hence no such T exists.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are the properties that T is supposed to have, and the problem is to show that these cannot all hold. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions (each property of T and the spaces) and then state the problem as showing that no such T exists.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nL^∞([0,1]) is the space of essentially bounded measurable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure,\nL^1([0,1]) is the space of Lebesgue integrable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure,\nT: L^∞([0,1]) → L^1([0,1]) is a linear operator,\nT is bounded,\nT is surjective.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists no such operator T.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem says: \"I want to show there is no bounded surjective linear operator T: L^∞([0,1]) → L^1([0,1]).\" So the problem is to prove that such T does not exist. Therefore, the problem statement is to prove that no such T exists, given the spaces. The assumptions are the conditions that T would have to satisfy (linear, bounded, surjective) and the spaces (L^∞ and L^1 on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included the conditions on n. Here, the problem is about the non-existence of T under the given assumptions. So the assumptions should list the conditions that would have to hold if such a T existed, leading to the problem of showing that those conditions cannot all be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nL^∞([0,1]) is defined with respect to Lebesgue measure on [0,1],\nL^1([0,1]) is defined with respect to Lebesgue measure on [0,1],\nT is a linear operator from L^∞([0,1]) to L^1([0,1]),\nT is bounded,\nT is surjective.\n\nProblem:\nShow that no such operator T exists.\n\nBut the original problem says \"there is no bounded surjective linear operator\", so the problem is to show that such T does not exist. So the problem statement is to prove that no such T exists, given the spaces.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is the opposite: under the assumptions that T is linear, bounded, surjective, and between those spaces, we have to show that such T cannot exist. But the way the format is structured is to list the assumptions and then the problem. So the problem here is to show that under those assumptions, there's a contradiction, hence no such T exists. But perhaps the problem statement is \"Show that there is no bounded surjective linear operator T: L^∞([0,1]) → L^1([0,1])\", and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem (the spaces, etc.).\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\"\n\nThe example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and then the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is the actual statement to prove.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is to prove that there is no bounded surjective linear operator T from L^∞ to L^1. The problem mentions that L^p spaces are with Lebesgue measure on [0,1]. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The domain is L^∞([0,1]) with Lebesgue measure.\n\n- The codomain is L^1([0,1]) with Lebesgue measure.\n\n- T is a linear operator.\n\n- T is bounded.\n\n- T is surjective.\n\nBut since the problem is to show that such T does not exist, perhaps the problem statement is \"Show that no such operator T exists,\" and the assumptions are the conditions that T would have to meet (linear, bounded, surjective, between those spaces). Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as those conditions and the problem as showing that no such T exists.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nL^∞([0,1]) is the space of essentially bounded measurable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure,\nL^1([0,1]) is the space of Lebesgue integrable functions on [0,1] with Lebesgue measure,\nT: L^∞([0,1]) → L^1([0,1]) is a linear operator,\nT is bounded,\nT is surjective.\n\nProblem:\nShow that no such operator T exists.\n\nBut perhaps the first two assumptions can be combined into one line each. Wait, in the example, each assumption was a single line, each addressing one property applied to one object. So here, each line should be one assumption. Let me check:\n\n- The first assumption is about L^∞([0,1]) being defined with Lebesgue measure.\n\n- Second assumption about L^1([0,1]) similarly.\n\n- Third assumption is T being a linear operator between these spaces.\n\n- Fourth, T is bounded.\n\n- Fifth, T is surjective.\n\nSo each is a separate line. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\nL^∞([0,1]) is defined with Lebesgue measure on [0,1],\nL^1([0,1]) is defined with Lebesgue measure on [0,1],\nT is a linear operator from L^∞([0,1]) to L^1([0,1]),\nT is bounded,\nT is surjective.\n\nProblem:\nShow that no such operator T exists.\n\nThat seems correct. The problem is to show that under these assumptions, no such T can exist. The user wants to structure the problem in this way, separating the assumptions (the given conditions) and the problem statement. The original problem states that the user wants to show there's no such T, so the problem part is that assertion, and the assumptions are the setup.",
