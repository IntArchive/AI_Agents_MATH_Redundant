    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by looking at the example they provided to understand exactly how to extract the assumptions and problem statement.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was about proving that a certain expression A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted version lists two assumptions: that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user didn't mention that n needs to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake here. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is actually wrong? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo. Or maybe the user intended to modify the problem? Hmm, this might be confusing, but I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe current problem from Math Stack Exchange is titled: \"Show that ∫₀^∞ 1/(1+xⁿ) dx = π/(n sin(π/n)) where n is a positive integer.\" The question mentions using residues and a contour with R approaching infinity. The user tried the residue summation but their sum didn't converge.\n\nSo, to structure this into the required format, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem involves an integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(1+xⁿ) dx. The goal is to show this equals π/(n sin(π/n)). The original problem states that n is a positive integer. That's one assumption. Also, in the question, the user mentions using residues and a specific contour with R approaching infinity. However, in the problem statement itself, are there any hidden assumptions? For example, the integral is over real numbers, x is a real variable, n is a positive integer. The problem might require complex analysis, specifically contour integration, but that's part of the method, not the problem's assumption. Wait, but the problem is to show the equality. So the assumptions are the given conditions under which the problem holds. So the key assumptions here are that n is a positive integer. Are there more? For instance, maybe the integrand is considered in the real domain, but the problem doesn't specify any more conditions. The original problem statement is pretty straightforward. The user tried using residues and a contour, but the problem itself just states the integral equals that expression given n is a positive integer. So the main assumption is n is a positive integer. Are there any other implicit assumptions? For example, maybe that n ≥ 2? Wait, if n=1, the integral ∫₀^∞ 1/(1+x) dx diverges. But in the problem, n is a positive integer. However, when n=1, the right-hand side would be π/(1*sin(π/1)) = π/(sin π) which is undefined since sin π = 0. So the formula holds only when n ≥ 2. Wait, but the problem states n is a positive integer. Hmm, perhaps the original problem should have n ≥ 2? But the user's question says \"n is a positive integer\", but the formula would require n > 1. Maybe the problem as stated is incorrect for n=1, but the user might have a typo. However, the problem as presented in the title says \"n is a positive integer\". So according to the user's original problem, the assumption is n is a positive integer. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we should list that as the assumption, even though the formula might not hold for n=1. But perhaps the user intended n ≥ 2. But unless specified, we have to go with what's given. So the problem's assumption is n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumption is \"n is a positive integer\". So the problem is to show the integral equals that expression. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer\n\nThen the problem is to show that the integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(1+x^n) dx equals π/(n sin(π/n)).\n\nWait, but in the example, there was an added assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. But in this case, the original problem's assumption is clear. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^n} dx = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$$\n\nBut wait, the user's example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like a mistake in the example. So perhaps in the example, maybe the user intended to modify the problem? Because the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Maybe that was an error. But in any case, for the current problem, we need to stick to what's given.\n\nThe original problem's title is \"Show that ∫₀^∞ 1/(1+xⁿ) dx= π/(n sin(π/n)), where n is a positive integer.\" So the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that assumption.\n\nHowever, looking at the user's question part, they mention using residues and a contour with R approaching infinity. They attempted residue summation but their sum didn't converge. However, in the problem statement, the user is trying to evaluate the integral using contour integration. But the problem as stated in the title is just to show the equality, without specifying the method. Therefore, the problem's assumptions don't include the method (residues, contour), because those are part of the solution attempt, not the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^n} dx = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$$\n\nBut let me check again. The original problem states \"n is a positive integer\". There's no other conditions. Therefore, that's the only assumption. The problem is as stated. So that should be the formatted version.",
