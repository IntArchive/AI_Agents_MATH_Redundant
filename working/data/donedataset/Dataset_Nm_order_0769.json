    "Content": "A function f such that $$\n|f(x)-f(y)| \\leq C|x-y|\n$$ for all $x$ and $y$ , where $C$ is a constant independent of $x$ and $y$ , is called a Lipschitz function show that $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}\\hspace{3mm} \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R_{+}}$ isn't Lipschitz function Indeed,  there is no such constant C where $$\n|\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}| \\leq C|x-y| \\hspace{4mm} \\forall x,y \\in \\mathbb{R_{+}}\n$$ we have only that inequality $$\n|\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}|\\leq |\\sqrt{x}|+|\\sqrt{y}|\n$$ Am i right ? remark for @Vintarel  i plot it i don't know  graphically \"Lipschitz\" mean? \nwhat is the big deal in the graph of the square-root function in wikipedia they said Continuous functions that are not (globally) Lipschitz continuous The function f(x) = $\\sqrt{x}$ defined on [0, 1] is not Lipschitz continuous. This function becomes infinitely steep as x approaches 0 since its derivative becomes infinite. However, it is uniformly continuous as well as Hölder continuous of class $C^{0,\\alpha}$ , α for $α ≤ 1/2$ . Reference 1] could someone explain to me this by math and not by words, please ?? 2] what does \"Lipschitz\" mean graphically?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: why is it not possible to find a $C$ such that\n$$\n|\\sqrt{x} - \\sqrt{0}|\\leq C|x-0|\n$$\nFor all $x \\geq 0$? As a general rule: Note that a differentiable function will necessarily be Lipschitz on any interval on which its derivative is bounded. In response to the wikipedia excerpt: \"This function becomes infinitely steep as $x$ approaches $0$\" is another way of saying that $f'(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to 0$. If you look at slope of the tangent line at each $x$ as $x$ gets closer to $0$,  those tangent lines become steeper and steeper, approaching a vertical tangent at $x = 0$. \"Graphically\", we can say that a differentiable function will be Lipschitz (if and) only if it never has a vertical tangent line. Some functions that are not Lipschitz due to an unbounded derivative: $$\nf(x) = x^{1/3}\\\\\nf(x) = x^{1/n},\\quad n = 2,3,4,5,\\dots\n$$\nA more subtle example:\n$$\nf(x) = x^2,\\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\\\\nf(x) = \\sin(x^2), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nNote in these cases that although $f'(x)$ is continuous, there is no upper bound for $f'(x)$ over the domain of interest.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the square root function f(x) = √x isn't Lipschitz on ℝ₊. The key here is understanding the definition of a Lipschitz function. A Lipschitz function has a bounded derivative, right? Because the Lipschitz constant C is essentially the maximum slope between any two points. But wait, the derivative of √x is 1/(2√x), which approaches infinity as x approaches 0. That suggests that near zero, the function becomes infinitely steep, so there's no single constant C that can satisfy the Lipschitz condition for all x and y in ℝ₊.\n\nThe user mentioned that they know the inequality |√x - √y| ≤ |√x| + |√y|, but that's just the triangle inequality. That doesn't help because it doesn't provide a bound in terms of |x - y|. The Lipschitz condition requires the difference in function values to be proportional to the difference in inputs. \n\nTo formally prove it, assume for contradiction that there exists a constant C such that |√x - √y| ≤ C|x - y| for all x, y ≥ 0. Let's set y = 0. Then the inequality becomes √x ≤ Cx. Dividing both sides by √x (assuming x > 0), we get 1 ≤ C√x. But as x approaches 0, the right side approaches 0, which contradicts the inequality. Therefore, no such C exists.\n\nRegarding the graphical interpretation, a Lipschitz function can't have parts that are too steep. The square root function gets steeper as it approaches x=0, making the slope unbounded. So graphically, the function's slope becomes vertical near the origin, which violates the Lipschitz condition since the steepness isn't bounded by any constant C.\n\nThe Hölder continuity part with α ≤ 1/2 comes from the fact that |√x - √y| ≤ |x - y|^{1/2} / (2√(min(x,y))), but that's another topic. For the problem at hand, focusing on the derivative or the specific choice of y=0 should suffice to show it's not Lipschitz.",
