    "Content": "We know that in a Dedekind domain, every nonzero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals. I was wondering if this condition is sufficient for a domain to be Dedekind, i.e., if in a domain $D$ every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then is the domain Dedekind? It seems that \"Noetherianness\" of $D$ follows (via the ascending chain condition) if we can show that every non-zero prime ideal of $D$ is maximal. But, I don't know how to prove the latter assertion. Perhaps, one needs Noetherianness of $D$ to prove that $D$ is a dimension $1$ domain. Any help or hint would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Jacobson's Basic Algebra , volume II (second edition) has: Definition. A domain $D$ is called a Dedekind domain if every $D$ -fractional ideal of $F$ (the field of fractions of $D$ ) is invertible. Theorem. (Theorem 10.6, page 630) Let $D$ be a domain. The following are equivalent: $D$ is Dedekind. $D$ is integrally closed, noetherian, and every nonzero prime ideal of $D$ is maximal. Every proper integral ideal of $D$ can be written in one and only one way as a product of prime ideals. $D$ is noetherian and $D_P$ is a discrete valuation ring for every maximal ideal $P$ in $D$ . The proof that 3 implies 1 is credited to Zariski and Samuel: First, every invertible prime $P$ of $D$ is maximal in $D$ ; let $a\\in D-P$ , and assume that $aD+P\\neq D$ ; then $aD+P$ can be written as a product of primes, $$aD+P = P_1\\cdots P_m$$ and likewise, $a^2D+P\\neq D$ so $$a^2D+P = Q_1\\cdots Q_n$$ Since $P$ is properly contained in both $aD+P$ and in $a^2D+P$ , then $P$ is properly contained in each of the $P_i$ and each of the $Q_j$ . Now look at $D/P$ , which is also a domain, and in which $\\overline{aD} = \\overline{P_1}\\cdots\\overline{P_m}$ and $\\overline{a^2D}=\\overline{Q_1}\\cdots \\overline{Q_n}$ . The principal ideals $\\overline{aD}$ and $\\overline{a^2D}$ are invertible, and $\\overline{P_i}$ and $\\overline{Q_j}$ are prime ideals. Since $\\overline{a^2D} = \\overline{a}^2\\overline{D}=(\\overline{aD})^2 = \\overline{P_1}^2\\cdots\\overline{P_n}^2$ , and  since factorizations for invertible integral ideals are unique, $\\{\\overline{P_1},\\overline{P_1},\\ldots,\\overline{P_n},\\overline{P_n}\\}$ is the same sequence as $\\{\\overline{Q_1},\\ldots,\\overline{Q_m}\\}$ , except perhaps for the order. Hence, the corresponding sequences of ideals of $D$ that contain $P$ , $\\{P_1,P_1,\\ldots,P_n,P_n\\}$ and $\\{Q_1,\\ldots,Q_m\\}$ are the same up to order. Hence $(aD+P)^2 = a^2D+P$ , so $$P\\subseteq (aD+P)^2 = a^2D+aP+P^2 \\subseteq aD+P^2.$$ So if $p\\in P$ , then $p=ax+y$ with $x\\in D$ and $y\\in P^2$ ; hence $ax\\in P$ , and since $a\\notin D$ , then $x\\in P$ .  So $P\\subseteq aP+P^2\\subseteq P$ , so $P=aP+P^2$ . Since we are assuming $P$ is invertible, then $D = P^{-1}P = P^{-1}(aP+P^2) = aD+P$ , a contradiction. So $aD+P = D$ for every $a\\notin P$ , hence $P$ is maximal. Now let $P$ be any nonzero prime ideal, and let $b\\neq 0$ be an element of $P$ . So $bD\\subseteq P$ and $bD=P_1P_2\\cdots P_m$ where the $P_i$ are prime and are invertible. So the $P_i$ are maximal. Since $P$ is prime, $P_i\\subseteq P$ for some $i$ ; hence $P=P_i$ , so $P$ is invertible. Since every proper ideal is a product of primes, and every prime is invertible, it follows that every integral ideal is invertible. Given a fractional ideal $I'=aI$ , with $I$ integral and $a\\neq 0$ , we have $I'(I')^{-1}=II^{-1}=D$ , so every fractional ideal is invertible. $\\Box$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user is asking whether a domain where every nonzero ideal has a unique factorization into prime ideals is necessarily Dedekind. I remember that Dedekind domains are characterized by being Noetherian, integrally closed, and of dimension one, where every nonzero ideal factors uniquely into primes. So the question is if the unique factorization alone is enough.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that D is a domain where every non-zero ideal has a unique factorization into prime ideals. The user mentions that Noetherianness might follow from the ascending chain condition, but they're stuck on showing every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. They also mention that proving dimension one might require Noetherianness. So the key points here are the domain D, the unique factorization into primes for every ideal, and needing to verify the three Dedekind properties.\n\nNow, structuring the problem. The original question is whether this condition is sufficient. So the assumptions should be the properties given: D is a domain, every nonzero ideal in D factors uniquely into prime ideals. Then the problem is to determine if D is Dedekind. Wait, but the user's own analysis mentions that they need to show every non-zero prime is maximal (i.e., dimension one) and that D is Noetherian. The question is whether the given condition implies these.\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list each condition given. The domain D, every nonzero ideal has unique prime factorization. The problem is to prove if D is Dedekind. But in the example provided, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are the properties of the domain D. So each assumption line should state one property. The first line would be \"D is a domain\", the second line \"Every non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals\". Then the problem is to determine whether D is Dedekind. However, the user's problem seems to be phrased as a question, so maybe the problem statement is \"Is D a Dedekind domain?\" or \"Prove or disprove that D is Dedekind.\"\n\nWait, the original question says: \"if in a domain D every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then is the domain Dedekind?\" So that's the problem. So the assumptions are the conditions on D, and the problem is whether D must be Dedekind.\n\nBut the user also mentions their own thoughts: that Noetherianness might follow via ACC if they can show every non-zero prime is maximal. They need help with that step. But the formatted problem should just state the problem as given, not the user's thoughts. So the assumptions are D is a domain, and every non-zero ideal factors uniquely into primes. The problem is to prove D is Dedekind.\n\nI should check if there are more assumptions. For example, is the domain commutative? Well, Dedekind domains are commutative, but the problem says \"domain\" which usually is commutative. So perhaps the only assumptions are that D is a domain (so commutative ring with 1, no zero divisors) and every non-zero ideal has unique factorization into primes. Then the problem is to prove that D is Dedekind. So the formatted problem should have those two assumptions, each on a separate line.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"domain\" is already an assumption, so:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a domain,\nEvery non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nProblem:\nIs D a Dedekind domain?\n\nAlternatively, since the user is trying to prove it, maybe the problem is \"Prove that D is a Dedekind domain.\"\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"if in a domain D..., then is the domain Dedekind?\" So the problem is to determine whether the implication holds. So perhaps the problem is \"Prove or disprove: If D is a domain where every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then D is Dedekind.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove the divisibility. So here, perhaps the problem is to prove that D is Dedekind. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a domain,\nEvery non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D is a Dedekind domain.\n\nBut the user also mentions that they don't know how to prove that every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. So the key is to show that D is Noetherian, has dimension one, and is integrally closed. Wait, but in the problem statement, does the unique factorization of ideals into primes imply that D is integrally closed? Because in a Dedekind domain, unique factorization holds, but the converse requires more. Hmm, but maybe under the given conditions, D must be Dedekind.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is yes. Because if every ideal factors uniquely into primes, then the ring is Noetherian (since every ideal is finitely generated, as in factorization requires finite products), and then if every prime ideal is maximal (dimension one), and perhaps integrally closed. Wait, but how does unique factorization of ideals imply integrally closed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is no, and there exists a domain with unique factorization of ideals into primes that isn't Dedekind. But I think that in fact, the property that every ideal factors into primes is equivalent to being a Dedekind domain. Wait, the standard theorem is that a Dedekind domain is a Noetherian integrally closed domain of dimension one, and in such a domain, every ideal factors uniquely into primes. Conversely, if a domain has every ideal factor into primes, then it is Dedekind. But maybe that requires the domain to be Noetherian and of dimension one. Wait, perhaps the user is correct that the unique factorization implies Noetherian (since each ideal is a finite product of primes, hence finitely generated), and then one has to show that the dimension is one, which requires showing every non-zero prime is maximal. Also, is the ring integrally closed? That might not follow from unique factorization. So perhaps the answer is no; that is, there exists a domain where every ideal factors uniquely into primes, but which isn't integrally closed, hence not Dedekind. But I'm not sure. This might be a known result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is yes. For example, in the paper \"Unique factorization of ideals\" by Jesse Elliott, maybe such domains are characterized. But perhaps the answer is yes, that the condition is sufficient. Wait, in the standard literature, a domain in which every ideal is a product of prime ideals is called a general ZPI-ring (Zerlegung Primideale). A Dedekind domain is a ZPI-domain where every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. So a general ZPI-ring might have dimension greater than one. But in the problem, the assumption is unique factorization, which might require that the prime ideals are in some sense \"independent\", so that the factorization is unique. So in a general ZPI-ring, factorization might not be unique unless it's a Dedekind domain. Wait, according to some sources, a domain is a ZPI-ring if every ideal can be expressed as a product of prime ideals. A Dedekind domain is a ZPI-domain where every ideal is uniquely a product of primes. Wait, but maybe in a ZPI-domain, if the factorization is unique, then it must be Dedekind. So perhaps the answer is yes, that the domain must be Dedekind. Hence, the problem is to prove that if D is a domain where every non-zero ideal factors uniquely into primes, then D is Dedekind.\n\nBut regardless of the answer, the formatted problem should capture the original question. The original question is: if in a domain D every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then is the domain Dedekind? So the assumptions are D is a domain, every non-zero ideal in D has unique factorization into primes, and the problem is whether D is Dedekind. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a domain,\nEvery non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nProblem:\nIs D a Dedekind domain?\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the problem was stated as \"Prove that...\", even though the original question was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original question is phrased as a yes/no question. However, the user is asking for help in proving it, suggesting they believe the answer is yes. But the formatted problem should reflect the original question's structure. The example given by the user took a problem that was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and formatted it with assumptions and the problem. In the current case, the original problem is \"Is the domain Dedekind?\" So the problem statement should be \"Is D a Dedekind domain?\" However, in the example, the user's own example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (that n is divisible by 7), but here, the original problem's assumptions are already given. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, but the user provided it. However, for the current problem, we need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Let me check. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they list assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would restrict n to multiples of 7, which is not the original problem. So the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we need to follow their instruction regardless. So in their example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That suggests that maybe the user's approach to formatting includes extracting implicit assumptions. Wait, but in the original problem, there's no restriction on n other than being an integer. The formatted problem in the example incorrectly added that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake there, but in their instructions, they said \"filtered the unrelated informations\". Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it? For example, maybe the original problem had a different divisibility condition. But as per the given example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n)... is divisible by 91\", and the formatted problem lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. So perhaps the user intended to have a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. That is confusing. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but they want us to follow their format regardless.\n\nBut given that, for the current problem, the user's question is: if in a domain D every non-zero ideal admits a unique factorization into a product of prime ideals, then is D Dedekind? So the assumptions are D is a domain, every non-zero ideal has unique factorization into primes. The problem is to determine if D is Dedekind. Therefore, following the example (even if flawed), the assumptions should list each condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a domain,\nEvery non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nProblem:\nIs D a Dedekind domain?\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to prove that D is Dedekind, then the problem statement would be \"Prove that D is a Dedekind domain.\" The original question is phrased as a yes/no question, but the user is seeking to prove it, so perhaps the problem is to prove the statement. The user writes: \"It seems that 'Noetherianness' of D follows... But, I don't know how to prove the latter assertion. Perhaps, one needs Noetherianness of D to prove that D is a dimension 1 domain.\" So they want help in proving that D is Dedekind, assuming the two conditions. Therefore, the problem is to prove that D is Dedekind.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nD is a domain,\nEvery non-zero ideal of D can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D is a Dedekind domain.\n\nThat seems correct. The user's own analysis is about how to establish Noetherianness and dimension one. The key points for a Dedekind domain are: Noetherian, integrally closed, dimension one. So the problem is to show that under the given assumptions, D satisfies these three properties.",
