    "Content": "Let $\\{s_n\\}$ and $\\{t_n\\}$ be sequences. I've noticed this inequality in a few analysis textbooks that I have come across, so I've started to think this can't be a typo: $\\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} s_n + \\liminf\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} t_n \\leq \\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (s_n + t_n) \\leq \\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} s_n + \\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} t_n$. I understand the right two-thirds of the equation, and can prove it.  I'm stuck on the far-left third.  I don't understand how that is true.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will write only about the first inequality $$\\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} s_n + \\liminf\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} t_n \\leq \\limsup\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (s_n + t_n).$$ (You wrote that you can prove the rest.) By definition, if $\\liminf t_n=t$ then for each $\\varepsilon>0$ the inequality $t_n>t-\\varepsilon$ holds for all but finitely many $n$'s.\nFor such $n$'s we also have $s_n+t_n>s_n+t-\\varepsilon$ and\n$$\\limsup(s_n+t_n) \\ge \\limsup (s_n+t-\\varepsilon) = t-\\varepsilon+ \\limsup (s_n).$$\n(We have used monotonicity of $\\limsup$ and that $\\limsup (C+x_n)=C+\\limsup x_n$ for any constant $C$.)\nSince the above inequality is true for each $\\varepsilon>0$, we get that\n$$\\limsup(s_n+t_n) \\ge t + \\limsup (s_n)=\\liminf t_n+\\limsup s_n.$$ EDIT: Note that the above proof does not work for $t=-\\infty$ (it does not make sense to write $-\\infty-\\varepsilon$), but in this case the inequality is clear. (Of course, we have to omit indeterminate case $\\infty-\\infty$, i.e., in this case we assume that $\\limsup s_n$ is finite.)

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example has a typo. But regardless, I need to follow the user's format as per their instructions.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is from Math Stack Exchange: the question is about the inequality involving lim sup and lim inf of sequences. The user provided the title and the question. The title mentions \"Properties of liminf and limsup of sum of sequences: limsup s_n + liminf t_n ≤ limsup (s_n + t_n) ≤ limsup s_n + limsup t_n\". The question states that the user noticed this inequality in textbooks and is confused about the left part, the limsup s_n + liminf t_n ≤ limsup (s_n + t_n).\n\nSo, the task is to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. The assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. The problem is to state the inequality that needs to be proven, particularly focusing on the left third which the user is stuck on.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The original problem is about sequences {s_n} and {t_n}. The problem involves lim sup and lim inf of these sequences. Are there any implicit assumptions here? Well, typically in analysis, when dealing with lim sup and lim inf, the sequences are assumed to be real-valued, and the lim sup and lim inf exist (they could be infinite, but in many textbooks, they might be working within the extended real numbers). But the question as stated doesn't specify any restrictions on the sequences beyond being sequences. So, the assumptions would be that {s_n} and {t_n} are sequences of real numbers. Also, possibly that their lim sup and lim inf exist (but maybe that's redundant because lim sup and lim inf always exist in the extended reals). However, the problem might not state any specific conditions beyond that. So perhaps the only assumptions are that {s_n} and {t_n} are real sequences.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement doesn't mention any specific conditions on the sequences. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond {s_n} and {t_n} being sequences. However, to be safe, perhaps list the assumptions as:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- {t_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one object. Then the problem is to prove the inequality involving lim sup and lim inf.\n\nBut the original problem mentions the inequality as:\n\nlim sup s_n + lim inf t_n ≤ lim sup (s_n + t_n) ≤ lim sup s_n + lim sup t_n\n\nSo the problem statement is to prove this inequality. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the sequences are real, and the problem is to prove the given inequality.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they added an assumption that wasn't present in the original problem. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. But maybe the example was a mistake. However, the user's instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". So perhaps in some cases, assumptions might be implicit in the problem but not stated. But in the current case, the problem is about sequences in general. There are no specific conditions given on the sequences except that they are sequences. So perhaps the only assumptions are that s_n and t_n are real sequences. Unless there's an implicit condition that the lim sup and lim inf are finite. For example, if lim sup s_n is infinity, then adding it to lim inf t_n (which could be -infty) might not be well-defined. But in analysis textbooks, when such inequalities are presented, they often assume that the lim sups and lim infs are finite unless specified otherwise. But the problem statement here doesn't specify that. However, to avoid dealing with extended real number arithmetic complexities, maybe the assumption is that all lim sups and lim infs involved are finite. But the problem statement as given doesn't state that. So perhaps the user's intended format is to list all the necessary assumptions, even if they are implicit.\n\nBut in the absence of explicit conditions, how to proceed? The problem is as stated. The user is referring to the inequality from textbooks, so likely the standard conditions apply. Typically, in such inequalities, the sequences are real, and the expressions are assumed to be defined (i.e., not indeterminate forms like ∞ - ∞). Therefore, the assumptions would be that {s_n} and {t_n} are real sequences, and that the lim sup and lim inf involved are finite. But the problem as stated doesn't mention this. However, since the user is following an example where assumptions were listed even if not present in the original problem (like adding n divisible by 7 when original problem said for all integers), maybe in this case, we need to list the necessary assumptions for the inequality to hold.\n\nBut according to standard analysis, the inequality lim sup s_n + lim inf t_n ≤ lim sup (s_n + t_n) holds provided that the right-hand side is defined. That would require that s_n + t_n is defined (so sequences are real), and that the lim sup of s_n + t_n exists. But since we are working in the extended reals, lim sup always exists. However, for the inequality to make sense in the real numbers, we might need that the left-hand side is not ∞ - ∞ or similar. So, for the left part lim sup s_n + lim inf t_n ≤ lim sup (s_n + t_n), if lim sup s_n is ∞ and lim inf t_n is -∞, the left-hand side would be undefined (∞ + (-∞)), so perhaps the assumption is that the sum lim sup s_n + lim inf t_n is defined. So that would mean that we don't have ∞ + (-∞) or similar indeterminate forms. Similarly, on the right side, lim sup (s_n + t_n) ≤ lim sup s_n + lim sup t_n, this requires that the right-hand side is defined, i.e., not ∞ - ∞.\n\nBut how does the original problem state this? The user says they saw this inequality in analysis textbooks, so likely the textbooks have standard assumptions. In many textbooks, such inequalities are presented under the assumption that all the lim sups and lim infs are finite. Alternatively, they may state the inequality in the extended real numbers with the caveat that indeterminate forms are excluded.\n\nHowever, since the problem as presented by the user does not specify any conditions, but just says \"Let {s_n} and {t_n} be sequences\", and the inequality, perhaps the assumptions to list are:\n\n- {s_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- {t_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n- The lim sup and lim inf of {s_n} are real numbers (i.e., finite).\n- The lim sup and lim inf of {t_n} are real numbers.\n\nBut I need to check standard references. For example, the inequality lim sup (s_n + t_n) ≤ lim sup s_n + lim sup t_n holds provided that the right-hand side is not ∞ - ∞. Similarly, the left inequality lim sup s_n + lim inf t_n ≤ lim sup (s_n + t_n) requires that lim sup s_n + lim inf t_n is defined (i.e., not ∞ - ∞). So perhaps the assumptions should be that lim sup s_n and lim sup t_n are not infinity, and lim inf t_n is not negative infinity, etc., but this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in a context where all the lim sups and lim infs are finite. So the user's task is to structure the problem as per the format. Given that the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions, but given that the inequality is presented in textbooks, perhaps the standard assumptions are that {s_n} and {t_n} are bounded sequences, ensuring that lim sup and lim inf are finite. But again, the problem doesn't state that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond {s_n} and {t_n} being real sequences, and the problem is to prove the inequality under those conditions, with the caveat that the expressions are defined. However, in the user's example, assumptions were listed even if not present in the original problem, so maybe here we should list that {s_n} and {t_n} are real sequences.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example had the user add an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake in the example, but perhaps the user intended that. However, in this current problem, the user is presenting a general inequality for any sequences {s_n} and {t_n}, so the only assumptions are that they are real sequences, and perhaps that the necessary lim sup and lim inf are finite. But since the problem is stated generally, maybe the assumptions are just that {s_n} and {t_n} are real sequences.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n{s_n} is a sequence of real numbers,\n{t_n} is a sequence of real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} s_n + \\liminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} t_n \\leq \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (s_n + t_n) \\leq \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} s_n + \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} t_n.$$\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as two separate lines. So each assumption is on a separate line. So here, {s_n} is a sequence, and {t_n} is a sequence. Each as separate assumptions.\n\nI think that's the correct approach here. The problem doesn't specify any further conditions, so the assumptions are just that both are real sequences. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those two assumptions and then state the problem as proving the inequality.",
