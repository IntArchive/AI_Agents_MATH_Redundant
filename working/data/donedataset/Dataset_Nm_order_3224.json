    "Content": "My question is in the title. I'm a little lost in how to solve this problem. There is a hint associated with the problem that states the following: Use a line integral to show that $ |f(z)| \\leq A + |z| $ where A = $\\max\\{1, |f(0)|\\}$ Thanks for the help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may as well suppose $|f(z)| > 1$ Take the line $[0,z]$ and let $d = \\sup \\{ w : w\\in (0,z), |f(w)| \\leq 1\\}$ and $d = 0$ if this set is empty.  Then $|f'(z)| \\leq 1$ on $[d,z]$. Then $$ |z| \\geq |z - d| \\geq \\int_d^z |f'(w)| dw \\geq \\left|\\int_d^z f'(w) dw \\right| = |f(z) - f(d)| $$ Now $|f(d)| = \\max \\{ |f(0)|, 1 \\}$.  Because of the inequality $|a - b| \\geq ||a| - |b|| \\geq |a| - |b|$, we therefore have $|z| + |f(d)| \\geq |f(z)|$ Excuse the notation, once I restrict to the line $[0,z]$, I borrow a lot of the language from real numbers over.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The problem states that f is entire, meaning it's analytic everywhere on the complex plane. The condition given is that for each z, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1. We need to prove that f is a linear polynomial, so degree 1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the problem correctly. The user wants me to structure it into Assumptions and Problem parts. The example given had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let me start by extracting the key information.\n\nOriginal problem: Suppose that f is entire and that for each z, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1. Prove that f is a linear polynomial.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is entire. (That's one property of the function f)\n2. For every z, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1. (This is a condition that applies to each z; for each point, at least one of the two inequalities holds)\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a linear polynomial, i.e., f(z) = az + b, where a and b are constants.\n\nWait, the example had assumptions split into separate lines. For instance, in the example, they had \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So here, each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one condition on one object.\n\nSo, translating the original problem into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nf is entire,\nFor each complex number z, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is a linear polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title says \"Suppose that f is entire and that for each z, either |f(z)| ≤1 or |f’(z)| ≤1. Prove that f is a linear polynomial.\"\n\nSo, the two assumptions are f being entire and the condition on each z. So each of these would be separate lines under Assumption.\n\nBut in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, but in the original example, the formatted assumption added an extra condition that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they split it into two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like maybe the example was from a different problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example's original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that doesn't align. Wait, the original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't add that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was from a different problem where n is both an integer and divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the instruction is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo in the current problem, the two main assumptions are:\n\n1. f is entire.\n2. For each z ∈ ℂ, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1.\n\nThese are two separate conditions, so each should be a separate line under Assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f is a linear polynomial.\n\nAdditionally, the user provided a question where the original poster mentions a hint about using a line integral to show |f(z)| ≤ A + |z| with A = max{1, |f(0)|}. But the problem itself doesn't include the hint; the title includes the problem statement. So when formatting, we should focus on the problem as stated in the title, not the extra information in the question body unless necessary. The user instructions say to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated information\".\n\nSo the title is: Suppose that $ f $ is entire and that for each $ z $, either $ |f(z)| \\leq 1 $ or $ |f^\\prime (z) |\\leq 1 $. Prove that $ f $ is a linear polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the two assumptions as above.\n\nI need to check if there are any hidden assumptions or if I'm missing something. The problem doesn't mention anything else. So the Assumption section should list:\n\n- f is entire.\n- For each z, either |f(z)| ≤ 1 or |f’(z)| ≤ 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove f is linear.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is entire,\nFor each complex number z, either $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ or $|f'(z)| \\leq 1$.\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is a linear polynomial.",
