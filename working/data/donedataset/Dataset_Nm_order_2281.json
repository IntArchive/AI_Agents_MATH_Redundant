    "Content": "$\\newcommand{\\RP}{\\mathbf RP}$\nThe real projective plane $\\RP^2$ is defined as the quotient space $S^2/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ identifies the antipodal points of $S^2$. I want to show that $\\RP^2$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the closed $2$-disc $D^2$ obtained by identifying the antipodal points on the boundary circle of $D^2$. This is not at all visually obvious to me. An analogous problem is showing that $\\RP^1=S^1$. Here, the situation is simple because we can think of $S^1$ as sitting inside $\\mathbf C$ and consider the function $f:S^1\\to S^1$ defined as $f(z)=z^2$ for all $z\\in S^1$. The fibres of $f$ are precisely the antipodal points and we get an isomorphism $S^1/\\sim \\ \\cong \\ S^1$. Again, the simpler case is also not visually clear to me.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Every point on the upper hemisphere is identified with a point on the lower one. The upper hemisphere is homeomorphic to a disc. What happens at the equator ( the boundary of this disc)? edit: Let's do a proof. Let $D^2$ be the disc and $D^2/\\sim$ the disc with opposite boundary points identified. For every point $x\\in S^2$ there are two points on the line through the origin and $x$. For all points outside the equator, there is a unique point on the upper hemisphere, but on the equator there are two points on the (closed) upper hemisphere. We can't directly define a map $S^2\\rightarrow D^2$ this way, however we can map a point to $D^2/\\sim$. The problems on the equator disappear when we take the equivalence relation. Thus we have a map $S^2\\rightarrow D^2/\\sim$. By definition of this map it sends antipodal points on $S^2$ to the same points on $D^2/\\sim$. Hence it factors to a continuous map $\\mathbb{RP}^2\\rightarrow D^2/\\sim$. Now you have to show that this map is injective surjective and that $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ is compact, and $D^2/\\sim$ is Hausdorff. Then you know that the map is a homeomorphism (see https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Continuous_Bijection_from_Compact_to_Hausdorff_is_Homeomorphism ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to show that the real projective plane RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the closed 2-disc D² obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary. The original definition of RP² is the quotient of S² under antipodal identification. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's parse the problem:\n\n1. The real projective plane RP² is defined as S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n2. The task is to show RP² is homeomorphic to another quotient space: D² with antipodal points on its boundary identified.\n3. The boundary of D² is a circle (S¹), so the identification is on S¹.\n4. The problem mentions an analogous case with RP¹, which is S¹/~, shown to be homeomorphic to S¹ via the map z → z². But this example might not be directly part of the assumptions for the current problem.\n\nSo the key objects here are S² with antipodal quotient, D² with antipodal boundary quotient, and the goal is to establish a homeomorphism between them. The assumptions should cover the definitions of both spaces involved. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is the quotient space S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- D² is the closed 2-dimensional disc.\n- The boundary of D² is a circle S¹.\n- The quotient space in question is obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary S¹ of D².\n\nEach of these is a single assumption about one object. Now, the problem is to show that RP² is homeomorphic to this quotient space of D². \n\nWait, the original problem states \"the quotient space of the closed 2-disc D² obtained by identifying the antipodal points on the boundary circle of D²\". So the problem is to prove RP² is homeomorphic to D²/~ where ~ is antipodal on the boundary. So the assumptions should list the definitions of both spaces. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a condition on the objects in the problem. Here, the objects are S², D², their respective equivalence relations. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. RP² is the quotient space S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n2. The problem considers another quotient space: D² with antipodal points on its boundary identified.\n\nWait, but how to phrase each as a single line. Let me think:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is defined as the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points of S².\n- D² is the closed 2-dimensional disc.\n- The boundary of D² is homeomorphic to S¹.\n- Antipodal points on the boundary of D² are identified via an equivalence relation ~'.\n\nThen the problem is to show that RP² is homeomorphic to D²/~'. But maybe the problem can be phrased without explicitly defining ~' if the problem statement mentions it. Let me refer back to the original question. The user wrote: \"show that RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the closed 2-disc D² obtained by identifying the antipodal points on the boundary circle of D².\" So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The quotient space D²/~' is formed by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of the closed 2-disc D².\n\nBut each assumption must address only one property applied to one object. So splitting them:\n\n1. RP² is the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points of S².\n2. D² is the closed 2-dimensional disc.\n3. The boundary of D² is a circle S¹.\n4. The equivalence relation ~' identifies antipodal points on the boundary of D².\n\nBut maybe the problem statement already includes the definition of the D² quotient. Alternatively, since the problem is to compare RP² (defined as S²/~) with D²/~', the key assumptions are the definitions of the two spaces. However, in the example given, the assumptions included the conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions are the definitions of the two quotient spaces. So each definition is an assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is defined as the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The quotient space D²/~' is defined by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of the closed 2-disc D².\n\nBut the user's example split the assumptions into two lines for n. So here, each line is one assumption. But \"D²/~' is defined by...\" might combine two things: D² is a closed 2-disc, and the equivalence relation is on its boundary. But the problem is to structure the problem, not necessarily the entire solution. The user's example included the problem statement with the structure. The key is to extract the necessary conditions or definitions that are given in the problem.\n\nOriginal problem statement says: \"show that RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space of the closed 2-disc D² obtained by identifying the antipodal points on the boundary circle of D².\" So the problem is given that RP² is S²/~ (antipodal), and the other space is D² with antipodal boundary points identified. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. RP² is the quotient space S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n2. The other space is the quotient of D² by identifying antipodal points on its boundary.\n\nBut each assumption must be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is the quotient space S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The quotient space is formed by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of the closed 2-disc D².\n\nThen the problem is to show that RP² is homeomorphic to this quotient space. The problem in the example had the problem line restate the expression and the divisibility. Here, the problem line would be \"Prove that RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space of D² obtained by identifying antipodal boundary points.\"\n\nWait, but maybe more precise. The problem is to show that RP² (as defined by S²/~) is homeomorphic to D²/~', where ~' is antipodal on the boundary. So the problem line should capture that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is defined as the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The closed 2-disc D² has a boundary circle S¹.\n- Antipodal points on the boundary of D² are identified via an equivalence relation.\n\nProblem:\nProve that RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space D²/~ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary of D².\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the original question is exactly that. So the assumptions are the definitions of RP² and the construction of the D² quotient. Each line in assumption should be a single condition. So the first assumption is the definition of RP². The second is the definition of the D² quotient. However, the D² quotient involves two parts: D² is a closed 2-disc, and the equivalence relation is on its boundary. But how to split into single-line assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is the quotient space of S² by identifying antipodal points.\n- The quotient space in question is obtained from the closed 2-disc D² by identifying antipodal points on its boundary.\n\nBut the example given had two assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Each on separate lines. So here, each part of the problem's setup is an assumption. The problem is to show RP² (defined as S²/~) is homeomorphic to D²/~' (defined as D² with antipodal boundary points). So the assumptions are the definitions of both spaces. Therefore, structuring as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is defined as the quotient space S²/~, where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The closed 2-disc D² is considered with its boundary circle.\n- The equivalence relation on D² identifies antipodal points on its boundary.\n\nProblem:\nProve that RP² is homeomorphic to the quotient space D²/~.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third assumption is merged into the second, but per the example's style, each condition is separate. However, the equivalence relation on D² is part of the problem's setup. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real projective plane RP² is the quotient space S²/~ where ~ identifies antipodal points.\n- The quotient space of D² is formed by identifying antipodal points on its boundary.\n\nEach of these is a single line. The first defines RP², the second defines the D² quotient. Then the problem is to show they are homeomorphic. Yes, that seems right. So the answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\nThe real projective plane $\\RP^2$ is defined as the quotient space $S^2/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ identifies antipodal points.\nThe quotient space of the closed $2$-disc $D^2$ is obtained by identifying antipodal points on its boundary circle.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\RP^2$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space of $D^2$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary.",
