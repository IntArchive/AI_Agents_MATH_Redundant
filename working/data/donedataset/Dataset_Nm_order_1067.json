    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the Lie derivative of a vector field equals the Lie bracket. The formula given is the derivative at t=0 of the pushforward of Y by the flow of X at time -t, which should equal [X,Y]. The user mentioned that the problem is from some online notes.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions. The problem mentions that X and Y are vector fields on a smooth manifold M. The flow phi_t is associated with X, meaning that the derivative of phi_t(p) with respect to t is X_p. These are the key elements. Also, the Lie bracket [X,Y] is defined as the commutator X∘Y - Y∘X. \n\nEach assumption should be a separate line. So, the assumptions are:\n- X is a vector field on M\n- Y is a vector field on M\n- phi_t is the flow of X (so derivative of phi_t(p) is X_p at t=0)\n- The Lie bracket [X,Y] is defined as X∘Y - Y∘X\n\nWait, the definition of the Lie bracket here is important. The problem states that [X,Y] is the commutator defined by X∘Y - Y∘X. However, sometimes the Lie bracket is defined using the Lie derivative, but here it's given as the commutator of differential operators. So that's an assumption about how the Lie bracket is defined in this context.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each of these conditions. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\n- $X$ is a vector field on a smooth manifold $M$,\n- $Y$ is a vector field on $M$,\n- $\\phi_t$ is the flow of $X$ (i.e., $\\frac{d}{dt} \\phi_t(p) = X_{\\phi_t(p)}$ for $p \\in M$),\n- The Lie bracket $[X, Y]$ is defined as $X \\circ Y - Y \\circ X$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( (\\phi_{-t})_* Y \\right)\\big|_{t=0} = [X, Y].$$\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"the Lie derivative of a vector field equals the Lie bracket\". But in the formula given, the left-hand side is the derivative of the pushforward of Y by phi_{-t} at t=0. The Lie derivative of Y with respect to X is typically defined as this derivative. So the problem is essentially to show that this Lie derivative equals the Lie bracket [X,Y], which is the commutator as defined.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is correctly captured by the given formula. So the assumptions are as above, each on a separate line, and the problem is to prove that equality.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, n was just an integer. Wait, in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't there. Wait, the original example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe there was a mistake there. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually restrict the problem. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake. But since the user provided that example, I should follow their structure, but in their example, they included an incorrect assumption. Wait, maybe the example was for a different problem. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to extract the correct assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the current problem. The problem states that X and Y are vector fields on M, phi_t is the flow of X, and the Lie bracket is defined as the commutator. These are all the given conditions. So each of these is an assumption. The problem is to prove the derivative equals the bracket.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have these four assumptions listed, each on a separate line, and the problem statement as given.",
