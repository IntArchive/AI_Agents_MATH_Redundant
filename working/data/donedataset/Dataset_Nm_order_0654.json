    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original problem. \n\nThe original problem states: $a, b, c \\geqslant 0$, $a + b + c = 3$, and $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\neq 0$. Then, we need to prove the inequality involving the three terms. \n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. Each variable $a$, $b$, and $c$ is non-negative. That's three separate conditions, but since they are all stated together, maybe list them as one assumption per variable? Wait, the instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"a is non-negative\", \"b is non-negative\", \"c is non-negative\". \n\n2. The sum $a + b + c = 3$. That's a single equation involving all three variables, so that's one assumption.\n\n3. The product $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\neq 0$. This means none of the terms $a+b$, $b+c$, or $c+a$ can be zero. Since each term being zero would imply, for example, $a = -b$, but since all variables are non-negative, $a + b = 0$ would imply $a = b = 0$. Therefore, this condition ensures that none of the pairs sum to zero. Therefore, each of $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+a$ is positive. So perhaps this is a single assumption about the product not being zero, but it affects all three pairs. However, according to the example given, each assumption should apply to one object. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So maybe here, since $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \\neq 0$ is a single condition, even though it affects multiple pairs, it's one assumption. Alternatively, maybe split into each pair? But the original problem states the product is not zero, so it's a single condition. So I think this counts as one assumption. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $a \\geq 0$\n\n- $b \\geq 0$\n\n- $c \\geq 0$\n\n- $a + b + c = 3$\n\n- $(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) \\neq 0$\n\nThen the problem is to prove the given inequality. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the user included only two assumptions even though the original problem had more. Wait, the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\" and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", so the assumption would be that n is an integer, and then the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. However, in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that example seems a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. However, the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that maybe the original problem had a mistake, or perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, then the assumption should only be that n is an integer. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which would make the problem statement only for n divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nAh, perhaps the original problem in the example had a different condition. Maybe the user intended to present an example where the original problem was actually for n divisible by 7, but wrote it as \"for every integer n\". Hmm, this is confusing. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are split into individual lines, each addressing one property or condition for one object.\n\nSo, returning to the current problem. The original problem states three variables a, b, c are non-negative, sum to 3, and that the product (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) is non-zero. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. a is non-negative.\n\n2. b is non-negative.\n\n3. c is non-negative.\n\n4. a + b + c = 3.\n\n5. (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≠ 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The fifth assumption ensures that none of the denominators in the inequality are zero. For example, in the term (a + 1)/(a + b), if a + b were zero, then since a and b are non-negative, that would require a = b = 0, but then c = 3. However, (a + b) in that case would be zero, but the condition (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≠ 0 prevents that. Similarly, all denominators a + b, b + c, c + a are positive.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these assumptions on separate lines and then present the problem statement.",
