    "Content": "There was previous task was same but with $N = 185$. And I prove it by showing that number of Sylow subgroups is 1 for every prime $p\\mid N$. But there I have some options $N_5 \\in \\{1, 51\\}$, $N_{17} = 1$, $N_3 \\in \\{1, 85\\}$. I've tried to get contradiction from $N_5 = 51$ or $N_3=85$, but I didn't manage to do it I understand that it's impossible to have $N_5 = 51$ and $N_3=85$ at the same time.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $G$ is a finite group of order $|G| = 255 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17$ . We will show that $G$ must be cyclic. As you noticed, there must be only one Sylow subgroup $P$ of order $17$ . Thus $P$ must be a normal subgroup. Since $17$ is prime the subgroup $P$ is cyclic, say $P = \\langle a \\rangle$ . It is not difficult to see that every group of order $15$ is cyclic, so $G/P = \\langle bP \\rangle$ is also cyclic. Now $(bP)^{|b|} = P$ , so $|bP| = 15 \\mid |b|$ . If $|b| = 255$ we are done. Therefore we can assume $|b| = 15$ . We will show that $ab = ba$ which implies that $ab$ has order $255$ since $15$ and $17$ are coprime. Because $P$ is normal, $bab^{-1} = a^i$ for some integer $i$ . Using this fact we get $b^2ab^{-2} = ba^ib^{-1} = (bab^{-1})^i = a^{i^2}$ and by induction $b^kab^{-k} = a^{i^k}$ for all $k \\geq 1$ . Thus $a = b^{15}ab^{-15} = a^{i^{15}}$ , which gives $i^{15} \\equiv 1 \\mod{17}$ . By Fermat's little theorem $i^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod{17}$ and since $15$ and $16$ are coprime, $i \\equiv 1 \\mod{17}$ . Therefore $bab^{-1} = a$ , proving the claim. This exercise is a special case of a more general fact. Using the idea of this solution and the fact that in a group of squarefree order the Sylow subgroup corresponding to the largest prime is normal, you can prove that every group of order $n$ is cyclic when $n$ and $\\varphi(n)$ are coprime ( $\\varphi$ is the totient function). This is done by Tibor Szele in the following short article (in German). T.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual mathematics professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first understand the original question and then break it down into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe title of the question is \"Every group of order 255 is commutative.\" The user mentions that they previously worked on a similar problem with N = 185 and proved it by showing that the number of Sylow subgroups is 1 for every prime divisor p of N. For the current problem with N = 255, they are trying to apply similar Sylow theory arguments but are stuck on potential contradictions with the number of Sylow subgroups.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and filter out any unrelated information. The main problem here is to prove that every group of order 255 is commutative (which is the same as being abelian). The user references Sylow subgroup counts, specifically mentioning N_5, N_17, and N_3, which correspond to the Sylow subgroups for primes 3, 5, and 17 dividing 255.\n\nLet me factorize 255 to confirm the primes: 255 = 3 × 5 × 17. So, the primes involved are 3, 5, and 17. The Sylow theorems tell us that the number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted N_p, must satisfy certain conditions: N_p ≡ 1 mod p and N_p divides the order of the group divided by p^k, where p^k is the highest power of p dividing the group order.\n\nFor each prime:\n- For p=3: The Sylow 3-subgroup number N_3 must divide 255/3 = 85, so possible N_3 are 1, 5, 17, 85. But the user says N_3 ∈ {1, 85}, which might be because they considered that 5 ≡ 2 mod 3 and 17 ≡ 2 mod 3, so 5 and 17 are not congruent to 1 mod 3, leaving N_3 as 1 or 85. Wait, 85 is 85 ≡ 85 mod 3. 85 divided by 3 is 28*3 + 1, so 85 ≡ 1 mod 3. So N_3 must be 1 or 85 because those are the divisors of 85 (which is 5×17) that are ≡1 mod 3. Wait, 85 ≡ 1 mod 3 because 85 = 3*28 + 1. So yes, N_3 can be 1 or 85.\n\nSimilarly for p=5: The number N_5 must divide 255/5 = 51, so possible divisors are 1, 3, 17, 51. But N_5 ≡ 1 mod 5. So 3 mod 5 is 3, 17 mod 5 is 2, 51 mod 5 is 1. Therefore, N_5 can be 1 or 51.\n\nFor p=17: The number N_17 must divide 255/17 = 15, so possible divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. N_17 ≡1 mod 17. All these divisors are less than 17, so the only one that satisfies N_17 ≡1 mod 17 is 1. Therefore, N_17 =1.\n\nSo the user is considering the possibilities where N_3=85 or N_5=51 and trying to find contradictions. They mention that having both N_5=51 and N_3=85 simultaneously might be impossible, but they couldn't derive the contradiction.\n\nThe problem is to show that every group of order 255 is abelian. The key assumptions here would relate to the Sylow subgroups' counts and properties. However, in the problem statement, we need to list each assumption line by line. But in the original problem, the user is not adding extra assumptions beyond the group having order 255. The task is to prove that all such groups are commutative. So perhaps the assumptions are the Sylow conditions inherent to the group of order 255.\n\nWait, in the example given, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the user is not stating any additional conditions beyond the group having order 255. However, the user's question mentions previous attempts with Sylow counts, so maybe the assumptions are the Sylow conditions that must hold for a group of order 255. But according to the format, the assumptions should be listed as given in the problem. However, the original problem here is \"Every group of order 255 is commutative,\" so the only assumption is that G is a group of order 255. But according to the example, the user broke down the problem's inherent assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7 (though in the original problem, it was for every integer n, so perhaps that was a mistake). Wait, maybe the example was a specific case where the problem had a hidden assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to structure a problem where the divisibility by 91 requires n to be divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. That might be an error in the example.\n\nBut following the instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. In the given example, the original problem had a general statement but the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7). That might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the example is a mistake. But regardless, the current problem is \"Every group of order 255 is commutative,\" so the main assumption is that G is a group of order 255. However, the user's discussion in the question talks about Sylow subgroups' possibilities. So perhaps the assumptions to list are the Sylow conditions that must hold for such a group, but those are part of the problem's inherent properties, not external assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's assumptions could be the basic properties of the group, such as its order, and the Sylow counts. But according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a group of order 255.\n- The Sylow 3-subgroup count N_3 is either 1 or 85.\n- The Sylow 5-subgroup count N_5 is either 1 or 51.\n- The Sylow 17-subgroup count N_17 is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't state these as assumptions; these are conclusions from Sylow theorems applied to groups of order 255. So maybe the assumptions are the basic properties of G, and the problem is to show it's commutative. However, according to the example, assumptions are listed as given conditions. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem had a typo. But perhaps in the current case, the problem is to prove that every group of order 255 is commutative, so the only assumption is that G is a group of order 255. However, the user's question mentions the Sylow counts, so perhaps the problem should include those Sylow conditions as assumptions. But according to the problem statement, those are derived from Sylow theorems, not given assumptions. So perhaps the correct way is to list the group's order as the assumption.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that's conflicting because the original says \"for every integer n,\" which includes all integers, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe there was a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to be \"for every integer n divisible by 7,\" but the user made an error. \n\nIn any case, following the user's instruction to structure the problem as in the example, for the current problem, the key assumption is that G is a group of order 255, and the problem is to prove it's commutative. However, the user's question discusses the Sylow counts, so perhaps the problem should include the possible Sylow counts as assumptions? But those are not assumptions; they are consequences of Sylow's theorems. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: G is a group of order 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two assumptions. This suggests that in the current problem, we should list all inherent assumptions necessary. However, since the problem is \"Every group of order 255 is commutative,\" the only assumption needed is that G is a group of order 255. But perhaps the Sylow conditions are part of the problem's setup, but they are derived, not assumptions. So maybe the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption: G is a group of order 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nBut the user's original question mentions Sylow subgroups counts, so maybe to make it more precise, the assumptions could include the possible Sylow counts. However, according to the problem's statement, those are not given; they are part of the proof. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to state the group's order as the sole assumption.\n\nWait, but in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might have been a mistake. But following that, perhaps the user wants to list the necessary conditions derived from the problem's statement. But in the current problem, the group's order is 255, and the task is to prove it's abelian. The user's discussion is about Sylow counts leading to contradictions if multiple Sylow numbers are non-trivial. But the problem itself doesn't state those Sylow counts as assumptions; they are part of the proof process.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: G is a group of order 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to include the Sylow counts as assumptions, but that's not accurate because they are not given; they are conclusions from Sylow's theorems. So the only assumption is that G is a group of order 255. However, looking back at the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems incorrect. So maybe the example is wrong, and the user actually wants to extract all inherent assumptions from the problem. In the example, perhaps the problem had a hidden assumption that n must be divisible by 7 to have 91 divide A(n), but the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" which would be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the example is flawed.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: G is a group.\nAssumption: The order of G is 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property applied to one object. So \"G is a group\" and \"G has order 255\" as separate assumptions. Alternatively, combine them as \"G is a group of order 255.\" But the example had two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So following that, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: G is a group.\nAssumption: The order of G is 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in Vietnamese, but the user hasn't provided that, so maybe just in English. But the user mentioned being bilingual, but the problem is presented in English. So the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line, each as a single property. So:\n\nAssumption: G is a group.\nAssumption: The order of G is 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the problem is to prove every group of order 255 is commutative, so the only assumptions are that G is a group of order 255. However, the user's question talks about Sylow subgroups' counts, but those are part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions. So the correct formatted problem would be as above. But let me check again the example to ensure consistency.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" However, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; it said \"for every integer n.\" This suggests that there might be a mistake in the example. If the problem requires divisibility by 91=13*7, then perhaps n needs to satisfy certain conditions. For example, if the expression A(n) is divisible by 7 and 13, then maybe n needs to be such that 5^n and 6^n have certain properties modulo 7 and 13. But without additional constraints, the original problem's statement might be incorrect. Therefore, the example's formatted problem might have added the assumption that n is divisible by 7 to make the divisibility by 91 possible, which wasn't in the original problem. That would be an error.\n\nIn the current problem, the correct assumptions should only be those given in the problem statement. The problem states \"Every group of order 255 is commutative.\" Therefore, the assumptions are that G is a group and its order is 255. The problem is to prove it's commutative. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: G is a group.\nAssumption: The order of G is 255.\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n\nAlternatively, combining into one line: \"G is a group of order 255.\" But following the example's style, which listed two separate assumptions for the same object (n), perhaps here we should list two assumptions: one that G is a group, and another that its order is 255.\n\nBut maybe in the context of group theory problems, it's standard to take \"G is a group of order 255\" as a single assumption. However, the example splits \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" into two separate assumptions. So following that, we can split \"G is a group\" and \"order of G is 255\" into two lines.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: G is a group\nAssumption: The order of G is 255\nProblem: Prove that G is commutative.\n###",
