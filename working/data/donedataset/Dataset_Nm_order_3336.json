    "Content": "Let $g\\in C_0^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ (infinitely differentiable with compact support), and let $$\\hat{g}(y)=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x)e^{-ixy}dx$$ Assume that $\\hat{g}$ is in the Schwartz class. Prove that $$g(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\hat{g}(y)e^{ixy}dy$$ We may use the result that if $f\\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$ is a periodic function of period $2L$ , then $$\\hat{f}(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2L}\\int_{-L}^Lf(y)e^{-in\\pi y/L}dy\\right)e^{i\\pi nx/L}$$ I'm trying to follow Steven Stadnicki 's hint. Since $g$ has compact support, let $N$ be such that $g(x)=0$ for all $|x|>N$ . Choose $L>N$ , and let $f_L(x)=g(x)$ for $|x|\\leq N$ and extend $f_L(x)$ periodically with period $2L$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ . Then we have $$\\hat{f_L}(x)=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2L}\\int_{-L}^Lf(y)e^{-in\\pi y/L}dy\\right)e^{i\\pi nx/L}$$ If I send $L$ to $\\infty$ , in some sense I get the function $g$ . But I'm still confused how the Fourier coefficients of $f_L$ will translate to the coefficients of $g$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about deriving the Fourier inversion formula from Fourier series, specifically for a function g that's smooth with compact support and whose Fourier transform is in the Schwartz class. They also mention using a result about periodic functions. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original question carefully.\n\nThe problem states that g is in C_0^∞(ℝ), which means it's infinitely differentiable with compact support. Then, the Fourier transform of g, denoted ĝ(y), is given by the integral from -∞ to ∞ of g(x)e^{-ixy} dx. It's also mentioned that ĝ is in the Schwartz class. The goal is to prove the inversion formula, which is g(x) = 1/(2π) times the integral of ĝ(y)e^{ixy} dy from -∞ to ∞.\n\nThe user also references a result for periodic functions f of period 2L, where the Fourier series is expressed as a sum involving integrals over [-L, L]. They extend g periodically to f_L with period 2L, where L is chosen larger than the support of g. Then, as L approaches infinity, they expect to recover g from the Fourier series.\n\nNow, to list the assumptions:\n\n1. g is in C_0^∞(ℝ) (infinitely differentiable with compact support). This is a single property of g.\n2. The Fourier transform ĝ(y) is defined as the integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ g(x)e^{-ixy} dx. This is another property, defining ĝ.\n3. ĝ belongs to the Schwartz class. Separate assumption about ĝ.\n4. The result provided about periodic functions f in C^∞(ℝ) with period 2L. This is a given condition that can be used.\n5. The approach involves choosing L > N where N is such that g(x) = 0 for |x| > N. This is part of the method outlined in the question, so it's an assumption about how L is chosen relative to the support of g.\n6. Extending g periodically to f_L with period 2L. This is another step in the method, so an assumption about constructing f_L.\n\nEach of these points addresses a single property or condition applied to one object. Now, the problem statement is to prove the inversion formula given these conditions and using the provided result.\n\nI need to make sure that all assumptions are covered, and the problem is clearly stated. Let me check the original question again. The user mentions that f_L is extended periodically from g, and as L approaches infinity, they want to see how the Fourier coefficients translate to those of g. But in the problem statement, the main task is to prove the inversion formula using these steps.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include the properties of g, its Fourier transform, the given result about periodic functions, and the construction of f_L. Then the problem is to prove the inversion formula.\n\nPutting it all together, each assumption should be a separate line. Let me structure them accordingly.",
