    "Content": "I am looking for an easy proof that the adjoint of a compact operator on a Hilbert space is again compact. This makes the big characterization theorem for compact operators (i.e. compact iff image of unit ball is relatively compact iff image of unit ball is compact iff norm limit of finite rank operators) much easier to prove, provided that you have already developed spectral theory for C*-algebras. By the way, I'm using the definition that an operator $T\\colon H \\to H$ is compact if and only if given any [bounded] sequence of vectors $(x_n)$, the image sequence $(Tx_n)$ has a convergent subsequence. edited for bounded",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "What you're asking about is called Schauder's theorem . An operator $T: X \\to Y$ is compact if and only if $T^{\\ast}: Y^{\\ast} \\to X^{\\ast}$ is compact. I'm using the following definition of compactness: An operator $T: X \\to Y$ between Banach spaces is compact if and only if every sequence $(x_{n}) \\subset B_{X}$ in the unit ball of $X$ has a subsequence $(x_{n_{j}})$ such that $(Tx_{n_j})$ converges. This implies that $K = \\overline{T(B_{X})} \\subset Y$ is compact, as it is sequentially compact and metric. Now let $(\\phi_{n}) \\subset B_{Y^{\\ast}}$ be any sequence and we want to show that $(T^{\\ast}\\phi_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence. Observe that the sequence $f_{n} = \\phi_{n}|_{K}$  in $C(K)$ is bounded and equicontinuous, so by the theorem of Arzelà-Ascoli , the sequence $(f_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence $(f_{n_{j}})$ in $C(K)$. Now observe \n$$\\|T^{\\ast}\\phi_{n_i} - T^{\\ast}\\phi_{n_{j}}\\| = \\sup_{x \\in B_{X}} \\|\\phi_{n_i}(Tx) - \\phi_{n_j}(Tx)\\| = \\sup_{k \\in K} |f_{n_i}(k) - f_{n_j}(k)|$$ where the last equality follows from the fact that $T(B_{X})$ is dense in $K$. But this means that $(T^{\\ast}\\phi_{n_j})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X^{\\ast}$, hence it converges. I leave the other implication as well as the translation to the Hilbert adjoint to you as an exercise.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Easy Proof Adjoint(Compact)=Compact\". The user wants an easy proof that the adjoint of a compact operator on a Hilbert space is again compact. They mention that this result would simplify the characterization theorem for compact operators, especially after developing spectral theory for C*-algebras. The definition provided for a compact operator T: H → H is that given any bounded sequence (x_n), the image sequence (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence. The user also notes that the sequence was edited to specify that it's bounded.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is the main statement that needs to be proven.\n\nLet's break down the assumptions. The problem is about operators on a Hilbert space. The key objects here are the operator T and its adjoint T*. The main conditions are that T is compact, and the space is a Hilbert space. The definition given for compactness involves taking bounded sequences and having convergent subsequences in their images. The user also mentions the context of spectral theory for C*-algebras, but that seems more like motivation rather than an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space.\n2. T: H → H is a compact operator (as per the given definition).\n3. The adjoint operator T* exists (since we're in a Hilbert space, every bounded operator has an adjoint, but compact operators are bounded, so T* exists).\n\nWait, but do we need to state that T is bounded? Since compact operators on normed spaces are necessarily bounded, but maybe in some contexts, people might consider unbounded operators. However, the standard definition of compact operators includes boundedness. The user's definition mentions that the sequence (x_n) is bounded, so T is acting on bounded sequences. But in Hilbert spaces, operators are typically assumed to be linear and bounded unless stated otherwise. But since the user gives a specific definition here, perhaps we should include the definition's conditions as assumptions?\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that the adjoint of a compact operator is compact. So the assumptions are that T is compact (as per the given definition), H is a Hilbert space, and we need to show T* is compact. The definition provided by the user is part of the problem's framework, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem's context. However, the problem is structured to include the necessary conditions in the assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the example given, in the original problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the problem statement in the example didn't explicitly state that. Wait, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be an error. Wait no, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example has a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem in the example was actually requiring n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\". Hmm, that seems like a mistake in the example. Maybe the original problem had a different condition, but the user's example might have an error. Anyway, that's their example. But for our current problem, we need to focus on the actual question given.\n\nSo, for the current problem, the user wants to prove that the adjoint of a compact operator is compact. The key assumptions here are:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- T is a compact operator on H (as per the given definition: for any bounded sequence (x_n), (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence).\n- The adjoint operator T* is considered.\n\nBut wait, the existence of the adjoint is guaranteed in Hilbert spaces for bounded operators. Since T is compact, hence bounded, so T* exists. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space.\n2. T: H → H is a compact operator (i.e., for every bounded sequence (x_n) in H, the sequence (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence).\n3. T* is the adjoint operator of T.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that T* is compact. So the problem statement is \"Prove that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions don't need to include T* being the adjoint, since that's part of the problem's conclusion. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- T: H → H is a compact operator (using the given definition).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nBut do I need to include the definition of compactness in the assumptions? The user provided the definition, but in the example, the assumptions were specific conditions on n, not the definition of divisibility. So perhaps the definition is part of the problem's context and not listed as an assumption. The key assumptions here are the structure (Hilbert space), the operator being compact, and perhaps the existence of the adjoint.\n\nWait, but the existence of the adjoint is guaranteed in Hilbert spaces for bounded operators, and compact operators are bounded. So since T is compact, T is bounded, hence T* exists. So maybe the assumptions are just:\n\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- T is a compact operator on H.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that T* is compact.\n\nBut perhaps the user's definition of compactness is important here. The problem uses the sequential definition: T is compact if for every bounded sequence (x_n), (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence. So maybe we need to include that definition in the assumptions?\n\nIn the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems conflicting, but perhaps the example had a different original problem. Anyway, in our current case, the problem's assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space.\n2. T: H → H is a compact operator (i.e., T maps bounded sequences to sequences with convergent subsequences).\n\nProblem: Prove that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nWait, but the problem is about adjoints of compact operators being compact. So the main assumptions are the Hilbert space setting and T being compact. The problem is to show T* is compact.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nT is a compact operator on H (using the given sequential definition).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nBut the user's example had multiple assumptions each on their own line. So each assumption line addresses only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nT: H → H is a compact operator,\nCompactness of T is defined as: for every bounded sequence (x_n) in H, the sequence (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence.\n\nBut wait, the definition of compactness is part of the problem's framework. The user provided the definition they're using, so maybe that should be included as an assumption. However, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n, not the definition of divisibility. So perhaps the definition is part of the problem's context and not listed as an assumption. But in this case, the user is specifying the definition of compactness they are using. So maybe the assumption should include that T is compact as per that definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition is part of the problem statement. For example, the problem is to prove T* is compact under the given definition. But the user wants the assumptions to list the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the definition is part of the problem's setup, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the given conditions that are taken as premises. Since the user provides the definition, perhaps the only assumptions are H being a Hilbert space and T being compact (with compactness as defined). However, since the definition is specific, maybe it's better to include it as part of the assumptions.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are conditions on n. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under those assumptions. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so maybe there was a mistake in the example. Regardless, we need to follow the user's instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- H is a Hilbert space.\n- T: H → H is an operator.\n- T is compact (i.e., for every bounded sequence (x_n) in H, the sequence (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nBut maybe \"operator\" is redundant since T is already mentioned. Alternatively, since in Hilbert spaces, adjoints exist for bounded operators, and compact operators are bounded, perhaps we need to include that T is bounded? Wait, but compactness implies boundedness in normed spaces. So if T is compact, then T is automatically bounded. So maybe we don't need to state that separately.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps the user's definition of compact operator includes boundedness, but in some contexts, people might define compact operators without assuming boundedness. However, the standard definition includes boundedness. Since the user specifies that the image of a bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence, and since T is linear, then T must be bounded. Because if T were unbounded, there would exist a bounded sequence (x_n) such that ||T x_n|| → ∞, which cannot have a convergent subsequence. Therefore, T being compact in this definition implies T is bounded. Hence, T is a bounded operator, and its adjoint exists.\n\nTherefore, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space.\n2. T: H → H is a compact operator (as per the given definition).\n\nProblem: Prove that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nBut to adhere to the user's example structure, each assumption should be a single line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nT is an operator on H,\nT is compact (i.e., for every bounded sequence (x_n) in H, (T x_n) has a convergent subsequence).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nAlternatively, the definition of compactness is part of the problem's context, so the assumption is just that T is compact, and the problem is to show T* is compact under that definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's definition is part of the problem statement. But the user wants the problem to be structured with assumptions and problem. The problem is to prove T* is compact, given that T is compact (under the specific definition provided).\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should have assumptions that H is a Hilbert space and T is a compact operator, with compactness defined as per the user's description. Since each assumption should be one line, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nH is a Hilbert space,\nT: H → H is a compact operator (as defined by the user),\nThe adjoint operator T* exists.\n\nBut wait, the existence of T* is guaranteed because T is bounded (since compact operators are bounded), and in Hilbert spaces, every bounded operator has an adjoint. Therefore, maybe we don't need to state that T* exists as an assumption; it's a consequence of T being compact.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. H is a Hilbert space.\n2. T is a compact operator on H (using the provided definition).\n\nProblem: Prove that the adjoint operator T* is compact.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because the problem is to show that if T is compact (under the given definition), then T* is also compact. The Hilbert space context is necessary because adjoints in Banach spaces are different, and the proof might rely on Hilbert space properties like the existence of orthonormal bases or the Riesz representation theorem.\n\nTherefore, the final structured problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nH is a Hilbert space,\n$T\\colon H \\to H$ is a compact operator (i.e., for any bounded sequence $(x_n)$ in $H$, $(T x_n)$ has a convergent subsequence).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the adjoint operator $T^*$ is compact.",
