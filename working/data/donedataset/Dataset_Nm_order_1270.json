    "Content": "There are probably many ways of talking about a second (integral) cohomology class of a smooth, closed, orientable manifold $M$ of dimension $n$.  Here are a few, with $\\alpha\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb{Z})$: Using Poincare duality, obtain a homology class $\\hat{\\alpha}\\in H_{n-2}(M,\\mathbb{Z})$. This can be represented by a submanifold $A$. $\\alpha$ is represented by (the homotopy class of) a map $f:\\ M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^\\infty$, which can be homotoped to have target $\\mathbb{CP}^N$, where $2N\\ge n$. Taking the preimage of a (transverse) $\\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ gives a submanifold $B$. $\\alpha$ is the first Chern class of a complex line bundle $\\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow E\\rightarrow M$. If $s:\\ M\\rightarrow E$ is a generic section, then the zero set of $s$ is a submanifold $C$. What's kind of amazing is that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all homotopic (the same)! I have used this many times, but don't think I've ever seen a detailed proof of all this before.  I understand the basic setup (the construcion of $f$ in 2., the line bundle setup in 3., ...), but I don't know why these three ideas give essentially the same result: that is, why $B$ and $C$ are indeed Poincare dual to $\\alpha$. I would really enjoy some references, outlines of proofs, etc.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "OK, I have tracked down some references, etc., for all of this. To show that 2. works, I refer to theorem VI.11.16 in Bredon's Topology and Geometry , where a complete proof is given. To show that 3. works, I refer to theorem 5.2 of these notes ; all of the necessary material is contained in Bredon's book, but I couldn't find so explicit a statement as that in the notes.  Plus, the notes are nice anyway. The only thing to do is show how 2. and 3. are connected. Now if $\\alpha\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb{Z})$, then it is represented by some (smooth) map $f:\\ M\\rightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^N$ for high enough $N$; this is the map mentioned in 2.  The representation is by the pullback of the fundamental class $u\\in H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^N,\\mathbb{Z})$: $\\alpha=f^\\ast(u)$. Now $u$ itself is the first Chern class of the canonical line bundle (call it $E$) over $\\mathbb{CP}^N$: $u=c_1(E)$. By naturality, we have $\\alpha=f^\\ast(c_1(E))=c_1(f^\\ast(E))$. $f^\\ast(E)$ is the complex line bundle mentioned in 3.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants the assumptions and the problem structured in a specific format. First, I need to read through the Math Stack Exchange question carefully and filter out the unrelated information.\n\nThe question is about different ways of representing a second cohomology class on a manifold and proving that the submanifolds obtained from these methods are homotopic (or the same). The user mentions three approaches: using Poincaré duality to get a submanifold A, mapping to CP^N to get B via a preimage, and using the zero set of a section of a line bundle to get C. The problem is to show why B and C are Poincaré dual to α, hence proving they are homotopic to A.\n\nNow, listing the assumptions. The assumptions should be one property per line, applied to one object. Let's parse the original question again.\n\nAssumptions needed:\n\n1. M is a smooth, closed, orientable manifold.\n2. M has dimension n.\n3. α is an element of H²(M, ℤ) (second integral cohomology class).\n4. Poincaré duality is applied to α to obtain a homology class in H_{n-2}(M, ℤ) represented by submanifold A.\n5. The map f: M → CP^∞ representing α can be homotoped to have target CP^N with 2N ≥ n.\n6. The preimage of a transverse CP^{N-1} under this map gives submanifold B.\n7. α is the first Chern class of a complex line bundle E over M.\n8. A generic section s: M → E has a zero set which is a submanifold C.\n9. The problem states that A, B, C are homotopic (the same).\n\nThe problem is to prove that B and C are Poincaré dual to α, hence showing they are homotopic to A.\n\nWait, the user mentions they want to know why B and C are Poincaré dual to α, leading to them being homotopic. The original problem's core is the equivalence of these representations. So the problem statement should be to show that B and C, obtained via those methods, are Poincaré dual to α, hence homotopic to A.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a smooth, closed, orientable manifold,\nM has dimension n,\nα is an element of the second integral cohomology group H²(M, ℤ),\nUsing Poincaré duality, α corresponds to a homology class in H_{n-2}(M, ℤ),\nThe homology class from Poincaré duality is represented by a submanifold A,\nThe cohomology class α can be represented by a map f: M → CP^∞,\nThe map f can be homotoped to a map with target CP^N where 2N ≥ n,\nThe preimage of a transverse CP^{N-1} under f gives a submanifold B,\nα is the first Chern class of a complex line bundle E over M,\nA generic section s of E has a zero set that is a submanifold C.\n\nProblem:\nProve that submanifolds B and C are Poincaré dual to α, hence homotopic to A.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem says that A, B, C are the same (homotopic), and the task is to show why B and C are Poincaré dual to α, which would imply they are equivalent to A. So the problem is to show that B and C are Poincaré dual to α, thus establishing their equivalence to A.\n\nBut the original problem mentions that the user wants a proof that these three constructions give the same result. So the problem could be phrased as proving that B and C are Poincaré dual to α (thereby showing they are homotopic to A).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more precisely, the problem is to prove that the submanifolds B and C obtained via the respective methods are Poincaré dual to α, hence are homotopic to A.\n\nBut the user's exact question is: \"why these three ideas give essentially the same result: that is, why B and C are indeed Poincare dual to α.\" So the problem is to show that B and C are Poincaré dual to α, hence equivalent to A.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as each condition leading to the construction of A, B, C, and the problem is to prove the duality for B and C leading to their equivalence to A.",
