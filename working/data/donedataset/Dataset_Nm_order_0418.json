    "AcceptedAnswer": "Many of the divisibility properties of Fibonacci numbers follow from the fact that they comprise a divisibility sequence, i.e. $\\rm\\,m\\,|\\,n\\ \\Rightarrow\\ F_m\\,|\\,F_n.\\,$ All of your statements above are special cases of this, e.g. $\\rm\\,F_{15} = 610,\\,$ so $\\rm\\,15\\,|\\,n\\ \\Rightarrow\\ F_{15}\\,|\\,F_n,\\,$ i.e. $\\rm\\,610\\,|\\,F_n,\\,$ which is equivalent to your statement $(11),\\,$ that $10$ and $61$ divide every $15\\,$ 'th Fibonacci number. In fact $\\rm\\,F_n\\,$ is strong divisibility sequence, i.e. $\\rm\\,(F_m,F_n) = F_{(m,n)},\\,$ i.e. $\\rm\\,gcd(F_m,F_n) = F_{\\gcd(m,n)}.\\,$ This stronger property specializes to the above property if $\\rm\\,m\\mid n\\,\\ (\\!\\!\\iff \\gcd(m,n) = m\\,\\!).\\,$ The proof is not  difficult. Here is a straightforward way to proceed. Recall the Fibonacci addition law $\\rm\\,F_{n+m} =F_{n+1}\\,F_m + F_n\\,F_{m-1}.\\,$ Applying the shift $\\rm\\,n\\to n-m\\ $ this addition law becomes $\\rm\\,\\color{#c00}{F_n}  = F_{n-m+1}\\,F_m  + F_{n-m}\\,F_{m-1}\\!\\color{#c00}{\\equiv F_{n-m}\\,F_{m-1}}\\pmod{\\!F_m}.\\,$ So for $\\rm\\,k=m-1\\,$ we may invoke the Theorem below to conclude that $\\rm\\,f_n  = F_n\\,$ is a strong divisibility sequence. Theorem $ $ Let $\\rm\\ f_n\\, $ be an integer sequence such that $\\rm\\ f_{\\:\\!0} =\\, 0,\\ f_1 = 1\\ $ and such that for all $\\rm\\,n > m\\,$ holds $\\rm\\ \\, \\color{#c00}{f_n\\equiv\\, f_{\\,k}\\ f_{n-m}}\\,\\ (mod\\ f_m)\\ $ for some $\\rm\\,k < n,\\ (k,m)\\, =\\, 1.\\, $ Then $\\rm\\ (f_n,f_m) = f_{\\,(n,\\,m)} $ Proof $\\ $ We induct on size $\\rm:=n + m.\\,$ It's trivially true if $\\rm\\ n = m\\ $ or $\\rm\\ n = 0\\ $ or $\\rm\\, m = 0,\\,$ so we may assume wlog $\\rm\\,n > m > 0.\\,$ Since $\\rm\\,k\\!+\\!m < n\\!+\\!m,\\,$ by induction $\\rm\\,(f_{\\,k},f_m)=f_{\\,(k,\\,m)}\\!=\\,f_1 = 1.\\,$ So $\\rm\\ (\\color{#c00}{f_n},\\,f_m)\\overset{\\color{#90f}R}=\\ (\\color{#c00}{f_{\\,k}\\,f_{n-m}},\\,f_m)\\, \\!\\overset{\\color{#0a0}E}= (f_{n-m},\\,f_m)\\, =\\, f_{\\,(n-m,\\,m)} =\\, f_{\\,(n,\\,m)} $ follows by induction  (which applies here since $\\rm\\,(n-m)+m\\,  <\\, n+m\\,\\!),\\,$ and by employing  well-known gcd laws, namely $\\rm\\,\\color{#90f}R\\!:\\ (\\color{#c00}a,b) = (\\color{#c00}a',\\,b)\\ \\ if\\ \\ \\color{#c00}{a\\equiv a'}\\pmod{b}\\ $ and $\\rm\\,\\color{#0a0}E\\!:\\ (\\color{c00}c\\:\\!a,b) = (a,b)\\ $ if $\\rm\\ (c,b) = 1.\\ \\ $ QED Remark $ $ You may find it insightful to simultaneously examine other strong divisibility sequences, e.g. see this post on $\\rm\\,f_n = (x^n-1)/(x-1).\\,$ In this case $\\rm\\, \\gcd(f_m,f_n) = f_{\\,\\gcd(m,n)}\\,$ may be interpreted as a $\\rm\\,q$ -analog of the integer Bezout identity, for example $$\\quad\\begin{align} \\rm\\displaystyle\\ \\color{#c00}3 = (\\color{#0a0}{15},\\color{#90f}{21})\\,\\  \\leadsto\\,\\ f_{\\large \\color{#c00}3} &\\rm = f_{\\large (\\color{#0a0}{15},\\color{#90f}{21})}\\!=(f_{\\large \\color{#0a0}{15}},f_{\\large\\color{#90f}{21}}) = a\\, f_{\\:\\!\\large\\color{#0a0}{15}}\\,+\\ b\\, f_{\\:\\!\\large\\color{#90f}{21}},\\\\[.4em] \n\\rm i.e.\\quad\\ \\frac{x^{\\large \\color{#c00}3}-1}{x-1}&=\\rm\\ (x^{15} + x^9 + 1)\\ \\frac{x^{\\large\\color{#0a0}{15}}-1}{x-1} - (x^9\\!+x^3)\\, \\frac{x^{\\large\\color{#90f}{21}}-1}{x-1} \\end{align}$$ See also an answer on $\\rm\\, f_{\\:\\!n} = \\small\\dfrac{x^n-y^n}{x-y}\\,$ (homogenization), where the above also applies.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants a generalization of various Fibonacci divisibility properties mentioned. The examples given include things like every third Fibonacci number is even, 3 divides every 4th, 5 divides every 5th, and so on. The user also mentions two known properties: F_n divides F_{kn} and gcd(F_n, F_m) = F_{gcd(n,m)}. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the user is asking for. They want a single proof that generalizes all these specific cases. The examples provided seem to indicate that for certain divisors d, d divides every k-th Fibonacci number. For instance, 3 divides every 4th, 5 divides every 5th, etc. So the pattern here might relate to the divisibility of F_k by d, and how this repeats every k terms or something similar.\n\nLooking at the known properties: F_n divides F_{kn} means that if you take multiples of n, those Fibonacci numbers will be divisible by F_n. For example, F_3=2, so every 3rd Fibonacci number (F_3, F_6, F_9,...) is divisible by 2, which matches the first example (every third is even). Similarly, F_4=3, so every 4th Fibonacci number (F_4, F_8, F_12,...) would be divisible by 3, which matches the second example. This seems to fit. Then, the other property about gcd(F_n, F_m) being F_{gcd(n,m)} might explain other cases where the divisor is a combination of indices.\n\nSo the generalization could be that for any integer k, F_k divides F_{kn} for all n. That covers the cases where the divisor is F_k, and the divisibility occurs every k-th term. For example, F_5=5, so every 5th Fibonacci number is divisible by 5. Similarly, F_7=13, so every 7th is divisible by 13. That matches the examples given. \n\nBut wait, some examples have divisors that are not Fibonacci numbers. For instance, 6 divides every 12th Fibonacci number. But F_12 is 144, which is divisible by 6. However, the user mentions that 6,9,12,16 divide every 12th Fibonacci number. Hmm. Let's check F_12=144. 144 is divisible by 6,9,12,16? Wait 144 divided by 16 is 9, so yes. So maybe when multiple factors are involved, they can divide F_k for some k. For example, 6 is 2*3. F_3=2 and F_4=3. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, gcd(3,4)=1, so gcd(F_3, F_4)=F_1=1. But maybe the product of F_3 and F_4 divides F_{lcm(3,4)}=F_{12}. Since lcm(3,4)=12, and F_12=144. Indeed, 2*3=6 divides 144, which is why 6 divides every 12th Fibonacci number. Similarly, 9 is 3^2. F_4=3, and perhaps 3^2 divides F_{4*3}=F_{12}? Let me check F_12=144, which is 144/9=16, so yes. So maybe when the divisor is a product of Fibonacci numbers with coprime indices, or powers thereof, then the divisor divides F_{k} for some k, and hence divides every k-th term.\n\nSo perhaps the general statement is that if d is a divisor of F_k, then d divides every k-th Fibonacci number. But how does that cover the cases where the divisor is not a single Fibonacci number? For example, 6 divides F_12=144, and indeed every 12th Fibonacci number. But 6 is not a Fibonacci number. However, 6 is the product of F_3=2 and F_4=3, and since 3 and 4 are coprime, maybe the product divides F_{lcm(3,4)}=F_{12}. So more generally, if d is a product of F_{a_i} where the a_i are pairwise coprime, then d divides F_{lcm(a_i)}. This would explain why 6 (product of F_3 and F_4) divides F_{12} (lcm of 3 and 4 is 12). Similarly, 9=3^2, and maybe since F_4=3, 3^2 divides F_{4*3}=F_{12}? Wait, does F_12=144 divisible by 9? Yes, 144/9=16. So maybe if F_k is divisible by a prime power, then higher multiples can be formed. \n\nAlternatively, using the property that F_{kn} is divisible by F_k, so if d divides F_k, then d divides F_{kn} for all n. Therefore, to have d divides every k-th Fibonacci number, it's sufficient that d divides F_k. For example, d=5 divides F_5=5, hence every 5th Fibonacci number (F_5, F_10, F_15,...) is divisible by 5. Similarly, d=17 divides F_9=34, so 17 divides every 9th Fibonacci number. Wait, F_9=34, which is divisible by 17 (34/17=2). Then F_18=2584, which is 2584/17=152, so yes. That works. \n\nBut for the case of 6 dividing every 12th Fibonacci number, F_12=144, which is divisible by 6. So if d=6 divides F_12, then every 12th Fibonacci number is divisible by 6. Similarly, 9 divides F_12=144 (144/9=16), so every 12th Fibonacci number is divisible by 9. So perhaps the general rule is that for any integer d, if d divides F_k, then d divides every k-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that if d divides F_k, then d divides F_{kn} for all n. Which is already covered by the first property F_k divides F_{kn}, hence F_{kn} is divisible by F_k, and thus by any divisor of F_k. \n\nTherefore, the user's examples can be explained by noting that each divisor d in their examples divides F_k for some k, and hence every k-th Fibonacci number is divisible by d. For example, 13 divides F_7=13, so every 7th Fibonacci number is divisible by 13. Similarly, 7 divides F_8=21 (21/7=3), so every 8th Fibonacci number is divisible by 7. \n\nTherefore, the generalization would be that for any positive integers d and k, if d divides F_k, then d divides every k-th Fibonacci number, i.e., d divides F_{kn} for all n ≥ 1. The proof would rely on the property that F_k divides F_{kn}, so if d divides F_k, then d divides F_{kn} as well. \n\nAdditionally, the gcd property gcd(F_n, F_m) = F_{gcd(n,m)} can explain cases where multiple divisors are involved. For example, if we want divisors that are common to multiple Fibonacci numbers, but perhaps that's more about the gcd rather than divisibility in a sequence. \n\nSo putting this together, the problem is to show that if d divides F_k, then d divides F_{kn} for all n, which generalizes all the given examples. The user's examples are specific instances where d is a divisor of F_k, hence every k-th term is divisible by d. Thus, the structured problem should capture this generalization.",
