    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is too long for a comment, too.\nExperimentally, another type of approach leads to better approximations.\nAssume that we want a polynomial approximation of degree $n$ of a $\\mathcal{C}^1([0,1])$-function $f(x)$ with an $O(n^{-1})$ error term. Consider the function $g(x)$ whose graph is the convex envelope of the points $(0,f(0)),(1/n,f(1/n),\\ldots,(1,f(1))$. Clearly:\n$$\\| f(x)-g(x)\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\frac{M}{n},$$\nwhere $M$ is the Lipshitz constant of $f(x)$, i.e. $\\max_{x\\in[0,1]}|f'(x)|$. If $f(x)$ is a non-decreasing function, the stronger\n$$\\| f(x)-g(x)\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\frac{M}{2n}$$\nholds. Let now $h_p(x)$ be a \"step-identity\" continuous function of the form\n$$ h_p(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{rl}0 &\\mbox{if }x\\leq p,\\\\(x-p) &\\mbox{if }x\\geq p.\\end{array}\\right.$$\nIf $t>0$, $k_{p,t}(x)=h_{p}(x)-h_{p+t}(x)$ is a continuous \"step-identity-step\" function whose derivative is zero for $x<p$ or $x>p+t$ and one for $x\\in(p,p+t)$. Moreover, $g(x)$ can be written as a linear combination of $k_{p,t}$-functions, i.e.:\n$$ g(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{f\\left(\\frac{j+1}{n}\\right)-f\\left(\\frac{j}{n}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{n}}\\,k_{\\frac{j}{n},\\frac{1}{n}}(x), $$\nso the problem can be substantially reformulated as: find polynomial approximations of $k_{0,\\frac{1}{n}}(x)$ that are non-decreasing and have an $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\infty}$-error term bounded by constant times the reciprocal of the degree. Up to integration, this is the same as finding a positive and \"good\" polynomial approximation of the characteristic function of the $[0,1/n]$ interval. Bernstein polynomials almost do this, since they are positive, but with the wrong error term. Another reformulation is to find a tight polynomial upper bound for the absolute value function over the $[-1,1]$-interval. A classical try is to consider $q_n(y)$ as the truncated Taylor series of $\\sqrt{1-y}$ w.r.t. $y=0$ and take $p_n(x)=q_n(1-x^2)$. This gives $q_n(x)\\geq|x|$ as wanted, but the error term is $q_n(0)=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$, too big. Another try is to consider the Fourier-Chebyshev approximation of $|x|$, i.e.\n$$ p_{2n}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{(-1)^k T_{2k}(x)}{4k^2-1}. $$\n$p_{2n}(x)=|x|$ holds in $2n+2$ points, so $p_{2n}(x)$ in not an upper bound neither a lower bound for $|x|$, but $|p_{2n}(x)-|x||$ is a fast decreasing function:\n$$|p_{2n}(x)-|x||\\leq \\min\\left(\\frac{2}{(2n+1)\\pi},\\frac{1}{2\\pi n^2 |x|}\\right) $$\nand the error term is the right one: $\\|p_{2n}(x)-|x|\\|_{\\infty}=p_{2n}(0)=\\frac{2}{(2n+1)\\pi}=O\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$. If we approximate $k_{0,\\frac{1}{n}}$ with $p_{2n}(x)-p_{2n}(x-1/n)$, then $g(x)$ with these approximated $k$s, we end with a polynomial approximation $r_{2n}(x)$ of $f(x)$ \nthat satisfies:\n$$ \\|f(x)-r_{2n}(x)\\|_{\\infty}\\leq \\frac{M}{n}+Mn\\int_{-1}^{1}\\min\\left(\\frac{2}{(2n+1)\\pi},\\frac{1}{2\\pi n^2 |x|}\\right)dx=O\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{n}\\right),$$\nthat is far better than the Bernstein approximation, but it is still not what we want. Can we exploit the oscillations of the Chebyshev approximations in order to remove the logarithmic factor in the RHS? * UPDATE: * I believe not, since we have substantially built a trigonometric polynomial approximation through the convolution with respect to the Dirichlet kernel, whose $L^1$-norm is not bounded, but $\\Theta(\\log n)$ (this fact gives birth to the Gibbs phenomenon, for istance); then a reformulation is to find a \"good\" trigonometric kernel, for which \"good\" means non-negative (in order to preserve monotonicity) and almost orthogonal to continuous, piecewise-linear functions. \nIn the literature I found that the Jackson kernel, that is the square of the Fejer kernel, satisfies all the prescribed properties, but I am still not satisfied, since the Fourier coefficients of the Jackson kernel are pretty complicated. In order to get a monotonic polynomial approximation of a non-decreasing $\\mathcal{C}^1([0,1])$-function $f(x)$, we can choose a positive $K$ such that $\\sqrt{f'(x)+K}$ is regular enough to ensure the existence of a $O(n^{-1})$-polynomial approximation, then replicate fedja's argument, but the first step still seems out-of-reach, actually.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem according to the given example. Let me read through the original question again.\n\nThe title is \"Monotonic version of Weierstrass approximation theorem\". The user is asking to prove or disprove the existence of a sequence of real polynomials with three properties: each p_n is non-decreasing on [0,1], the degree of p_n is n, and the uniform norm of f - p_n is O(1/n). The function f is in C^1([0,1]) and is increasing over [0,1].\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's break down the problem.\n\n1. The function f is in C^1([0,1]). So that's one assumption: f is an element of C^1([0,1]).\n2. f is increasing over [0,1]. So another assumption: f is an increasing function on [0,1].\n3. The sequence of polynomials {p_n} must be non-decreasing on [0,1]. So each p_n is non-decreasing over [0,1].\n4. The degree of each p_n is n. So degree of p_n is n.\n5. The approximation error ||f - p_n||_infty is O(1/n). That's the last condition.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Prove or disprove the existence...\" So the problem is asking whether such a sequence exists under these conditions. The assumptions are the given conditions on f and the required properties of the polynomials.\n\nSo the Assumption section should list all the given conditions and required properties. Let me check the example again. In the example, they listed assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this problem, the assumptions are the hypotheses and the required properties of the solution.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove or disprove the existence of a sequence {p_n} with those three properties. So the assumptions would be the conditions on f (i.e., f is C^1 and increasing), and the problem part is to address the existence of the sequence with those three properties. Wait, but in the example, they included both the conditions on n (the assumptions) and the problem is to prove divisibility. So in this case, the problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is the actual question.\n\nSo here, the given is that f is in C^1([0,1]) and f is increasing. Then the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of the sequence with the three properties. But how to structure this? The example included the problem's own conditions as part of the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example had a mistake? Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was modified for some reason. Hmm, maybe the user who provided the example made an error, but I have to follow their format regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, there was a miscommunication. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So in the current problem, the original problem states that f is in C^1([0,1]) and increasing, and the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of the sequence with those properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. f is in C^1([0,1]).\n2. f is an increasing function on [0,1].\n\nThen, the problem part is to prove or disprove the existence of the sequence {p_n} with the three properties: each p_n is non-decreasing, degree of p_n is n, and the uniform error is O(1/n).\n\nBut in the example, they included both the general condition (n is an integer) and a specific condition (n divisible by 7). Wait, in the original example problem, the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have a different example. But since the user provided that example, perhaps they intended that the assumptions include all the conditions, even if in the original problem it's part of the quantifier.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user says \"Let f in C^1([0,1]) be an increasing function...\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n- f is in C^1([0,1]).\n- f is increasing on [0,1].\n\nAnd then the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of the sequence {p_n} with the three properties:\n\n1. p_n is non-decreasing on [0,1].\n2. The degree of p_n is n.\n3. ||f - p_n||_infty = O(1/n).\n\nSo in the Assumption section, we list the given conditions on f. The problem statement is to address the existence under those assumptions. The required properties of p_n are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. So perhaps in that example, the user made a mistake. But in the current case, we need to follow the instruction: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. The problem is the actual question to solve.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the original problem states that f is in C^1([0,1]) and is increasing. Then, the problem is to prove or disprove the existence of the sequence with those three properties.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is an element of $\\mathcal{C}^1([0,1])$,\n- $f$ is an increasing function over $[0,1]$.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove the existence of a sequence of real polynomials $\\{p_n(x)\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ with the properties:\n1. $p_n(x)$ is a non-decreasing function over $[0,1]$,\n2. The degree of $p_n$ is $n$,\n3. $\\|f - p_n\\|_{\\infty} = \\max_{x\\in[0,1]}|f(x) - p_n(x)| = O\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet point in the assumption should be a separate line. Also, in the problem statement, the properties are part of the problem's requirements. So the user is to prove or disprove that such a sequence exists given the assumptions on f. Therefore, the problem part should encapsulate all the required properties of the sequence {p_n}.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was rephrased to include the conclusion. So perhaps here, the problem statement is the main question, incorporating the required properties. Therefore, the answer should structure the problem as per the example.",
