    "Content": "Let $V$ be a finite dimensional inner-product space, and suppose that $T_1$, $T_2$ are normal operators on $V$ that commute. How to show that $T_1+T_2$ and $T_1T_2$ are then normal? It is clear if $T_1$ commutes with $T_2^*$ and $T_2$ with $T_1^*$, but is it true? If yes how to prove it? Edit: It is an exercise in Schaum's Outlines of Linear Algebra.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "My preferred answer was given by Robert Israel, as it is a great opportunity to meet the Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum Theorem . Here is an interpolation argument in the finite-dimensional case where you stand. I will first prove a lemma for matrices. Of course, the same holds for operators on a finite-dimensional complex inner-product space. Lemma: a matrix $A\\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is normal if and only if there exists a polynomial $P\\in \\mathbb{C}[X]$ such that $A^*=P(A)$. Proof: the implication $\\Leftarrow$ is obvious. So assume $A$ is normal. Equivalently, there exists a unitary matrix $U$ and a diagonal matrix $D=\\mbox{Diag}\\{\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n\\}$ such that $A=UDU^*$. Then $A^*=UD^*U^*$ where $D^*=\\mbox{Diag}\\{\\overline{\\lambda_1},\\ldots,\\overline{\\lambda_n}\\}$.\nBy Lagrange interpolation , we can find a polynomial $P\\in\\mathbb{C}[X]$ such that $P(\\lambda_j)=\\overline{\\lambda_j}$ for $j=1,\\ldots,n$. Hence $D^*=P(D)$ and it follows that $$P(A)=P(UDU^*)=UP(D)U^*=UD^*U^*=A^*.$$\nQED. Now assume that $T$ is normal and commutes with $S$. Then $S$ commutes with every power of $T$, hence with every polynomial in $T$. By the above, $S$ commutes with $T^*$. The facts you want to prove follow easily. Note: this remains true in $\\mathbb{R}$. But note that we need to be a little bit careful as real normal matrices are not diagonalizable in $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ in general.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The original question is about showing that if two normal operators commute, then their sum and product are also normal. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions that V is a finite-dimensional inner-product space. So that's one assumption. Then T1 and T2 are normal operators on V. Each of these should be separate assumptions. Also, T1 and T2 commute. Since they are two different operators, their commutativity is another assumption. \n\nWait, the example given had assumptions each addressing one property for one object. So maybe breaking down each operator's normality and their commutativity. Let me check:\n\nAssumptions:\n- V is a finite-dimensional inner-product space.\n- T1 is a normal operator on V.\n- T2 is a normal operator on V.\n- T1 and T2 commute.\n\nProblem: Prove that T1 + T2 and T1T2 are normal operators.\n\nBut wait, the original question also mentions that it's not clear if T1 commutes with T2* and T2 commutes with T1*. The user is asking if that's true and how to prove it. However, in the problem statement as given, the task is to show that T1+T2 and T1T2 are normal under the initial assumptions. The edit mentions it's an exercise in Schaum's Outline, so perhaps the key is that when two normal operators commute, their adjoints also commute? Because normality implies that T1* commutes with T2 if T1 commutes with T2, maybe? Hmm. But the assumptions in the problem as stated don't include that T1 commutes with T2*, only that T1 and T2 commute. So to structure the problem correctly, we need to take the original problem's given assumptions and list them, filtering out any extraneous info.\n\nThe user's question clarifies whether T1 commutes with T2* and T2 commutes with T1*, and if that's true, how to prove it. But the main problem is to show T1+T2 and T1T2 are normal given T1 and T2 are normal and commute. However, the user's confusion is about whether commutativity of T1 and T2 implies commutativity with each other's adjoints. But in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove that T1+T2 and T1T2 are normal under the original assumptions. So maybe the answer to the user's question (if T1 commutes with T2*, etc.) is part of the solution, but the problem as posed is to prove the normality under the given conditions. Therefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be exactly what is given in the problem statement, not including the user's doubts.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional inner-product space,\nT1 is a normal operator on V,\nT2 is a normal operator on V,\nT1 and T2 commute.\n\nProblem: Prove that T1 + T2 and T1T2 are normal operators.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"if T1, T2 are normal operators that commute then T1+T_2 and T1T_2 are normal.\" So yes, that's exactly the problem. The user's additional questions about commuting with adjoints are part of their thought process but not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the four assumptions as listed, and the problem statement as given.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, each applying to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a finite-dimensional inner-product space,\nT1 is a normal operator on V,\nT2 is a normal operator on V,\nT1 and T2 commute.\n\nProblem: Prove that T1 + T2 and T1T2 are normal operators.\n\nYes, that seems right. The user's edit mentions it's an exercise, so the key points are the normal operators commuting, leading to the sum and product being normal. The part about commuting with adjoints is part of the solution steps, perhaps, but not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the four assumptions as above.",
