Then $\\mathcal{O}=f^{-1}(I)$ , where $I$ is the identity matrix. Since $f$ is continuous, $\\mathcal{O}$ is closed as a preimage of a singleton. Since $\\|Qx\\|=\\|x\\|$ for each orthogonal matrix $Q$ , $\\mathcal{O}$ lies in the 1-ball, i.e. is bounded. Heine-Borel says that $\\mathcal{O}$ is compact. Since all norms in finite-dimensional vector spaces are equivalent it doesn't matter that we used the operator norm.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read it carefully first. The title is \"Orthogonal matrices form a compact set\" and the question is asking to prove that the set of all n×n orthogonal matrices is a compact subset of ℝ^{n²}. The user also mentions they don't know how to approach it and thanks. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem is about orthogonal matrices. So, the main objects here are orthogonal matrices of size n×n. What defines an orthogonal matrix? Well, an orthogonal matrix Q satisfies Q^T Q = I, where Q^T is the transpose and I is the identity matrix. That's the key property.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that the set of these matrices is compact in ℝ^{n²}. Compactness in Euclidean space (which ℝ^{n²} is) requires the set to be closed and bounded (by Heine-Borel theorem). So, the assumptions should include the properties of orthogonal matrices that lead to these two conditions.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The set in question is all n×n orthogonal matrices. So, each matrix Q in this set satisfies Q^T Q = I. That's one assumption: Each matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I (orthogonality condition).\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the set being compact. To use Heine-Borel, we need the set to be closed and bounded. So, the user might not have mentioned these, but the problem is to prove compactness, so the assumptions would be the defining properties of orthogonal matrices. The problem is to show that under these properties, the set is closed and bounded.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So, in this case, the assumptions should be the properties of the objects involved. Let me check.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the set of orthogonal matrices is compact. The key assumptions are:\n\n- The set consists of n×n orthogonal matrices. Each such matrix Q satisfies Q^T Q = I. So that's one assumption: Each matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nAdditionally, in the context of ℝ^{n²}, we can consider these matrices as vectors in n²-dimensional space. The topology here is the standard Euclidean topology. But the user might not have mentioned this, so maybe the assumption is that the space is ℝ^{n²} with the usual topology.\n\nWait, but the problem states that it's a subset of ℝ^{n²}, so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the main assumption is that each matrix in the set is orthogonal (i.e., Q^T Q = I).\n\nBut maybe also, the problem is for any n, but n is fixed here. So another assumption is that n is a fixed positive integer.\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify any other conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is that the matrices are orthogonal. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem given as an example, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example was incorrect? Or perhaps the original problem had a different statement. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction here.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user intended to extract the conditions from the problem. For instance, if the problem had said \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", then the assumptions would be n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the example given, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the formatted problem's assumptions were incorrect. Hmm. But I have to proceed as per the user's example, even if it's possibly erroneous.\n\nSo, applying that here, the problem is to prove that the set of orthogonal matrices is compact. The assumptions would be the properties that define orthogonal matrices. So each matrix in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I. So that's one assumption. The other thing is that the matrices are n×n, so n is a fixed positive integer. But in the example, they listed the assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix Q in the set is an n×n orthogonal matrix (i.e., Q^T Q = I).\n\nBut maybe also that n is a fixed positive integer, but since the problem is about the set of n×n orthogonal matrices, n is given. But perhaps in the problem statement, n is any positive integer. Wait, but the problem is for a fixed n. The set is all n×n orthogonal matrices. So n is fixed here. So maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, in the example, they listed n as an integer and then another condition. Here, since the problem is about matrices of size n×n, maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer, and each matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumption is just that each matrix Q is orthogonal, which implies Q^T Q = I, and the problem is to show compactness. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nEach matrix Q in the set is an n×n orthogonal matrix.\n\nBut to break it down into separate assumptions per line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, as per the user's instruction. So:\n\nAssumption:\nQ is an n×n matrix,\nQ satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nBut the problem states \"the set of all n×n orthogonal matrices\". So perhaps each matrix in the set is an orthogonal matrix, which means Q^T Q = I, and the matrices are n×n. So each of these could be separate assumptions. So:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix in the set is an n×n matrix,\nEach matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nBut in the example, they had two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" So here, similarly, we can split into two assumptions: one about the matrices being n×n, and another about them being orthogonal. However, being orthogonal is a property of the matrices, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe set consists of n×n matrices,\nEach matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nBut maybe the first assumption is redundant because the problem already says \"the set of all n×n orthogonal matrices\". So maybe the main assumption is that each matrix Q in the set is orthogonal, i.e., Q^T Q = I. But perhaps we need to specify that the matrices are n×n. So, breaking into two lines:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix Q in the set is an n×n matrix,\nEach matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\n\nThat would fit the format where each assumption is one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the first line specifies the size of the matrices, the second specifies their orthogonality.\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that this set is a compact subset of ℝ^{n²}.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach matrix Q in the set is an n×n matrix,\nEach matrix Q in the set satisfies Q^T Q = I.\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all n×n orthogonal matrices is a compact subset of ℝ^{n²}.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Prove that the set of all n × n orthogonal matrices is a compact subset of ℝ^{n²}.\" So the assumptions are inherent in the definition of the set. Therefore, the assumptions would be exactly those defining the set: that the matrices are n×n and orthogonal. So yes, two separate lines.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be structured as such.",
