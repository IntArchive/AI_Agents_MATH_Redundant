    "Content": "In Problem $3.14$ , we prove (a) Hardy's inequality, (b) the condition for equality, and I shall talk about (c), (d) below. Problem $3.15$ is the discrete case of Hardy's inequality. I have asked three related questions in a single post itself, since all of them are related to Hardy's inequality , and none should be too involved. There are some existing posts on MSE related to these topics, so I shall link them right away and point out that my question is not a duplicate: Post 1 , Post 2 , Post 3 , Post 4 . For the sake of mentioning it, Hardy's inequality is: For $p\\in (1,\\infty)$ , $f\\in L^p((0,\\infty))$ relative to the Lebesgue measure, and $$F(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\int_0^x f(t)\\ dt\\quad (0 < x < \\infty)$$ we have $$\\|F\\|_p \\le \\frac{p}{p-1} \\|f\\|_p$$ Question 1: This is Problem $3.14(c)$ in Rudin's book. Prove that the constant $p/(p-1)$ cannot be replaced by a smaller one. In one of the linked posts, there is some discussion on how this is the best constant, but I was unable to follow it. My sense is that it suffices to find a counterexample, i.e. for every constant $\\beta$ smaller than $p/(p-1)$ , we need a function $f_\\beta\\in L^p((0,\\infty))$ which does not satisfy the required inequality. Why are we complicating things? If I'm thinking right, could someone help me find a counterexample ? Question 2: This appears as Problem $3.14(d)$ of Rudin's book. The author is trying to emphasize that the inequality is not for $p = 1$ . If $f > 0$ and $f\\in L^1$ , prove that $F\\notin L^1$ . I found an example, $f(x) = e^{-x}$ . Then $F(x) = \\frac{1-e^{-x}}{x}$ . $F$ 's integral diverges, since the integral of $1/x$ diverges (use limit comparison test for integrals). However, as @David C. Ullrich pointed out, this is not enough. Question 3: This is Problem $3.15$ in the same book and is the discrete case of Hardy's inequality. Suppose $\\{a_n\\}$ is a sequence of positive numbers. Prove that $$\\sum_{N=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n \\right)^p \\le \\left(\\frac{p}{p-1} \\right)^p \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^p$$ if $1 < p < \\infty$ . If $a_n\\ge a_{n+1}$ , the result can be made to follow from Hardy's inequality. This special case implies the general one. I took $f = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\mathbf{1}_{[n,n+1]}$ . Then $f\\in L^p$ only if $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a^p_n < \\infty$ . If $f\\notin L^p$ , the inequality is trivial. So let's take $f\\in L^p$ . Now using Hardy's inequality, we have $\\|F\\|_p \\le \\frac{p}{p-1} \\|f\\|_p$ . What is $F$ ? $$F(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\int_0^x \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n\\mathbf{1}_{[n,n+1]}(t)\\ dt = \\frac{1}{x}\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\lfloor x\\rfloor} a_n + (x - \\lfloor x\\rfloor)a_{\\lfloor x\\rfloor + 1} \\right)$$ How do I proceed? P.S. I have already solved Problems $3.14(a)$ and $3.14(b)$ , i.e. proving Hardy's inequality and showing that equality holds iff $f = 0$ a.e.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "May details are left to you. The important part is that you review Post 4 where they show why $p/(p-1)$ is the best contact in Hardy's inequality. I give a brief explanation (but do not re do any of the constructions there) of why this is the case. Question 1: The answers to the Post 4 (one of which follow the Hint of your textbook) gives the optimal bound in Hardy's inequality. To see this, notice that each solution there explicitly constructs a sequence of functions $\\{f_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}\\subset L_p$ , such that $\\|f_n\\|_p=1$ , and $\\lim_n\\|Hf_n\\|_p=\\frac{p}{p-1}$ . If the bound $p/(p-1)$ were not optimal, and say $\\|Hf\\|_p\\leq c\\|f\\|_p$ for all $f\\in L_p$ , for some constant $c<\\frac{p}{p-1}$ , then for any of the sequences built in the aforementioned posting, you would have  that $$c\\|f_n\\|=c\\geq \\|Hf_n\\|_p\\xrightarrow{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{p}{p-1}$$ which is a contradiction to $c<p/(p-1)$ . Question 3: suppose $\\{a_n:n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a monotone non increasing sequence of positive numbers  such that $\\sum_na^p_n<\\infty$ , and define $f$ as $$\nf(x):=\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}a_n\\mathbb{1}_{(n-1,n]}(x)$$ and consider the Hardy transform $Hf$ of $f$ , i.e., $Hf(x):=\\frac1x\\int^x_0f(t)\\,dt$ Then $$Hf(x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\na_1 &\\text{if}&0<x\\leq1\\\\\n\\tfrac{a_1+\\ldots + a_n+(x-n)a_{n+1}}{x} & \\text{if} &1\\leq n<x\\leq n+1\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right.\n$$ The assumption on $a_n$ implies that for $1\\leq n<x\\leq n+1$ $$\\begin{align}\n\\frac{a_1+\\ldots + a_n+(x-n)a_{n+1}}{x}&=\\frac{(a_1-a_{n+1})+\\ldots +(a_n-a_{n+1})}{x}+a_{n+1}\\\\\n&\\geq \\frac{a_1+\\ldots+ a_n-na_{n+1}}{n+1} +a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_1+\\ldots + a_{n+1}}{n+1}\n\\end{align}$$ Hence $$\\begin{align}\n\\int^\\infty_0(Hf)^p&=\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\int^{n+1}_n(Hf)^p\\\\\n&\\geq\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\Big(\\frac1{n+1}\\sum^{n+1}_{k=1}a_k\\Big)^p\n=\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\Big(\\frac1{n}\\sum^{n}_{k=1}a_k\\Big)^p\n\\end{align}$$ Provided you have proved Hardy's inequality for $L_p((0,\\infty),\\mathscr{B}((0,\\infty),\\lambda)$ , where $\\lambda$ is Lebesgue's measure,  then\nThe conclusion of Question 2 follows for the special case $0\\leq a_{n+1}\\leq a_n$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ . See if you can get the general case ( $a_n\\geq0$ and $\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}a^p_n<\\infty$ ) from this (consider for example finite segments of $a_n$ , that is $b^{(m)}_n=a_n\\mathbb{1}_{(0,m]}(n)$ and apply the result to a \"reordering\" of $b^{(m)}$ ). Question 2: As David C. Ulrich mentioned in his comment and answer, the problem asks to show that $Hf\\notin L_1(0,\\infty)$ for all $f\\in L_1(0,\\infty)$ with $f>0$ . Here is a proof using Fubini's theorem. Since $g(t, x)=\\frac{1}{x}f(t)\\mathbb{1}_{(0,x]}(t)\\geq0\\,$ and  measurable in $(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ ,  one can iterate integrals to get \\begin{align}\n\\int^\\infty_0\\int^x_0\\frac{1}{x}f(t)\\,dt\\,dx&=\\int^\\infty_0\\int^\\infty_t\\frac{1}{x}f(t)\\,dx\\,dt=\\int^\\infty_0f(t)\\int^\\infty_t\\frac{1}{x}\\,dx\\,dt=\\infty\n\\end{align} A simpler proof is given by David C. Ulrich here Although not asked in the OP, one can easily show that the Hardy operator is of weak type (1,1), that is, there is a constant $C>0$ such that $\\displaystyle \\lambda(|Hf|> t)\\leq \\frac{C\\|f\\|_1}{t}$ for all $f\\in L_1(0,\\infty)$ where $\\lambda$ denotes Lebesgue measure. Indeed, since $$|Hf|\\leq\\frac1x\\int^x_0|f|\\,d\\lambda\\leq\\frac1x\\|f\\|_1,$$ $\\left\\{x>0:|Hf(x)|>t\\right\\}\\subset\\left\\{x>0: \\frac{\\|f\\|_1}{x}>t\\right\\}=\\left(0,\\frac{\\|f\\|_1}{t}\\right)$ . Consequently $$\\lambda(|Hf|> t)\\leq \\frac{\\|f\\|_1}{t}\\quad\\forall t>0$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this user's question. They want me to act as a math professor and structure their problem into the specified format. The original problem is from Hardy's Inequality in Rudin's book, specifically problems 3.14(c), 3.14(d), and 3.15. The user has three separate questions here, but they want each formatted individually. Let me look at each part.\n\nStarting with Question 1: 3.14(c). The task is to prove that the constant p/(p-1) in Hardy's inequality can't be replaced by a smaller one. The user mentions using a counterexample for any β < p/(p-1). The assumptions here would involve p being in (1, ∞), f in L^p, and F(x) defined as the integral average. But the key assumption for part (c) is that we need to show that for any smaller constant, there's a function where the inequality fails. So the assumption should focus on the problem's specific conditions. Wait, the original problem states to prove the constant is optimal. So the assumptions are p ∈ (1, ∞), f ∈ L^p((0,∞)), and F(x) defined as (1/x)∫₀ˣ f(t)dt. But the problem is about showing the constant can't be smaller. So maybe the assumption is just p ∈ (1, ∞) and f ∈ L^p. Then the problem is to show the constant is optimal, i.e., for any smaller β, there exists f where ||F||_p > β||f||_p.\n\nFor Question 2: 3.14(d). If f > 0 and f ∈ L^1, prove F ∉ L^1. Here, the key assumptions are f is positive, f ∈ L^1((0,∞)), and F(x) is the same integral average. The problem is to show F isn't integrable. The user tried f(x)=e^{-x}, but it's pointed out that this isn't sufficient. So maybe the assumption here is f is a positive L^1 function, and F is defined as usual. The problem is to prove F isn't in L^1.\n\nQuestion 3: 3.15 is the discrete case. The problem is to prove the inequality for sequences {a_n} with a_n positive, 1 < p < ∞. The user tried to connect it to the continuous case by defining a step function f. The assumptions would be {a_n} is a sequence of positive numbers, 1 < p < ∞. The problem is to prove the given inequality. The user is stuck on connecting F(x) in the continuous case to the discrete sum. So the problem statement here is about the discrete inequality.\n\nNow, I need to structure each of these three questions into the specified format. Each should have their own Assumption and Problem sections. The user provided an example where assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. Let's break down each question:\n\nFor Question 1 (3.14c):\nAssumptions:\n- p is in the interval (1, ∞).\n- f is a function in L^p((0, ∞)) relative to Lebesgue measure.\n- F(x) is defined as (1/x)∫₀ˣ f(t) dt for 0 < x < ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the constant p/(p-1) in Hardy's inequality cannot be replaced by a smaller constant.\n\nFor Question 2 (3.14d):\nAssumptions:\n- f is a positive function.\n- f is in L^1((0, ∞)) relative to Lebesgue measure.\n- F(x) is defined as (1/x)∫₀ˣ f(t) dt for 0 < x < ∞.\n\nProblem:\nProve that F is not in L^1((0, ∞)).\n\nFor Question 3 (3.15):\nAssumptions:\n- {a_n} is a sequence of positive numbers.\n- p is in the interval (1, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{N=1}^∞ ( (1/N) ∑_{n=1}^N a_n )^p ≤ (p/(p-1))^p ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n^p.\n\nEach of these needs to be formatted properly. Let me check if I missed any assumptions. For example, in 3.14(c), the original problem states that the inequality is proven, and now we need to show the constant is optimal. So the assumptions are the same as in Hardy's inequality, but the problem is about the optimality. For 3.14(d), the key points are f is positive and in L^1. For 3.15, it's about the discrete case with positive a_n and p in (1, ∞). The problem is the inequality itself. The user's approach tried to link it to the continuous case via a step function, but they got stuck. So the problem here is to prove the inequality for the discrete case.\n\nI think that's all. Each part has its own assumptions and problem statement. Now, present them as per the format.",
