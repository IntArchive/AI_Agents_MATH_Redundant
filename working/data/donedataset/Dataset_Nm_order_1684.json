    "Content": "I wish to evaluate the integral $$I=\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2-1} \\ dx.$$ I used Mathematica's Rationalize command to see that it is equal to $5 \\pi^3/1296,$ but I do not know how to prove it analytically. Context The integral appears as part of an alternative expression for the triple integral $$J=\\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1}\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^2y}{\\sqrt{4-x^2}{\\sqrt{4-x^2y^2} \\sqrt{4-x^2y^2z^2}}} \\ dz \\ dy \\ dx.$$ It is easy to evaluate $J$ directly and show it is $\\frac{\\pi^3}{1296}.$ However, if we reverse the order of integration and integrate with respect to $y$ first, we get $$J=- \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2 z^2}+\\sqrt{4-x^2} z}{2 z+2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{4-x^2} z} \\ dz \\ dx.$$ The integral can be expanded into the triple integral $$- \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{0}^{z}\\frac{x^2}{z \\left(x^2 \\left(t^2 \\sqrt{4-x^2}+\\sqrt{4-t^2 x^2}\\right)-4\n   \\left(\\sqrt{4-t^2 x^2}+\\sqrt{4-x^2}\\right)\\right)} \\ dt \\ dz \\ dx.$$ Reversing the order of integration and integrating with respect to $x$ first, we can deduce \\begin{align*}\nJ &= \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{t}^{1}\\frac{\\frac{\\pi }{6} t-\\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{\\left(t-t^3\\right) z} \\ dz \\ dt  \\\\\n&= -\\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6} t \\log(t) -\\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right) \\log(t)}{t-t^3} \\ dt  \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\int_{0}^{1}\\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt + \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right) \\log(t)}{t-t^3} \\ dt \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi^3}{48} + \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{t \\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t^2-1} \\ dt,\n\\end{align*} in which we used the well-known result $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t)}{t^2-1} \\ dt = \\frac{\\pi^2}{8}$$ and partial fractions on the second integral term in the second to last equality. Recalling $J=\\pi^3/1296,$ rearranging gives $$\n\\begin{align*}\n-\\frac{13 \\pi ^3}{648} &=\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{t \\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t^2-1} \\ dt \\\\\n&=\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt - I.\n\\end{align*}$$ Question Upon using integrating by parts, it turns out $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt= -\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log^2(t)}{2\\sqrt{4-t^2}} \\ dt.$$ Further substituting $t=2 \\sin(\\theta)$ and using the answers in either Interesting log sine integrals $\\int_0^{\\pi/3} \\log^2 \\left(2\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\right)dx= \\frac{7\\pi^3}{108}$ or Finding $\\int^{1}_{0}\\frac{\\ln^2(x)}{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}dx$ , we can deduce $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt = -\\frac{7 \\pi^3}{432}.$$ Hence, assuming this, we can get $$I= \\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}.$$ Can we evaluate $I$ without knowing the value of the integral $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log (t) \\sin ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)}{t} \\ dt$ ? Can $I$ be evaluated with real methods ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Step 1. Substituting $x = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)$ and noting that \\begin{align*}\n\\arcsin(x/2)\\log(x)\n&= (\\theta/2) \\log(2\\sin(\\theta/2)) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{i} \\log(e^{i\\theta/2}) \\log\\bigl(i(e^{-i\\theta/2} - e^{i\\theta/2})\\bigr) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\operatorname{Im}\\left[ \\log^2\\bigl(i(1 - e^{i\\theta})\\bigr) \\right]\n\\end{align*} for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$ , the integral is recast as \\begin{align*}\nI\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{1-2\\cos\\theta} \\operatorname{Im}\\left[ \\log^2 \\left( i(1 - e^{i\\theta}) \\right) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta.\n\\end{align*} Here, $\\log(\\cdot)$ is the principal logarithm. To utilize this, for $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ , we introduce the following auxiliary integral $$ J_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{3}-\\epsilon} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{1-2\\cos\\theta} \\left( \\log (1 - e^{i\\theta}) + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta. $$ $J_{\\epsilon}$ is related to $I$ by the relation $I = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+}\\operatorname{Im}(J_{\\epsilon})$ . Step 2. Unfortunately, $J_{\\epsilon}$ diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ since its real part does. The key idea in the next step is to decompose $J_{\\epsilon}$ that allows to separate the diverging real part from $J_{\\epsilon}$ . Consider the curve $\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}$ in $\\mathbb{C}$ which is defined by $\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}(\\theta) = 1 - e^{i\\theta}$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{3}-\\epsilon$ , and substitute $z = \\gamma_{\\varepsilon}(\\theta)$ . Then \\begin{align*}\nJ_{\\epsilon}\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2i}\\bigl((1-z) - \\frac{1}{1-z}\\bigr)}{1-\\bigl((1-z) + \\frac{1}{1-z}\\bigr)} \\left(\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{i(z-1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}} \\left( \\frac{3z^2}{z^3+1} - \\frac{2z}{z^2-1} \\right) \\left(\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z \\\\\n&= A_{\\epsilon} - B_{\\epsilon},\n\\end{align*} where $A_{\\epsilon}$ and $B_{\\epsilon}$ are defined by $$ A_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}} \\frac{3z^2}{z^3+1} \\left(\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nB_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}} \\frac{2z}{z^2-1} \\left(\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z. $$ To further simplify these integrals, we observe that $$ \\log z = \\frac{1}{2}\\log(z^2) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log (-z^3) - \\frac{i\\pi}{3} \\qquad \\text{for } z \\in \\gamma_{\\epsilon}. $$ Here, the last step is a consequence of the branch cut of $\\log(\\cdot)$ together with the fact that the contours corresponding to $\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}$ , $\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}^2$ , and $-\\gamma_{\\varepsilon}^3$ are as follows: So, by applying further substitutions $-z^3 \\mapsto z$ and $z^2 \\mapsto z$ to $A_{\\epsilon}$ and $B_{\\epsilon}$ , respectively, we get \\begin{align*}\nA_{\\epsilon} &= \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{-\\gamma_{\\epsilon}^3} \\frac{1}{z-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{6} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z, \\\\\nB_{\\epsilon} &= \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{\\gamma_{\\epsilon}^2} \\frac{1}{z-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z.\n\\end{align*} Step 3. For $A_{\\varepsilon}$ , the integrand has a simple pole at $z = 1$ . Moreover, the terminal point of $-\\gamma_{\\epsilon}^3$ has an asymptotic formula of the form $$ -(1-e^{i(\\pi/3 - \\epsilon)})^3\n= 1 - 3e^{i\\pi/6}\\epsilon + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)\n\\qquad \\text{as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.} $$ So by replacing $-\\gamma_{\\epsilon}^3$ by the union of $z = x$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1-3\\epsilon$ , which is the line segment from $0$ to $1-3\\epsilon$ ; $z = 1 - 3\\epsilon e^{i\\theta}$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ , which is the circular arc from $1-3\\epsilon$ to $1-3\\epsilon e^{i\\pi/6}$ ; the line segment from $1-3\\epsilon e^{i\\pi/6}$ to the terminal point of $-\\gamma_{\\epsilon}^3$ ; it follows that \\begin{align*}\n&A_{\\epsilon} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{0}^{1-3\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{x-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\log x + \\frac{i\\pi}{6} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n + \\frac{i}{4} \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\log(1 - 3\\epsilon e^{i\\varphi}) + \\frac{i\\pi}{6} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\varphi\n + \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon) \\\\\n&= \\frac{i\\pi}{36} \\int_{0}^{1-3\\epsilon} \\frac{\\log x}{x-1} \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n+ \\frac{i}{4} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\left( \\frac{i\\pi}{6} \\right)^2\n+ \\text{[some real number]}\n+ \\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon).\n\\end{align*} As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ , its imaginary part converges to $$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\operatorname{Im} (A_{\\epsilon})\n= \\frac{\\pi}{36} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log x}{x-1} \\, \\mathrm{d}x - \\frac{\\pi^3}{864}\n= \\frac{\\pi^3}{288}.\n$$ Step 4. For $B_{\\epsilon}$ , its limit is simply $B_0$ . So, $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} B_{\\epsilon}\n= B_0\n= \\frac{1}{4} \\int_{0}^{e^{-2\\pi i/3}} \\frac{1}{z-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\log z + \\frac{i\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}z $$ Performing integration by parts twice, we end up with $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} B_{\\epsilon}\n= -\\frac{\\pi^2}{144}\\log\\bigl(1 - e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\bigr) + \\frac{i\\pi}{24} \\operatorname{Li}_2\\bigl( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\bigr) - \\frac{1}{8} \\operatorname{Li}_3\\bigl( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\bigr)$$ Although the exact value of $\\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\right)$ and $\\operatorname{Li}_3\\left( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\right)$ are not known, it only suffices to know the values of $\\operatorname{Re}\\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_2\\left( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\right) \\right]$ and $\\operatorname{Im}\\left[ \\operatorname{Li}_3\\left( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\right) \\right]$ . Moreover, these values can be computed using the Fourier series of the Bernoulli polynomials . The upshot of this observation is that $$ \\operatorname{Re}\\bigl[ \\operatorname{Li}_2\\bigl( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\bigr) \\bigr] = -\\frac{\\pi^2}{18}, \\qquad\n\\operatorname{Im}\\bigl[ \\operatorname{Li}_3\\bigl( e^{-2\\pi i/3} \\bigr) \\bigr] = -\\frac{2\\pi^3}{81}. $$ Putting altogether, we end up with $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\operatorname{Im}( B_{\\epsilon} ) = -\\frac{\\pi^3}{2592}, $$ Conclusion. Combining all the efforts and using the relation $$ I\n= \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\operatorname{Im}(J_{\\epsilon})\n= \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\operatorname{Im}(A_{\\epsilon} - B_{\\epsilon}), $$ the desired equality is proved.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and present it with Assumptions and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, looking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem here is about evaluating an integral I = ∫₀¹ [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)] / (x² - 1) dx and showing it equals 5π³/1296 without prior knowledge of another integral. The user also asks if real methods can be used.\n\nThe question mentions context with triple integrals and some steps involving integration by parts and substitutions, but the core problem is to evaluate I. The assumptions need to be extracted from the problem. Let me see:\n\n1. The integral I is defined from 0 to 1.\n2. The integrand is [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)] / (x² - 1).\n3. The user wants to evaluate I without using the known value of another integral ∫₀¹ [log(t) arcsin(t/2)] / t dt.\n4. The user is asking if real methods (as opposed to complex analysis) can be used.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, are there any implicit assumptions? For example, the integrand has arcsin(x/2), so x must be in [-2,2] for arcsin to be real, but since the integral is from 0 to 1, x is within 0 to 1, which is within [-2,2], so maybe that's an assumption. Also, the denominator x² -1 becomes zero at x=1, but the integral is up to 1, so there's a possible singularity at x=1. However, the problem might assume the integral converges, which it does as given by the result.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- The integral I is taken over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand involves arcsin(x/2), which is defined for x in [-2,2], and since x ∈ [0,1], this is valid.\n- The integral is convergent despite the denominator approaching zero at x=1.\n- The problem requires evaluating I without prior knowledge of the related integral involving log(t) arcsin(t/2)/t.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables (e.g., n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are more about the integrand's definition and convergence. However, since the problem is presented as given, maybe the main assumption is the integral's setup and the conditions under which it's evaluated. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user says, \"I wish to evaluate the integral...\" So the problem is to compute I = ... and they want to know if it can be done without referencing that other integral. The assumptions would be the conditions under which the integral is defined. Let's break it down line by line:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The integral I is ∫₀¹ [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)] / (x² - 1) dx.\n- arcsin(x/2) is defined for x ∈ [0,1] (since x/2 ∈ [0,0.5] ⊂ [-1,1]).\n- The integrand has singularities at x=1 (denominator x² -1 approaches 0), but the integral is convergent.\n- The evaluation must not use the value of ∫₀¹ [log(t) arcsin(t/2)] / t dt.\n- Real methods (as opposed to complex analysis) should be used if possible.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state all these; they are inferred from the context. However, the example given in the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's setup. For instance, in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the problem's integral is defined with certain conditions. So maybe the explicit assumptions here are:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval [0,1].\n- arcsin(x/2) is well-defined for x in [0,1].\n- The integral I converges.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as given, perhaps the key is to extract the problem statement and list the conditions necessary for it. However, the user's example didn't list all mathematical assumptions but those given in the problem. In the original example, the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Wait, actually, looking back, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that might not be correct because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Let me check.\n\nThe original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the example was wrong, and the user wants to correct that. Alternatively, maybe the example was from a modified problem where an assumption was added. Hmm, confusing. But regardless, for the current problem, I need to list the assumptions as per the given problem.\n\nThe problem here is to evaluate I = ∫₀¹ [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)] / (x² -1) dx = 5π³/1296, without using the known value of another integral. The user is asking if it's possible and if real methods can be used. So the problem is to evaluate I under these constraints.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral I is taken over x from 0 to 1.\n- arcsin(x/2) is defined for x in [0,1].\n- The integrand is [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)] / (x² - 1).\n- The integral is to be evaluated without using the known value of ∫₀¹ [log(t) arcsin(t/2)] / t dt.\n- Real methods are preferred for evaluation.\n\nBut since the problem is presented as \"evaluate I without knowing the value of the other integral\", the main assumptions are the integral's definition and the constraints on the method. The problem statement is as given, and the user wants to know if it's possible with real methods.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\n- $x$ is a real variable in the interval $[0, 1]$,\n- $\\arcsin(x/2)$ is defined for $x \\in [0, 1]$,\n- The integral $I$ converges,\n- The evaluation must not use the value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$,\n- Real methods are to be employed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2-1} \\ dx=\\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$$ using real methods and without utilizing the known value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$.\n\nBut the original problem's question is: \"Can we evaluate I without knowing the value of the integral...? Can I be evaluated with real methods?\" So the problem is to evaluate I under those two constraints.\n\nSo maybe the assumptions are more about the integral's setup, and the problem is to evaluate it under the specified constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the integral's definition and convergence, and the problem includes the constraints as part of the question.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the problem statement. Here, the problem's assumptions are inherent in the integral's definition. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral $I$ is defined as $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2 - 1} dx$,\n- $x$ is in the interval $[0, 1]$,\n- $\\arcsin(x/2)$ is well-defined for all $x$ in $[0, 1]$,\n- The integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate $I$ and show that it equals $\\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$ without using the known value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$ and using real methods.\n\nBut the problem as posed in the original question is two-part: Can I be evaluated without knowing the other integral, and can real methods be used? So the problem is to answer both questions, but in the format, we need to structure the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking for the formatted problem, the problem part should encapsulate the original request. Let me look at the original question's title and the main question.\n\nTitle: A Challenging Integral: ∫₀¹ [x arcsin(x/2) log(x)]/(x²−1) dx=5π³/1296\n\nQuestion: The user wants to evaluate I and asks if it can be done without knowing the other integral's value and with real methods.\n\nSo the Problem section should be:\n\nProblem: Evaluate the integral $$I=\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2-1} \\ dx$$ and show that it equals $\\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$ without using the value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} \\ dt$ and using real methods.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is just to evaluate I under those constraints, so:\n\nProblem: Evaluate $$I=\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2-1} \\ dx$$ without using the known value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} \\ dt$ and with real methods.\n\nBut the original problem also states that the integral is equal to 5π³/1296, so the problem is to prove that equality under the constraints.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove that I equals 5π³/1296, with the assumptions being the integral's setup and the constraints on method.\n\nSo final formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2 - 1} dx$,\n- The integral $I$ converges,\n- The evaluation must not use the value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$,\n- Real methods are to be used.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $I = \\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$.\n\nBut perhaps the first three assumptions are redundant as they are part of the problem's definition. Wait, the example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, n was any integer, but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like a mistake. So maybe in that example, the user intended to filter out the conditions? But in any case, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem.\n\nGiven the user's example seems to have possibly incorrect assumptions (adding n divisible by 7 when the original problem says \"for every integer n\"), but I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem's assumptions are the integral's definition and the constraints. The user's question is whether I can be evaluated without knowing that other integral and using real methods.\n\nTherefore, the problem is as stated, and the assumptions include the integral's definition and the constraints.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions should list properties or conditions applied to one object each. So each line is a separate assumption.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- $I$ is defined as $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2 - 1} dx$,\n- The variable $x$ ranges from $0$ to $1$,\n- $\\arcsin(x/2)$ is defined for $x \\in [0,1]$,\n- The integral $I$ converges,\n- The evaluation does not use the value of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$,\n- Real methods are employed in the evaluation.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $I = \\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$.\n\nHowever, the problem's original question is \"Can we evaluate I without knowing the value of the integral...? Can I be evaluated with real methods?\" So the problem is to determine if this is possible, but the user wants the problem structured as \"Prove that I = ...\" under the given assumptions.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility, and the formatted problem was the same with assumptions listed. So perhaps here, similarly, the problem is to prove that I equals the given value under the listed assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$I$ is defined as $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x \\arcsin(x/2) \\log(x)}{x^2 - 1} dx$,\n$x$ is in the interval $[0, 1]$,\n$\\arcsin(x/2)$ is well-defined for all $x$ in $[0, 1]$,\nThe integral $I$ is convergent,\nThe evaluation does not use the result of $\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{\\log(t) \\arcsin(t/2)}{t} dt$,\nReal methods are used in the evaluation.\nProblem:\nProve that $$I = \\frac{5 \\pi^3}{1296}$$.",
