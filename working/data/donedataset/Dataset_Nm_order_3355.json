    "Content": "I asked this question on puzzling.se and someone suggested I post it here: I discovered this by accident, when trying to create a formula that generates prime numbers (an impossible task, I know). But, I find it very interesting that you take any prime number 5 and greater, then you square it and subtract 1, dividing it by 24 always results in a whole integer. For example: 5 x 5 = 25 - 1 = 24 / 24 = 1\n7 x 7 = 49 - 1 = 48 / 24 = 2\n11 x 11 = 121 - 1 = 120 / 24 = 50 The result is always a whole number, regardless of how high the prime number is. Can someone explain why this is so, mathematically? This does not seem possible (to me). And if this is really true, why can I find nothing written about it? I have never heard of this theorem before, and nothing is mentioned on Wikipedia or other sources. But perhaps this could be a helpful in reducing $33\\%$ of the possibilities when trying to find or prove large prime numbers, computationally. UPDATE: lab made the observation that all resulting numbers are apparently also divisible by $24$ ..  interesting UPDATE: following lab's observation , I tried $24 \\times 24 = 576 + 1 = 577$  ( a prime number)  .. interesting  and..  $576 \\times 576 + 1 = 331,777$ which is also a prime Further extrapolating in the gap of numbers between $2$ and $50$: primes: 24 x 3 = 72 + 1 = 73  72 - 1 = 71  72 + 7 = 79\n24 x 4 = 96 + 1 = 97   96 + 5 = 101  96 + 7 = 103   \n24 x 5 = 120 - 7 = 113  120 + 7 = 121\n24 x 6 = 144 - 7 = 137  144 + 7 = 151\n24 x 7 = 168 - 1 = 167  168 + 5 = 173\n24 x 8 = 192 - 1 = 191  192 + 5 = 197\n24 x 9 = 216 + 7 = 223 Not a perfect formula for finding primes, but seems to be effective :-)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Any integer can be expressed as $6n,6n\\pm1,6n\\pm2,6n+3$ where $n$ is any integer Observe that, any prime number $>3,$ can be expressed as $6n\\pm1$ Now, $(6n\\pm1)^2=36n^2\\pm12n+1=24n^2+24\\dfrac{n(n\\pm1)}2+1\\equiv1\\pmod{24}$ So, any integer of the form $6n\\pm1$ will satisfy the proposition, we don't even need primes",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user is talking about prime numbers 5 and higher. When you square them and subtract 1, the result is divisible by 24. So first, I need to list all the assumptions.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition. The problem mentions primes 5 and higher. So the first assumption is that the prime number p is greater than or equal to 5. Then, since primes are greater than 3, they are either 1 or -1 mod 6, but maybe more relevant here, primes greater than 3 are not divisible by 2 or 3. Wait, but primes higher than 5 are still primes, so they can be considered as being of the form 6k ± 1, but maybe that's part of the reasoning for the problem. However, the key assumptions for the problem are: p is a prime number, p is at least 5. The problem is to prove that p squared minus 1 is divisible by 24.\n\nThe user also mentions that dividing by 24 gives a whole integer, so the problem is to show that 24 divides p² - 1 for primes p ≥ 5. \n\nLooking at the example given in the original problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" but that was part of the problem's specific conditions. In this case, the key conditions are p is prime and p ≥ 5. So the assumptions should list that p is a prime number, and p is at least 5. Those are two separate assumptions. Wait, but maybe the fact that p is prime and greater than 3 implies certain properties. However, the problem states primes 5 and higher. So the two assumptions are p is a prime number, and p ≥ 5. \n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\np is greater than or equal to 5.\n\nProblem:\nProve that when you square p and subtract 1, the result is divisible by 24. In other words, show that p² - 1 is divisible by 24.\n\nWait, the original problem's title says \"every prime number (5 and higher) divisible by 24 when you square it and subtract 1\". So yes, exactly. So the problem is to prove that p² - 1 is divisible by 24 for primes p ≥ 5.\n\nChecking for possible other assumptions. For example, maybe the user mentioned that primes are odd numbers. But since primes greater than 2 are odd, that's a property, but maybe it's considered an assumption here. However, in the example given, the user didn't list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in the current problem, the main assumptions are the primality and the lower bound. The fact that primes ≥5 are odd is a consequence of being prime and greater than 2, so perhaps that's not listed as a separate assumption. The user might not need to state that p is odd since it's implied by being a prime greater than 2. So the key explicit assumptions are p is prime and p ≥5.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\np is greater than or equal to 5.\n\nProblem:\nProve that p² - 1 is divisible by 24.\n\nNow, check if the original question includes any other conditions. The user mentioned primes 5 and higher, so that's covered. The problem is exactly as stated. The user's updates mention other observations, but those are perhaps part of their exploration, not part of the problem's assumptions. The main problem is to explain why p² -1 is divisible by 24 for primes p ≥5. So the formatted problem is correct.",
