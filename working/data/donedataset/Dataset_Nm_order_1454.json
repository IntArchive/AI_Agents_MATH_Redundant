    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the element $z =y^{-1}xy$, we have: $z^2 = (y^{-1}xy)^2 = (y^{-1}xy)(y^{-1}xy) = e$. So: $z = x$, and $y^{-1}xy = x$. So: $xy = yx$. So: $x$ is in the center of $G$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The question is to prove that if a group has exactly one element of order 2, then that element must be in the center of the group. The center means it commutes with every other element in the group.\n\nSo, given a group G, there's exactly one element x such that the order of x is 2. That means x² = e, where e is the identity, and x is not equal to e. Also, there are no other elements in G with order 2 besides x. We need to show that for any element y in G, xy = yx.\n\nHmm, let's think about group theory concepts here. Maybe conjugation? Because conjugation is an automorphism, so if I take yxy⁻¹, that should have the same order as x. Since x has order 2, then yxy⁻¹ also has order 2. But wait, the group has only one element of order 2, which is x itself. So yxy⁻¹ must be equal to x. Therefore, yx = xy. That seems straightforward. Let me check if that works.\n\nLet me go through it step by step. Take any element y in G. Consider the conjugate of x by y, which is yxy⁻¹. The order of yxy⁻¹ is the same as the order of x, which is 2. But since there's only one element of order 2 in G, this conjugate must be x. Therefore, yxy⁻¹ = x. Multiplying both sides on the right by y, we get yx = xy. So x commutes with y. Since y was arbitrary, x is in the center of G.\n\nWait, that seems too easy. Did I miss something? Let me verify. The key point is that conjugation preserves the order of elements. So if x has order 2, its conjugate also has order 2. Since there's only one such element, the conjugate must be x itself. Therefore, conjugation by any y fixes x, which is exactly the condition that x is central. Yeah, that works. So maybe the answer is to use the conjugation argument. But maybe the original problem didn't mention conjugation, so the user might not be familiar. Let me see the original question again.\n\nThe user mentioned they tried a few things but didn't get anywhere. They started by noting that x² = e and x inverse is x. Maybe they tried manipulating the equation x·y = y·x directly. Let me think of another approach without conjugation. Suppose we take an arbitrary element y in G and consider the element yxy⁻¹. But maybe they haven't considered conjugation. Alternatively, consider the element y⁻¹xy. Wait, that's the same as conjugation. So perhaps that's the standard approach here.\n\nAlternatively, consider the element xy. Let's compute its order. If x and y commute, then (xy)² = x²y² = ey² = y². But if they don't commute, then (xy)² = x y x y. Hmm, not sure. Wait, but if we can show that x commutes with y, maybe by considering that xyx⁻¹ = y? Wait, but x is its own inverse, so xyx would be xyx. Hmm, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that x does not commute with y. Then the element x y x⁻¹ would be different from y. But x y x⁻¹ is another element of the group. Let's see, but how does that help? Maybe consider the elements x and yxy⁻¹. If x is the only element of order 2, then yxy⁻¹ must equal x. So, yx = xy. That's the same argument as before.\n\nAlternatively, take the element z = y⁻¹x y. Then z has order 2, so z must be x. Therefore, y⁻¹x y = x, so multiplying both sides by y, we get x y = y x. That's the same as conjugation.\n\nSo maybe this is the standard approach. Therefore, the key idea is that conjugating x by any element gives an element of order 2, which must be x itself, hence x is central.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by this conjugation argument. The assumptions are that the group G has exactly one element of order 2, which is x. So in the problem statement, the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- There exists exactly one element x in G such that the order of x is 2.\n- The center of G consists of all elements that commute with every element in G.\n\nBut the problem is to show that x is in the center. So in the Assumption section, we need to list each condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nThere exists an element x in G such that x has order 2,\nNo other element in G has order 2,\nThe center of G is the set of elements commuting with all elements in G.\n\nBut the problem is just: Prove that x is in the center of G. Wait, but in the original problem statement, they already state \"if a group contains exactly one element of order 2, then that element is in the center\". So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG contains exactly one element x with order 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x is in the center of G.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in that example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7; the user added that as an assumption. Wait, no. Wait, in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check again.\n\nWait the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But that seems like maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the user wants the assistant to process the given problem into the Assumption and Problem sections, filtering out unrelated information.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is: Prove that if a group contains exactly one element of order 2, then that element is in the center of the group.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n- G is a group.\n- There exists exactly one element x in G such that the order of x is 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x is in the center of G.\n\nBut the user's example split assumptions into lines, each line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nG contains exactly one element x with order 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x is in the center of G.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement is already concise. However, maybe we need to break down the assumptions into individual lines. Let's see.\n\nThe group G is a group. The group G contains exactly one element of order 2. The element x is that unique element. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nThere exists an element x in G such that x has order 2,\nNo element in G other than x has order 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that x is in the center of G.\n\nYes, that's breaking down the assumptions. Each line is a separate assumption. First, G is a group. Second, there's an element x with order 2. Third, no other elements have order 2. Then the problem is to show x is in the center.\n\nSo the formatted problem should look like that.",
