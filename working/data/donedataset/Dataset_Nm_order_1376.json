    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose $c>0$. If $x > \\frac{c}{2}$, then $|\\frac{1}{x}-\\frac{1}{c}|= \\frac{|x-c|}{xc} < \\frac{2}{c^2}|x-c|$ So, if $\\epsilon>0$, choose $\\delta < \\min(\\frac{c^2\\epsilon }{2},\\frac{c}{2})$, then if $|x-c|< \\delta$, we have (i) $x > \\frac{c}{2}$, and from above we have (ii) $|\\frac{1}{x}-\\frac{1}{c}| < \\frac{2}{c^2}\\delta \\le \\epsilon $. A similar argument applies to $c<0$. Or you could use the fact that $f(x) = -f(-x)$, and use the fact that multiplication by a constant ($-1$, in this case) is continuous, and composition of continuous functions is continuous.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about showing that the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous at any point c not equal to zero. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that f is defined from R to R, so f: R → R. The function is given as f(x) = 1/x. The continuity is to be shown at any c ≠ 0. The notice mentions choosing delta to stay away from 0, which might be a hint for the solution but isn't an assumption. \n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n1. The function f is defined as f(x) = 1/x.\n2. The domain and codomain of f are both R (real numbers), but we have to exclude 0 from the domain since f(x) is undefined there. However, the problem specifies c ≠ 0, so the function is defined in a neighborhood around c, just not at 0.\n3. The point c at which continuity is to be shown is any real number except 0.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"f: R → R\", but actually, f(x)=1/x can't be defined at x=0. So maybe the correct domain is R \\ {0}. The user might have a typo there. But the problem as stated in the question says \"f: R→R\", which is technically incorrect. But since the problem mentions c ≠ 0, perhaps the intended domain is R \\ {0}. However, the user wrote \"f: R→R\", so maybe that's part of the problem's assumptions, even though it's not accurate. Hmm. Should I list that as an assumption? The problem might be assuming that f is defined on R except 0, but the user wrote R→R. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow what's given. Wait, looking at the original problem again: \"Show that f:R→R, f(x)=1/x is continuous at any c≠0\". So the problem states the function is from R to R, but with f(x)=1/x, which is impossible at x=0. So perhaps the actual domain is R\\{0}, but the problem statement says R→R. This might be an error, but as the assistant, I should stick to the problem as presented. So the assumptions would include that f is defined on R→R, but with f(x)=1/x, and continuity is considered at c≠0. However, this is contradictory because f(x)=1/x isn't defined on all of R. So maybe the correct assumption is that f is defined on R\\{0}→R. But the problem states f:R→R. Hmm, this is confusing. The user might have a typo here. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that f is defined on R with the understanding that at x=0, it's not defined, but the problem is only considering points where it is defined. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"f: R→R\", which is incorrect. However, since the problem is about continuity at c≠0, perhaps the actual domain is R\\{0}, but the problem statement is written incorrectly. As an assistant, should I correct this or follow exactly what's given? The user's example in the original query had an assumption where n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions should include that f is defined as f(x)=1/x for x≠0, and the problem is to show continuity at any c≠0. But the problem statement says \"f: R→R\", which is conflicting. Maybe the problem has a typo, but the user wants me to structure it as per the given. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that f is defined on R with the exception at x=0, but the mapping is still to R. So perhaps the correct assumption is that f is defined on R \\ {0} to R. But the problem statement says \"f: R→R\", which is not accurate. This is a problem. Since the user's example included assumptions from the problem, even if they were not explicitly stated, perhaps in this case, the assumptions should list that f is defined as f(x)=1/x for x ≠ 0, and c is a real number not equal to 0. But how to phrase that?\n\nLooking at the example given by the user: in the original problem, the example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem's statement only mentioned \"for every integer n\". Wait, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" In the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That changes the problem. Maybe the user's example is wrong, but I have to follow their structure. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a different assumption. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". The formatted problem in the example seems to incorrectly add that assumption, which changes the problem. That suggests that the user might have made a mistake in their example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not reliable, and I should instead follow the instructions given, which say to \"filter the unrelated information and structure the problem as the format\". So, in the current problem, the user's question is to show that f: R→R, f(x)=1/x is continuous at any c≠0. The assumptions here would be:\n\n1. f: R → R is defined by f(x) = 1/x for x ≠ 0 (even though the problem states f: R→R, which is incorrect, but perhaps we need to note that f is defined on R except 0).\n2. c is a real number such that c ≠ 0.\n\nBut how to phrase this correctly? The problem statement says \"f: R→R\", which is technically incorrect because 1/x is undefined at x=0. However, the problem is about continuity at c≠0, so perhaps the correct assumption is that f is defined on R\\{0} → R. But the problem as stated says \"f: R→R\". This is conflicting. Maybe the user intended the domain to be R\\{0}, but wrote R→R by mistake. As an assistant, should I correct this? Or follow the problem as written?\n\nGiven that the example provided by the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect, but the user included it, perhaps I should strictly follow the problem as stated, even if there's an error. So if the problem says \"f: R→R\", even though that's impossible for f(x)=1/x, then perhaps the assumption is that f is defined on R with some undefined points, but the problem is to consider continuity at c≠0. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written correctly, and the function is defined on R with the understanding that at x=0, it's not defined. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. f is a function from R to R defined by f(x) = 1/x for x ≠ 0.\n2. c is a real number where c ≠ 0.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"f: R→R\", which is technically incorrect. However, perhaps in the problem's context, they are considering f: R \\ {0} → R, but wrote it as R→R. To avoid confusion, maybe the assumption should state that f is defined on R \\ {0} to R. But since the problem statement says R→R, I'm in a dilemma. The user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem, which was incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user wants me to extract assumptions from the problem statement, even if they're not explicitly stated but necessary. For example, in the original problem, the function is defined as f(x)=1/x, so the assumption is that x ≠ 0, and c ≠ 0. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = 1/x for x ≠ 0.\n- c is a real number not equal to 0.\n\nBut the problem states \"f: R→R\", which is conflicting. Maybe the user intended to write \"f: R\\{0} → R\". Therefore, perhaps the correct assumption is that f is defined on R\\{0} → R. However, since the problem statement says R→R, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I should follow it as given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct in the sense that f is defined on R but with the understanding that at x=0, it's not considered. However, in mathematical terms, the domain must exclude 0. Since the problem mentions c ≠ 0, the continuity is only considered at points where the function is defined. So the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The function f is defined by f(x) = 1/x for all x ≠ 0.\n2. The point c is a real number with c ≠ 0.\n\nTherefore, these are the assumptions. The problem is to show that f is continuous at any such c.",
