    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this integral involving the Lambert W function. The problem is to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of W(1/x²) dx equals sqrt(2π). \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Lambert W function is. The Lambert W function, denoted as W(z), is defined as the inverse function of f(W) = W e^W. So, if y = W(z), then y e^y = z. That might be useful here. \n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity of W(1/x²) dx. Let me think if there's a substitution that can simplify this. Since the argument of the W function is 1/x², maybe substituting t = 1/x² would help. Let's try that. \n\nLet t = 1/x², which implies x = 1/√t. Then, dx/dt = - (1/(2 t^(3/2))). But since we're changing variables from x to t, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. So the limits of integration would invert. The integral becomes from t = ∞ to t = 0 of W(t) * (-dx/dt) dt. The negative sign would flip the limits back to 0 to ∞, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ W(t) * (1/(2 t^(3/2))) dt. Wait, let me check that substitution again. \n\ndx = - (1/(2 t^(3/2))) dt, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ W(t) * (1/(2 t^(3/2))) dt. Hmm, that's an integral involving W(t) times t^(-3/2). Not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe there's another substitution or integration by parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the Lambert W function in terms of an integral or a series. I remember that the Lambert W function has some integral representations or maybe can be expressed as a series expansion. Let me recall. For example, there's a series expansion around 0: W(z) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-n)^(n-1) z^n / n! , but that converges for |z| < 1/e. However, in our case, the argument of W is 1/x², which as x goes from 0 to ∞, the argument goes from ∞ to 0. So maybe for part of the integral, the series might converge, but perhaps that's complicated. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe using integration by parts. Let’s set u = W(1/x²) and dv = dx. Then du would be the derivative of W(1/x²) with respect to x, and v = x. Let me compute du. Let’s let z = 1/x², so W(z) e^{W(z)} = z. Differentiating both sides with respect to x: [W’(z) e^{W(z)} (1 + W(z))] * dz/dx = dz/dx. Since dz/dx = -2/x³. So rearranging, W’(z) = [dz/dx] / [e^{W(z)} (1 + W(z)))] * [1/(dz/dx)]? Wait, maybe this is getting messy. Let me use the chain rule. \n\nIf y = W(1/x²), then y e^y = 1/x². Differentiating both sides with respect to x: y’ e^y + y e^y y’ = -2/x³. So y’ e^y (1 + y) = -2/x³. Therefore, y’ = -2/(x³ e^y (1 + y)). But since y = W(1/x²), and e^{W(z)} = z / W(z), so e^y = (1/x²)/y. Therefore, e^y = 1/(x² y). Substituting back into y’:\n\ny’ = -2/(x³ * (1/(x² y)) * (1 + y)) ) = -2/(x³ * 1/(x² y) * (1 + y)) ) = -2/( (x³)/(x² y (1 + y)) ) = -2/( x / (y (1 + y)) ) = -2 y (1 + y)/x.\n\nTherefore, du/dx = y’ = -2 y (1 + y)/x.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Integration by parts: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. So uv evaluated from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ v du. Let's see. uv would be x W(1/x²). As x approaches ∞, 1/x² approaches 0, so W(1/x²) behaves like 1/x² (since W(z) ≈ z for small z). So x * (1/x²) = 1/x, which approaches 0. As x approaches 0, 1/x² approaches ∞, and W(1/x²) behaves like log(1/x²) - log(log(1/x²)) (since for large z, W(z) ~ log(z) - log(log(z))). So x times that would be x [log(1/x²) - log(log(1/x²))]. As x approaches 0, log(1/x²) = -2 log x, which goes to infinity, but multiplied by x, which goes to 0. So perhaps the limit is 0? So uv term might be 0. Then the integral becomes -∫ v du. So -∫ x * du. But du is -2 y (1 + y)/x dx. So the integral becomes -∫ x * (-2 y (1 + y)/x dx) = 2 ∫ y (1 + y) dx. \n\nSo we have ∫₀^∞ W(1/x²) dx = 2 ∫₀^∞ y (1 + y) dx, where y = W(1/x²). But this seems to complicate things. Maybe this isn't the right substitution. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider substituting t = W(1/x²). Let me see. Let t = W(1/x²). Then, from the definition of Lambert W, t e^t = 1/x². Therefore, x = 1/√(t e^t). Then, we can express dx in terms of dt. Let's compute dx/dt. \n\nx = (t e^t)^{-1/2}, so dx/dt = (-1/2) (t e^t)^{-3/2} (e^t + t e^t) = (-1/2) (t e^t)^{-3/2} e^t (1 + t) = (-1/2) e^{-3t/2} t^{-3/2} (1 + t) e^{-3t/2? Wait, let me recast:\n\nx = (t e^t)^{-1/2} = e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2}\n\nSo dx/dt = (-1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2} + (-1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} = - (1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} (t + 1)\n\nTherefore, dx = - (1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} (t + 1) dt\n\nBut since x goes from 0 to ∞, when x = 0, t = W(∞) which is ∞, and when x = ∞, t = W(0) which is 0. So the limits invert, and with the negative sign, the integral becomes:\n\n∫₀^∞ t dx = ∫₀^∞ t * [ (1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} (t + 1) ] dt\n\nWait, because dx is negative, so the integral becomes ∫ from t=∞ to t=0 of t * dx, which is the same as ∫ from 0 to ∞ of t * (-dx/dt) dt. So substituting:\n\n∫₀^∞ t * [ (1/2) e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} (t + 1) ] dt = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ t * e^{-t/2} t^{-3/2} (t + 1) dt\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nt * t^{-3/2} = t^{-1/2}, so:\n\n(1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2} (t + 1) dt\n\nExpand (t + 1):\n\n= (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2} t dt + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2} dt\n\n= (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t/2} t^{1/2} dt + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t/2} t^{-1/2} dt\n\nThese integrals look like gamma functions. Recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{k - 1} e^{-at} dt = a^{-k} Γ(k). \n\nFor the first integral, k = 3/2 (since t^{1/2} = t^{3/2 - 1}), a = 1/2. So Γ(3/2) = (1/2) √π, and a^{-k} = (1/2)^{-3/2} = 2^{3/2} = 2 * √2.\n\nSimilarly, the second integral: k = 1/2, a = 1/2. Γ(1/2) = √π, and a^{-k} = (1/2)^{-1/2} = √2.\n\nSo compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (1/2) * 2^{3/2} * (1/2) √π = (1/2) * (2 * √2) * (√π / 2) ) = (1/2) * √2 * √π = (√(2π))/2\n\nSecond term: (1/2) * √2 * √π = (√(2π))/2\n\nAdding both terms: (√(2π))/2 + (√(2π))/2 = √(2π)\n\nTherefore, the integral equals √(2π). That matches the given result! So this substitution worked. \n\nSo the key steps were substituting t = W(1/x²), changing variables to t, expressing x in terms of t, computing dx in terms of dt, and then evaluating the resulting integral which splits into two gamma functions. The combination of the two terms gives the desired result. \n\nTherefore, the proof involves an appropriate substitution leveraging the definition of the Lambert W function and recognizing the resulting integrals as gamma functions.",
