    "Content": "Let $p,q,r \\in (1,\\infty)$ with $1/p+1/q+1/r=1$. Prove that for every functions\n  $f \\in L^p(\\mathbb{R})$, $g \\in L^q(\\mathbb{R})$,and $h \\in L^r(\\mathbb{R})$ \n  $$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |fgh|\\leq \\|f\\|_p\\centerdot \\|g\\|_q \\centerdot\\|h\\|_r.$$ I was going to use Hölder's inequality by letting  $1/p+1/q= 1/(pq/p+q)$ and WLOG \nlet $p<q$ so that $L_q(\\mathbb{R})\\subseteq L_p(\\mathbb{R})$, but I cannot use this inclusion because $\\mathbb{R}$ does not have finite measure. Would you please help me if you have any other method to approach this problem?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The rough idea is to show a series of inequalities: $$\\int|fgh|\\leq\\|fg\\|_{p'}\\|h\\|_r\\leq\\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q\\|h\\|_r$$ where $p'=\\frac{pq}{p+q}$ or $\\frac{1}{p'}=\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}$ or $1=\\frac{1}{p/p'}+\\frac{1}{q/p'}$ . First we show that $\\|fg\\|_{p'}\\leq \\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q$ . This follows from computing $$\\|fg\\|_{p'}=\\left(\\int|fg|^{p'}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p'}}\\leq(\\|f^{p'}\\|_{p/p'}\\|g^{p'}\\|_{q/p'})^{\\frac{1}{p'}}=\\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q,$$ where the middle inequality comes from Holder's inequality. (Holder's inequality applies because $|f|\\in L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ implies $|f|^{p'}\\in L^{p/p'}(\\mathbb{R})$ , and $\\frac{p'}{p} + \\frac{p'}{q} = 1$ .) As a result, $|fg|\\in L^{p'}(\\mathbb{R})$ . Apply Holder's inequality again to get the very first inequality up above. Hope this will help you.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated information, and structure it into the specified format. The example they provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. The problem statement should then be clearly stated.\n\nLooking at the original problem on Math Stack Exchange: The title is about Hölder's inequality with three functions. The user is asking to prove that for functions f in L^p, g in L^q, h in L^r, with 1/p + 1/q + 1/r =1, the integral of |fgh| is less than or equal to the product of their norms. They mention trying Hölder with two functions and considering the inclusion of spaces but realize that doesn't work because ℝ doesn't have finite measure. They ask for another method.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that p, q, r are in (1, ∞) and satisfy 1/p + 1/q + 1/r =1. Then, the functions f, g, h are in their respective L^p, L^q, L^r spaces over ℝ. Each of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality involving the integral of |fgh| being bounded by the product of the norms.\n\nThe user mentioned trying to use Hölder with two functions and considering the inclusion of spaces but realized that ℝ's infinite measure is a problem. However, that part seems to be their attempt, which might be considered unrelated to the actual problem statement. So, according to the example, we need to filter out that part as it's the user's failed approach, not part of the problem's conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- p, q, r are in (1, ∞)\n- 1/p + 1/q + 1/r =1\n- f is in L^p(ℝ)\n- g is in L^q(ℝ)\n- h is in L^r(ℝ)\n\nThen the problem is to prove the integral inequality. The original problem statement in the question is already concise, but needs to be restructured without the user's failed attempts. So the final formatted problem should list the assumptions as above, each on a separate line, and then state the problem.",
