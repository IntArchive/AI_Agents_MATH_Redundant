    "Content": "I'm trying to prove the sum of Fibonacci numbers' reciprocals is less than 4, which is:\n$${\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1\\over F_n}} <4$$\nIt makes me confused because the only information I know about Fibonacci numbers that might be useful are its recurrence relation and general formula. But when dealing with reciprocals, I found the info hard to use. I also thought of induction: maybe turning this into:\n $${\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1\\over F_n}} <4-A$$ where A is related to $F_n$. But this method also seems to be not working. Could anyone please give me some hints?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$S={1\\over1}+{1\\over1}+{1\\over2}+{1\\over3}+{1\\over5}+{1\\over8}+\\cdots=2+{1\\over1+1}+{1\\over1+2}+{1\\over2+3}+{1\\over3+5}+\\cdots\\\\\\lt2+{1\\over1+1}+{1\\over1+1}+{1\\over2+2}+{1\\over3+3}+\\cdots\\\\\n=2+{1\\over2}\\left({1\\over1}+{1\\over1}+{1\\over2}+{1\\over3}+\\cdots \\right)=2+{1\\over2}S$$ so ${1\\over2}S\\lt2$, or $S\\lt4$. Remark:  As B. Mehta points out, this argument only works if the sum converges.  So here's a cheap way to show convergence.  By induction, if $F_n\\ge cn^2$ and $F_{n-1}\\ge c(n-1)^2$, which is true for $n\\lt4$ if $c$ is sufficiently small, then $$F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}\\ge c(n^2+(n-1)^2)=c(n^2+(n^2-2n)+1)\\ge c(n^2+2n+1)=c(n+1)^2$$ since $n^2-2n\\ge2n$ if $n\\ge4$. It follows that $\\sum{1\\over F_n}\\le{1\\over c}\\sum{1\\over n^2}$, which converges.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the key assumptions and the main problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the sum of the reciprocals of the Fibonacci numbers is less than 4. The title says \"Proving ${\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1\\over F_n}} <4$\", and the question body repeats this and mentions the user's confusion about using recurrence relations or induction. They tried induction but it didn't work, so they're asking for hints.\n\nNow, applying the example format. The example had \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". The assumptions should list each condition line by line, each applying to one object. In the example, they listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about Fibonacci numbers, so the assumptions would be related to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's see:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is typically defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 3. These are the standard assumptions unless stated otherwise. The problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on n beyond the summation from 1 to infinity, so the assumptions would be the standard definition of Fibonacci numbers. The user didn't specify any alterations to the Fibonacci sequence, so we stick with the standard recurrence.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include each part of the Fibonacci definition. Each part on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nF₁ = 1,\nF₂ = 1,\nFor n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $${\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1\\over F_n}} <4$$.\n\nI need to check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The problem is about convergence, but since it's given as a sum to infinity and asking to prove it's less than 4, the user is probably assuming the sum converges, which it does because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. However, since the problem is to prove the inequality, the assumptions are just the definition of Fibonacci numbers. The convergence is part of what needs to be established or is given. But the user's question doesn't mention convergence; they're directly asking to prove the sum is less than 4. So maybe the convergence is an implicit assumption? But according to the example, assumptions are properties or conditions applied to the objects in the problem. The Fibonacci numbers are defined by their recurrence, so that's the main assumption. The problem is to show the sum is less than 4. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the three assumptions about F₁, F₂, and the recurrence, then the problem statement.",
