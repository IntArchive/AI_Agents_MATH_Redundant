    "Content": "This was a mathematical induction question proposed in a textbook, and I've exhausted multiple approaches (proving RHS - LHS > 0, splitting the fraction, fractional exponents, etc.) The geometric mean of $n$ positive numbers $a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ is $\\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2 \\ldots a_n}$ and their arithmetic mean is $\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n}{n}$. If $a_1, a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ are $n$ positive real numbers, prove by induction that their geometric mean is always smaller than or equal to their arithmetic mean, i.e. $\\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\\ldots a_n} \\leq \\frac{a_1+a_2+\\ldots+a_n}{n}$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Using induction: Show the base case $n = 2$. Show that if the statement is true for $2^n$, then it is true for $2^{n+1}$. Show that if the statement is true for $n$, then it is true for $n - 1$. (This method of induction is sometimes called Cauchy induction ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving by induction that the geometric mean of n positive real numbers is always less than or equal to their arithmetic mean. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that we have n positive real numbers, a1, a2, ..., an. The geometric mean is the nth root of their product, and the arithmetic mean is their sum divided by n. The task is to prove the inequality using induction.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So, the assumptions here would include that each ai is a positive real number, and n is a positive integer (since induction is over n). Wait, the original problem mentions \"n positive real numbers,\" so maybe n here refers to the number of terms, which should be a positive integer.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, they say \"for n positive real numbers,\" so the induction is on the number of terms n. Therefore, n must be a positive integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each ai is a positive real number (but since there are n of them, maybe it's better to state that a1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers). But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe list each ai as a positive real number individually? But that's not practical if n is variable. Hmm, the example given had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But here, the number of terms is n, and each term is positive. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- a1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So maybe split them as:\n\n- a1 is a positive real number.\n\n- a2 is a positive real number.\n\n...\n\nBut that would be redundant. However, since the problem states \"n positive real numbers,\" maybe the correct way is to consider that all ai are positive real numbers, and n is a positive integer. Because induction is on n, so n must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- Each ai is a positive real number for i = 1, 2, ..., n.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the example structured the problem by listing \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" So perhaps here, the key assumptions are that all the numbers are positive real, and n is a positive integer. So the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote for the example:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that case, each assumption is a separate line. So here, for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- a1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the induction is on n, so n must be a positive integer. Also, each ai must be positive. So those are the two main assumptions. However, perhaps the problem doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer, but in the context of induction on n, it's implied. So maybe the problem's original statement says \"for n positive real numbers,\" but in reality, n is the number of numbers, so it's an integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each ai is a positive real number (for i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut to fit the format where each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition for one object, maybe split into:\n\n- a1 is a positive real number.\n\n- a2 is a positive real number.\n\n...\n\n- an is a positive real number.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut that's impractical because n is variable. So perhaps the correct way is to state that all ai are positive real numbers, and n is a positive integer. But how to phrase each as a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states \"n positive real numbers a1, a2, ..., an,\" the first assumption is that each ai is positive. The second assumption is that n is a positive integer (since induction is being used). However, the original problem statement may not mention n being an integer explicitly, but it's implied when talking about induction over n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that n is a positive integer because it's the number of terms, so that's given. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- Each of the numbers a1, a2, ..., an is a positive real number.\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\na1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove by induction that √[n]{a1a2...an} ≤ (a1 + a2 + ... + an)/n.\n\nAlternatively, the problem mentions \"prove by induction,\" so n is varying over positive integers. So the key assumptions are that all ai are positive and n is a positive integer.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove by induction that √[n]{a1a2...an} ≤ (a1 + a2 + ... + an)/n.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the user changed the original problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake there. Wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Because 91 is 7*13, so maybe the correct assumption is that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Or perhaps the original problem was mistranscribed. Wait, maybe the user intended to show a different problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was more general. But in any case, the example shows that assumptions can include multiple conditions on the same object (n is integer, n divisible by 7).\n\nSo for the current problem, the original problem states that a1, a2,..., an are n positive real numbers. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Each ai is a positive real number (for i from 1 to n).\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nThus, each of these is a separate assumption. However, the problem mentions \"prove by induction,\" so n is varying over positive integers, which is part of the induction process. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. For each i in {1, 2, ..., n}, ai is a positive real number.\n\n2. n is a positive integer.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is written as a separate line, each addressing one property. So here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach ai is a positive real number for i = 1, 2, ..., n,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nBut the example used separate lines for each assumption, even if they apply to the same object. In the example, two assumptions about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Similarly, here, the two assumptions are about the ai's and n. However, the ai's are multiple objects, so perhaps the first assumption is about all ai's, and the second about n.\n\nAlternatively, to split into individual assumptions for each ai, but that's not feasible since n is variable. So the correct approach is to state that all ai are positive real numbers and n is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na1, a2, ..., an are positive real numbers,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve by induction that their geometric mean is always smaller than or equal to their arithmetic mean, i.e. √[n]{a1a2...an} ≤ (a1 + a2 + ... + an)/n.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The key assumptions are that all the numbers are positive real and that n is a positive integer (since induction is on n). The problem is to prove the inequality via induction.",
