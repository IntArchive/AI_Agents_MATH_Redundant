    "Content": "Context: I know nothing about proofs and only a small amount about formal logic used in proofs. I'm trying to learn the basics of how to write a proof. For example, suppose I wanted to prove that \" all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2 \". My first reaction to this would be: \"It's self-evident, because 4 is just 2*2\". But this is obviously not a formal proof. Another attempt: \"Any integer n that is divisible by 4 must have 2*2 as part of its prime factorisation, therefore it is divisible by 2.\" But this seems to be explaining something simple by means of something more complex. It seems that you are just supposed to know that \"all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2\" and take it for granted. Or you are supposed to know, more generally, that all integers divisible by N are also divisible by P if N is divisible by P. Do you have to know this beforehand? Do mathematicians sometimes just say \"it is true because it's obvious\"?.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Great question, and well done for thinking carefully about the basics of proof and mathematics. Let's get into it! It seems that you are just supposed to know that \"all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2\" and take it for granted. This is not true! We can and must prove it. In order to prove a statement, we must know what it means. In this case, we must define \"divisible\". Definition. Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. We say that \" $a$ is divisible by $b$ \" if there exists an integer $c$ such that $a = bc$ . Now that we know what the statement means, we can prove it! Proposition. Let $a$ be an integer. If $a$ is divisible by $4$ , then $a$ is divisible by $2$ . Proof. Suppose $a$ is divisible by $4$ . This means that there is an integer $c$ such that $a = 4c$ . Equivalently, $a = 2(2c)$ . Since $c$ is an integer, $2c$ is an integer. Thus, $a$ is divisible by $2$ . $\\square$ Of course it would be annoying to reprove thousands of different statements like this for every instance of a basic divisibility fact we need to use. So, it's much better to prove general statements like the one you suggested. Can you try to prove the following more general statement? Proposition. Let $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ be integers. If $a$ is divisible by $b$ and $b$ is divisible by $c$ , then $a$ is divisible by $c$ . Proof. Fill me in! Everything in mathematics is this way. When we want to know that something is true, we must first make careful definitions to specify exactly what it is that we want to prove. Once we have those definitions in place, we can try to prove whatever we want!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then the problem is stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The question is about whether certain statements are so obvious that proving them is meaningless, using the example that all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2. The user is asking if such statements require proof or if mathematicians just accept them as obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem is about integers divisible by 4. So the assumptions here would relate to the properties of divisibility by 4 and 2. Let me list them:\n\n1. The number in question is an integer.\n2. The integer is divisible by 4.\n3. Divisibility by 4 implies the integer can be expressed as 4 times another integer.\n4. 4 is equal to 2 multiplied by 2.\n\nEach of these addresses one property or condition. Then the problem would be to prove that such an integer is also divisible by 2.\n\nWait, but the original question isn't a direct problem to solve but more of a meta-question about proofs. However, the example the user gives in their question is about proving that all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2. So perhaps the formatted problem should focus on that specific example, extracting assumptions and the problem statement from that example.\n\nSo, structuring that example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer.\n- n is divisible by 4.\n- 4 is divisible by 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is divisible by 2.\n\nBut the original question in the post is more about the nature of such proofs rather than solving that specific problem. However, according to the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem presented in the Math Stack Exchange question into the given format. The example they provided took a specific problem (proving divisibility by 91) and structured it. Here, the user's own question includes an example problem: \"all integers divisible by 4 are also divisible by 2\". So the task is to present that example in the required format.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be each individual condition leading to the conclusion. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 4,\n4 is divisible by 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is divisible by 2.\n\nBut maybe the user's example included more mathematical notation. Let me check the example again. In their example, the problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So here, similarly, for the divisibility by 4 and 2, the assumptions would be n is integer, n divisible by 4, and then the problem is to prove divisible by 2. However, the key property here is that 4 is a multiple of 2, so maybe that should be an assumption as well. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that 4 is divisible by 2. So each assumption is one line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 4,\n4 is divisible by 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that n is divisible by 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the divisibility of 4 by 2 is considered a general fact and not an assumption. But according to the example, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So in this case, the fact that 4 is divisible by 2 is a separate assumption. Hence, all the necessary conditions for the proof should be listed as assumptions. However, in standard proofs, the fact that 4 is divisible by 2 is a general mathematical truth, so maybe it's not considered an assumption here. But according to the instructions, each assumption addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So 4 being divisible by 2 is a condition applied to the number 4.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n is divisible by 4.\n- 4 is divisible by 2.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that n is divisible by 2.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of an object (n being integer, n divisible by 4, 4 divisible by 2). The problem is then to prove the conclusion based on these assumptions.",
