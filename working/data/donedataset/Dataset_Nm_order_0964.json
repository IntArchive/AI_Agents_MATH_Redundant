    "Content": "Probably a stupid question, but.. Why is the splitting field of a separable polynomial necessarily separable? Thanks. Follow up question Show that if $F$ is a splitting field over $K$ for $P \\in K[X]$, then $[F:K] \\leq n!$ I've proven this by induction on $n$, but I'm convinced there's a more algebraic approach ($n!$ screams $S_n$). If I knew $P$ were separable, then I'd know $F$ was Galois, so $ |\\mbox{Gal}(F/K)| = [F:K] $. Considering the action of $ \\mbox{Gal}(F/K) $ on the roots of $P$, we'd get an injective homomorphism into $ S_n $, giving the result. But $P$ is not given to be separable, so $P$ could have repeated roots when factorised in $F$. If $G$ is any finite group of $K$-automorphisms of $L$, then I know that $[F:K] \\leq |G| $. Considering the action of $G$ on the set of roots of $P$, say $\\Omega$, we get an injective homomorphism of $G$ into $S_{|\\Omega|}$, where $|\\Omega| \\leq n$ (I think). I have a feeling I'm wrong here, since I think $G$ is forced to be $\\mbox{Aut}(F/K)$. Any advice would be appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "New Answer [New version of the new answer. Thank you very much to KCd! --- See his comment.] The simplest, I think, is to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory (FTGT) for a normal extension $E/F$ generated by finitely many separable elements, and to obtain the fact that all the elements of $E$ are separable over $F$ as a corollary. The point is that the FTGT can be given a very short proof, which will be described below. (I of course believe that this proof is complete. Thanks for correcting me if I'm wrong.) FTGT (Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory). Let $F$ be a field, let $A$ be an algebraic closure of $F$, let $p\\in F[X]$ be a product of separable irreducible polynomials, let $E$ be a splitting field for $p$ over $F$, and let $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ be the roots of $p$ in $E$. Then the group $G$ of $F$-automorphisms of $E/F$ is finite, there is a bijective correspondence between the sub-extensions $S/F$ of $E/F$ and the subgroups $H$ of $G$, and we have\n  $$\nS\\leftrightarrow H\\iff H=\\text{Aut}_S E\\iff S=E^H\\implies[E:S]=|H|,\n$$\n  where $E^H$ is the fixed subfield of $H$, where $[E:S]$ is the degree (that is the dimension) of $E$ over $S$, and where $|H|$ is the order of $H$. We are taking for granted $(1)$ the universal property of a simple algebraic extension, and $(2)$ the existence and universal property of our splitting field $E$, which we briefly recall: $(1)$ If $a$ is algebraic over a field $K$, then the $K$-embeddings of $K(a)$ in an extension $L$ of $K$ are in natural bijection with the roots in $L$ of the minimal polynomial of $a$ over $K$. $(2)$ Any root of $p$ in any extension of $E$ is in $E$, and $E$ is generated over $F$ by the roots $a_i$ of $p$. Moreover, if $S/F$ is a sub-extension of $E/F$, then any $F$-embedding of $S$ in $E$ extends to an $F$-automorphism of $E$. Going back to the assumptions of the FTGT, we claim: $(3)$ If $S/F$ is a sub-extension of $E/F$, then $[E:S]=|\\text{Aut}_S E|$. $(4)$ If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|=[E:E^H]$. Proof that (3) and (4) imply the FTGT. Let $S/F$ be a sub-extension of $E/F$ and put $H:=\\text{Aut}_S E$. Then we have trivially $S\\subset E^H$, and $(3)$ and $(4)$ imply \n$$\n[E:S]=[E:E^H].\n$$\nConversely let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and set $\\overline H:=\\text{Aut}_{E^H}E$. Then we have trivially $H\\subset\\overline H$, and $(3)$ and $(4)$ imply $|H|=|\\overline H|$. To prove that any element $a$ of $E$ is separable over $F$, put $H:=\\text{Aut}_{F(a)}E$, and note that the set of $F$-embeddings of $F(a)$ in $E$ is in natural bijection with the set $G/H$, whose cardinality is, by the FTGT, equal to $[F(a):F]$. Proof of (3). The statement follows from the fact that any $F$-embedding of $S_i:=S(a_1,\\dots,a_i)$ in $E$ has exactly $[S_{i+1}:S_i]$ extensions to $S_{i+1}$. Proof of (4). In view of (3) it is enough to check $|H|\\ge[E:E^H]$. Let $k$ be an integer larger than $|H|$, and pick a \n$$\nb=(b_1,\\dots,b_k)\\in E^k.\n$$\nWe must show that the $b_i$ are linearly dependent over $E^H$, or equivalently that $b^\\perp\\cap(E^H)^k$ is nonzero, where $?^\\perp$ denotes the vectors orthogonal to ? in $E^k$ with respect to the dot product on $E^k$. Any element of $b^\\perp \\cap (E^H)^k$ is necessarily orthogonal to $h(b)$ for any $h \\in H$, so  $b^\\perp \\cap (E^H)^k = (Hb)^\\perp \\cap (E^H)^k$, where $Hb$ is the $H$-orbit of $H$. We will show $(Hb)^\\perp \\cap (E^H)^k$ is nonzero. Since the span of $Hb$ in $E^k$ has $E$-dimension at most $|H| < k$, $(Hb)^\\perp$ is nonzero. Choose a nonzero vector $x$ in $(Hb)^\\perp$ such that $x_i=0$ for the largest number of $i$ as possible among all nonzero vectors in $(Hb)^\\perp$. Some coordinate $x_j$ is nonzero in $E$, so by scaling we can assume $x_j = 1$ for some $j$. Since the subspace $(Hb)^\\perp$ in $E^k$ is stable under the action of $H$, for any $h$ in $H$ we have $h(x) \\in (Hb)^\\perp$, so $h(x)-x \\in (Hb)^\\perp$. Since $x_j = 1$, the $j$-th coordinate of $h(x) - x$ is $0$, so $h(x)-x = 0$ by the choice of $x$. Since this holds for all $h$ in $H$, $x$ is in $(E^H)^k$. Old Answer This is more a hint than an answer. I think the key point here is to understand the equivalence between various definitions of a separable extension . I'll just try to emphasize some of the basic facts. Let $K$ be a field, $A/K$ an algebraic closure, and $L/K$ an extension of degree $d < \\infty$ contained in $A$. We claim that the following conditions are equivalent: (1) $L/K$ is generated by separable elements, (2) each element of $L$ is separable over $K$, (3) there are exactly $d$ embeddings of $L$ in $A$ over $K$. We say that $L/K$ is separable if it satisfies these conditions. Let's sketch a proof of the equivalence. Say that the number, denoted by $[L:K]_s$, of $K$-embeddings of $L$ in $A$ is the separable degree of $L/K$. Let $M$ be a finite degree extension of $K$ contained in $A$, and $L$ a field between $K$ and $M$. We claim: (4) $[M:K]_s=[M:L]_s\\ [L:K]_s$. This is an easy, but instructive, exercise. Claim: (1) and (3) are equivalent when $K$ is generated by a single element $\\alpha$. Indeed, if $f\\in K[X]$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, then $[L:K]$ is the degree of $f$, whereas $[L:K]_s$ is the number of distinct roots of $f$ in $A$. In view of (4), the above claim implies that (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent in the general case. As a corollary, we see that a finite degree extension $L/K$ contains a largest separable sub-extension $S$, and that $[S:K]=[L:K]_s$. As a corollary to the corollary, we get the fact suggested by the notation that the integer $[L:K]_s$ does not depend on the choice of an algebraic closure of $L$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, so I need to make sure I understand both the original question and the follow-up to format them correctly according to the given example.\n\nFirst, the main question is about why the splitting field of a separable polynomial is necessarily separable. Then there's a follow-up question asking to show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n! The user mentions they used induction but think there's a more algebraic approach involving the symmetric group S_n. They also discuss Galois extensions and possible issues if P isn't separable, leading to repeated roots.\n\nI need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given lists each assumption on separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse through the follow-up question part since the original question seems to be answered, and the user is now focusing on the follow-up.\n\nThe problem to structure is: \"Show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n!\" The assumptions here would include that F is a splitting field over K for the polynomial P, and that P is in K[X]. However, in the original question, the user mentions that P is not necessarily separable, so the assumption of separability isn't given. Wait, but the title question was about a separable polynomial, but the follow-up doesn't specify that. The user is noting that if P were separable, then F would be Galois, but since it's not given, they have to handle the general case.\n\nSo, for the follow-up problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. F is a splitting field over K for a polynomial P.\n2. P is in K[X].\n3. The degree of P is n (since they mention n! which relates to the number of roots and permutations).\n4. The problem is to show [F:K] ≤ n!.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, does P have a specific degree? The user mentions n! and S_n, implying that P is of degree n. So I need to check if that's given. The user writes \"P ∈ K[X]\" but doesn't explicitly state the degree. However, since they're relating to S_n and n!, it's implied that P is of degree n. But in the problem statement, maybe the user assumes that P is of degree n. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user's follow-up question says: \"Show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n!\". So in this problem, n is the degree of P. Therefore, one assumption should be that P is a polynomial of degree n. However, in the problem statement, the user might not have explicitly stated that, but since they mention n!, it's safe to assume that P is of degree n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a splitting field over K for the polynomial P.\n- P is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated by the user is: \"Show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n!\". So the problem itself doesn't specify the degree of P as n. However, the user mentions they used induction on n, which suggests that n is the degree of P. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, we should include that P is of degree n. Otherwise, the n in n! is undefined.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that P is a polynomial of degree n. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- K is a field.\n- F is a splitting field over K for a polynomial P.\n- P is a polynomial in K[X].\n- The degree of P is n.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo here, we need to list each assumption separately. Let's see:\n\n1. K is a field.\n2. P is a polynomial in K[X].\n3. The degree of P is n.\n4. F is a splitting field over K for P.\n\nThen the problem is to show that [F:K] ≤ n!.\n\nBut in the original follow-up question, the user writes \"Show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n!\". So perhaps the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the degree of P as n. However, since n! is involved, it's implied that P is of degree n. So maybe the user assumes that n is the degree of P, and that's part of the problem's setup. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a splitting field over K for a polynomial P.\n- P is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n.\n\nBut to split them into separate lines, each addressing one property:\n\nAssumption:\n- P is a polynomial in K[X].\n- The degree of P is n.\n- F is a splitting field over K for P.\n\nBut wait, the field K is part of the problem's setup. Do we need to assume K is a field? In the example given, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The problem statement didn't mention the underlying ring or field, but since in field theory, K is a field. However, perhaps in the problem's context, we can assume K is a field without stating it, but maybe we should include it for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the problem statement, since the user mentions splitting fields, which are defined over fields, K is a field by default. So maybe it's not necessary to state it as an assumption. But to be thorough, let's check standard problem setups. Typically, when talking about splitting fields and extensions, K is assumed to be a field. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a polynomial in K[X], where K is a field.\n- The degree of P is n.\n- F is a splitting field of P over K.\n\nBut the user's example didn't mention the base ring (integers, etc.), so perhaps in this case, since splitting fields are over fields, K is a field implicitly. However, to be precise, maybe we should include K is a field as an assumption. But the example didn't mention the base structure for A(n); it just stated n is an integer. So perhaps in the problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- P is a polynomial of degree n in K[X] (with K being a field, but maybe that's assumed).\n- F is a splitting field over K for P.\n\nBut since in the example, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", which is a property of n, here, the assumptions should be:\n\n- K is a field.\n- P is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n.\n- F is a splitting field of P over K.\n\nEach on separate lines. Then the problem is to show [F:K] ≤ n!.\n\nBut looking back at the user's original follow-up question, they wrote: \"Show that if F is a splitting field over K for P ∈ K[X], then [F:K] ≤ n!\". The user might not have explicitly stated that P is of degree n, but since they refer to n! and their approach involves S_n, n must be the degree. Therefore, to make the problem well-posed, we need to include that P is of degree n. Otherwise, n is undefined.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should have assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- K is a field.\n- P is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n.\n- F is a splitting field over K for P.\n\nProblem:\nShow that [F:K] ≤ n!.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they included assumptions that applied to one object each. For instance, \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" are both about n. Here, \"K is a field\" is about K, \"P is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n\" is about P, and \"F is a splitting field over K for P\" is about F. So each line addresses a different object. That fits the example's structure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nK is a field,\nP is a polynomial in K[X] of degree n,\nF is a splitting field over K for P.\nProblem:\nShow that $[F:K] \\leq n!$.",
