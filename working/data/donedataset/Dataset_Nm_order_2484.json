    "AcceptedAnswer": "We first prove the following lemma. Lemma. Let $\\lambda>0$ . Then $$\\sup_{x>0}\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+x}}+\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{\\lambda}x}}\\right)=\\begin{cases}\\frac2{\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt\\lambda}}&\\text{if }\\lambda<4\\\\\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda-1}}&\\text{if }\\lambda\\geq 4.\\end{cases}$$ Proof. Fixing $\\lambda$ constant, let the left side be $f(x)$ . The function $f$ is clearly continuous and infinitely differentiable, and so its global extrema are reached when $x\\to 0$ , $x\\to\\infty$ , or when $f''(x)=0$ . It is not hard to compute that $$f''(x)=0\\Longleftrightarrow \\lambda^2(1+x)^3=x(\\lambda+x)^3;$$ the polynomial on the right factors as $(x^2-\\lambda)(x^2-(\\lambda^2-3\\lambda)x+\\lambda)$ . So, the extrema are when $x=\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ , or when $x$ and $\\lambda/x$ satisfy $x+\\frac\\lambda x=\\lambda^2-3\\lambda$ . For $\\lambda<4$ , $x+\\frac\\lambda x$ is always larger than $\\lambda^2-3\\lambda$ , so the only $x$ with $f''(x)=0$ is $x=\\sqrt\\lambda$ , giving the desired bound. For $\\lambda\\geq 4$ , such a real $x>0$ does exist, and satisfies, letting $y=\\lambda/x$ so that $x+y=\\lambda^2-3\\lambda$ , \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+x}}\\right)\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+y}}\\right)&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+(\\lambda^2-3\\lambda)+\\lambda}}=\\frac1{\\lambda-1}\\\\\n\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+x}}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+y}}\\right)^2&=\\frac{2+x+y}{(1+x)(1+y)}=\\frac{\\lambda-2}{\\lambda-1},\n\\end{align*} so $$\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+x}}+\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+y}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda-2}{\\lambda-1}+\\frac2{\\lambda-1}}=\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda-1}.$$ For $\\lambda\\geq 4$ , this is always at least the value $\\frac2{\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt\\lambda}}$ achieved at $x=\\sqrt\\lambda$ , and so is the maximum of $f$ . $\\square$ Now, under the substitution $w=\\frac{b^2}{a^2}$ , $x=\\frac{c^2}{b^2}$ , $y=\\frac{d^2}{c^2}$ , $z=\\frac{a^2}{d^2}$ , the problem becomes to show $$\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+w}}+\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+x}}+\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+y}}+\\frac1{\\sqrt{1+z}}\\leq 3$$ for $w,x,y,z>0$ and $wxyz=1$ . If $wx,yz\\leq 4$ , then the sum is at most $$\\frac2{\\sqrt{1+t}}+\\frac2{\\sqrt{1+\\frac1t}}\\leq \\frac4{\\sqrt{2}}=2\\sqrt2<3$$ for $t=\\sqrt{wx}$ , where we have used our lemma on $\\lambda=t^2=wx$ , $\\lambda=1/t^2=yz$ , and again on $\\lambda=1$ . Otherwise, assume without loss of generality that $wx\\geq 4$ , and let $s=\\sqrt{wx}$ . Then, by our lemma, the sum is at most $$\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{s^2-1}}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac1s}},$$ where $s\\geq 2$ . However, for $s\\geq 2$ , \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{s^2-1}}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac1s}}\n&=\\frac{\\sqrt s(\\sqrt s+2\\sqrt{s-1})}{\\sqrt{s^2-1}}\\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{\\sqrt s\\left(\\sqrt s+2\\left[\\sqrt s-\\frac1{2\\sqrt s}\\right]\\right)}{\\sqrt{s^2-1}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3s-1}{\\sqrt{s^2-1}},\n\\end{align*} which is at most $3$ whenever $s\\geq 5/3$ since $$(3s-1)^2=9s^2-6s+1\\leq 9s^2-9\\implies \\frac{3s-1}{\\sqrt{s^2-1}}\\leq 3.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with assumptions and the problem statement. The original question is about proving an inequality involving four positive real numbers a, b, c, d. The expression given is a sum of four fractions, each involving two variables in a square root denominator. The user mentioned an equality case where the left-hand side (LHS) approaches 3 as a variable x tends to infinity, using a specific substitution for a, b, c, d. They also mentioned that traditional methods like Cauchy-Schwarz might not work here.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that a, b, c, d are positive reals. So each of these variables is a positive real number. The problem is to prove that the sum of those four terms is less than or equal to 3. The example provided in the user's instruction had each assumption on a separate line, addressing one property per object. So for this problem, each variable (a, b, c, d) being a positive real should be listed individually. That means four separate assumptions. Then the problem statement is the inequality itself.\n\nWait, but in the example given, sometimes assumptions are combined if they refer to the same property applied to multiple objects. For instance, in the original example, the user had \"n is an integer\" as one assumption, but didn't list each variable separately if they all share the same condition. Wait, no, in the example, it was just about n. But in this problem, we have four variables a, b, c, d each being positive reals. The example the user gave had two assumptions for n: being an integer and being divisible by 7. But here, each variable has the same condition: positive real. So maybe it's better to list each variable with that condition separately, but perhaps the user's example might group them. Wait, looking at the example again, the user wrote for the original problem: \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is one condition per line. So if there are four variables each with the same condition, maybe each is listed. But maybe the user would prefer to list all variables in one line if they share the same condition. Hmm, the example didn't have that case. Let me check the original example again. The original example had \"n is an integer\" as one assumption. So in that case, if multiple variables share the same condition, perhaps they can be listed in one line. For instance, \"a, b, c, d are positive reals\" as one assumption. But wait, the user's instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So \"one object\" here could be each variable. So perhaps each variable must be listed separately. But in the example, the user had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", both applying to n. So maybe each line is one condition per object. Therefore, for each variable (a, b, c, d), we have a separate assumption that each is a positive real. So four separate lines: a is a positive real, b is a positive real, etc.\n\nBut maybe the user's intention is to group them. Let me check. The problem states \"if a,b,c,d are positive reals we have...\". So the condition is that all four variables are positive reals. But according to the example's formatting, each assumption is a separate line, each applying to one object. So if the example had multiple variables with the same condition, would they be listed one by one? Since the example only had n, which was an integer and divisible by 7. So in this case, since all four variables have the same condition (positive real), perhaps each is listed individually. Alternatively, maybe the user's format requires that each assumption line can mention multiple objects if they share the same property, but each line addresses one property. For example, \"a, b, c, d are positive reals\" as one line. Because the problem states \"if a,b,c,d are positive reals\", which is a single condition applied to all four variables. So maybe it's better to list them all in one line as a single assumption. However, the user's instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Wait, \"one object\". So if the variables are four different objects, each with the same property, then perhaps four separate lines. But that might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe \"one property\" per line, even if applied to multiple objects. For instance, \"a, b, c, d are positive real numbers\" as one assumption line. Because the property is \"being a positive real\", applied to each of the four variables. The instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Wait, maybe \"applied to one object\" means that each line can mention one object and one property. So if multiple objects share the same property, they can be grouped. Hmm, the example given by the user had \"n is an integer\" as one line, so that's one object, one property. If there are multiple objects with the same property, maybe each object is listed in separate lines. But that would lead to four lines for a, b, c, d each being positive reals. Alternatively, maybe the instruction allows grouping if they share the same property. The example didn't have that case, so perhaps it's safer to list each variable separately. But that might be excessive. Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"if a,b,c,d are positive reals\". So the condition is that all four variables are positive reals. Therefore, as a single assumption: a, b, c, d are positive reals. But according to the user's example, each assumption line applies to one object. So perhaps the user expects each variable to be listed. But maybe not. Let me think. The user's example had two assumptions for n: being integer and divisible by 7. So each line was a different condition on the same object. Here, the four variables each have the same condition. So perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"a, b, c, d are positive real numbers\" as one line. Because it's one condition applied to multiple objects. The user's instruction says \"each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". Wait, maybe \"applied to one object\" means each line can have multiple objects as long as the same property applies to them. For example, \"a, b, c, d are positive reals\" is one property applied to four objects. So that's acceptable as one line. Because the example didn't have multiple objects, but if they did, this would make sense. Otherwise, listing four separate lines would be redundant. So I'll go with one line: \"a, b, c, d are positive real numbers\".\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c, d are positive real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}+\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{b^2+c^2}}+\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{c^2+d^2}}+\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{d^2+a^2}}\\leq3.$$\n\nWait, but the original problem has the variables in a cyclic manner: a with b, b with c, c with d, d with a. The problem is to show the sum is ≤3. The user in their question mentions an equality case where a=x^4, b=x^3, c=x^2, d=x as x→∞, leading LHS to approach 3. So the problem doesn't have additional hidden assumptions beyond the variables being positive reals. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption as the variables being positive reals, and the problem is to prove the inequality.",
