    "Content": "I have seen many proofs about a prime element is irreducible, but up to now I am thinking whether this result is true for any ring. Recently, I got this proof: Suppose that $a$ is prime, and that $a = bc$. Then certainly $a\\mid bc$, so by definition of prime, $a\\mid b$ or $a\\mid c$, say $a \\mid b$.\nIf $b = ad$ then $b = bcd$, so $cd = 1$ and therefore $c$ is a unit. (Note that $b$ cannot be $0$,for\nif so, $a = bc = 0$, which is not possible since $a$ is prime.) Similarly, if $a\\mid c$ with $c = ad$ then $c = bcd$,  so $bd = 1$ and $b$ is a unit. Therefore $a$ is irreducible. I think with the above proof we do not need the ring to be an integral domain. If this is the case then I will stop doubting, else, I am still in it. Can somebody help me out?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Notice that your proof assumes that $\\rm\\: b\\ne 0\\ \\Rightarrow\\ b\\:$ is cancellable, so it fails if $\\rm\\:b\\:$ is a zero-divisor. Factorization theory is more complicated in non-domains. Basic notions such as associate and irreducible bifurcate into a few inequivalent notions. See for example When are Associates Unit Multiples?

However, in **arbitrary rings** (with zero divisors), a prime element may **not** be irreducible. For example, in the ring $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, the element $(2, 0)$ is prime but reducible: $(2, 0) = (2, 0) \\cdot (1, 0)$, where neither factor is a unit. The original proof fails because it implicitly assumes cancellation (valid only in domains). Thus, the property \"prime implies irreducible\" depends on the ring having no zero divisors.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether any prime element in a ring is necessarily irreducible, and they provided a proof that seems not to rely on the ring being an integral domain. But they're still unsure, so I need to verify if the proof holds in general or if there are hidden assumptions.\n\nFirst, I recall that in an integral domain, prime elements are indeed irreducible. But the user is questioning whether this holds in any ring, not just integral domains. Let me break down the given proof step by step.\n\nThe proof starts by assuming a is prime and a = bc. Then, since a divides bc, by primality, a divides b or a divides c. Let's say a divides b, so b = ad. Substituting back, a = bc = a d c. Then, cancelling a from both sides (assuming a is not a zero divisor?), we get 1 = d c, so c is a unit. Similarly, if a divides c, then b would be a unit. Therefore, a is irreducible.\n\nWait, but cancellation in rings isn't always possible unless we're in a domain or if a is not a zero divisor. In a general ring, if a is a zero divisor, you can't just cancel it. For example, if a has a non-trivial annihilator, then a*d*c = a*1 might not imply d*c = 1. So the step where they cancel a might be problematic.\n\nThe user's proof mentions that a cannot be zero because it's prime. In rings, prime elements are by definition non-zero, so that part is okay. But even if a is non-zero, in a ring with zero divisors, cancellation might fail. For instance, consider a ring like Z/6Z. Let's take a prime element there. Wait, but in Z/6Z, the primes are different. Wait, actually in Z/6Z, the concept of prime elements might not behave the same as in integral domains. For example, 2 is a prime element in Z/6Z? Let me check. \n\nIn Z/6Z, the elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5. A prime element p should satisfy that if p divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Let's test 2. Suppose 2 divides ab in Z/6Z. If ab ≡ 0 mod 6 and 2 divides ab, which in Z/6Z, 2 divides ab if ab ≡ 0 or 2 or 4 mod 6. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe Z/6Z isn't a good example because it's not an integral domain. But perhaps in such rings, primes can be reducible? \n\nAlternatively, take the ring of 2x2 matrices. But matrix rings aren't commutative, so maybe that's a different story. Let's think of a commutative ring with zero divisors. Suppose R = Z[x]/(x^2), which has zero divisors because x^2 = 0. Let's consider an element like x. Is x prime? If x divides ab, does it divide a or b? Suppose a and b are elements of R. If ab is divisible by x, that means ab has a term with x. But in R, elements are of the form a + bx, so their product is (a + bx)(c + dx) = ac + (ad + bc)x. If this is divisible by x, then ac must be 0. But since R is Z[x]/(x^2), coefficients are integers? Wait, actually, R would be Z[x]/(x^2), so elements are polynomials with integer coefficients modulo x^2. So elements are a + bx where a, b are integers. Then, multiplication is (a + bx)(c + dx) = ac + (ad + bc)x. Now, if x divides this product, then the constant term ac must be 0. So ac = 0 in Z. Therefore, either a = 0 or c = 0. If a = 0, then the first element is bx, so x divides it. Similarly, if c = 0, then the second element is dx, so x divides it. Therefore, x is prime in this ring. But is x irreducible? \n\nIn this ring, to check if x is irreducible, suppose x = bc. Then b and c are elements of R, so b = m + nx and c = p + qx. Then bc = (mp) + (mq + np)x. Setting this equal to x, we have mp = 0 and mq + np = 1. Since mp = 0 in integers, either m=0 or p=0. If m=0, then b = nx, and then mq + np = 0*q + np = np =1. So p must be 1/n, but n and p are integers. So n must divide 1, so n=1 or -1. Thus, p=1 or -1. Therefore, c = ±1 + qx. But in this case, c is a unit because the constant term is ±1, and in R, units are elements with constant term ±1. Similarly, if p=0, then c = qx, and we have mq =1, so m=1/q which again requires q=±1, but m must be integer. Wait, this seems like x can be written as a product of a non-unit and a unit? Wait, no. If m=0 and p=1, then b = nx where n=1, so b = x, and c = 1 + qx. Then x * (1 + qx) = x + qx^2 = x, since x^2=0. So c is a unit because 1 + qx has inverse 1 - qx. Therefore, in this factorization, one of the factors is a unit. Hence, x is irreducible. \n\nBut wait, in this ring, x is prime and irreducible. But maybe there's another example. Let's consider a different ring. Take R = Z/12Z. Let's consider the element 6 in Z/12Z. Wait, 6 is not prime because 6 divides 6*6=36 ≡ 0 mod 12, but 6 doesn't divide 6 unless 6*2=12 ≡0 mod 12, but 6 divides 0, but 6 isn't prime. Maybe another element. Let's take 2 in Z/12Z. Is 2 prime? Suppose 2 divides ab in Z/12Z. Then ab ≡ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 mod 12. If 2 divides ab, then ab must be even. But 2 divides ab implies 2 divides a or 2 divides b? Not necessarily. For example, take a=3 and b=2. Then ab=6, which is divisible by 2, but 2 doesn't divide 3. So 2 is not prime in Z/12Z. Hmm. Maybe 5 in Z/12Z. Let's see. If 5 divides ab, then ab ≡ 5 or 10 mod 12. Suppose ab ≡5 mod 12. Then possible a and b such that ab=5 mod12. For example, a=5 and b=1, or a=7 and b=11. Similarly, if ab≡10 mod12, then 5 divides ab. But does 5 divide a or 5 divide b? Let's test. If ab ≡5 mod12, then maybe a=5 and b=1, then 5 divides a. If a=7 and b=11, ab=77≡5 mod12. But 5 doesn't divide 7 or 11 in Z/12Z. So 5 is not prime. So maybe in Z/12Z, there are no prime elements? Or perhaps I need to check another element.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ring Z × Z. This ring has zero divisors, like (1,0) and (0,1). Let's take an element like (2,2). Suppose (2,2) is prime. If (2,2) divides (a,b)(c,d) = (ac, bd), then (2,2) divides each component. So if (2,2) divides (ac, bd), then 2 divides ac and 2 divides bd. But being prime in each component doesn't necessarily make it prime overall. This might not be the best example.\n\nAlternatively, consider a ring where there are idempotent elements. For example, in the ring Z/6Z, the element 3 is idempotent (3*3=9≡3 mod6). Is 3 prime? If 3 divides ab, then ab ≡0 or 3 mod6. Suppose ab≡3 mod6. Then a and b must be odd. For example, a=3 and b=1, so 3 divides a. But if a=1 and b=3, then 3 divides b. But if a=3 and b=3, then 3 divides a and b. However, what if a=5 and b=3? 5*3=15≡3 mod6. 3 divides ab=3, but 3 divides a=5? No, 5 mod6 is not divisible by 3. Similarly, 3 doesn't divide 5. So 3 divides ab but doesn't divide a or b, so 3 is not prime. So perhaps in rings with zero divisors, prime elements are harder to find.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the ring of polynomials over a field with zero divisors, but that's not straightforward. Wait, actually in the ring K[x]/(x^2), where K is a field, this ring has zero divisors. Let's take the element x. Is x prime? If x divides ab, then in K[x]/(x^2), ab must be a multiple of x. But elements are of the form a + bx, so their product is a c + (a d + b c) x. If x divides this, then a c =0. Since K is a field, either a=0 or c=0. If a=0, then the first element is bx, so x divides it. Similarly, if c=0, the second element is dx, so x divides it. Hence, x is prime. Now, is x irreducible? Suppose x = f g. Then f and g are elements of K[x]/(x^2), so f = a + b x, g = c + d x. Then f g = a c + (a d + b c) x. Setting equal to x, we get a c =0 and a d + b c =1. Since a c =0 in a field, either a=0 or c=0. Suppose a=0. Then f = b x, and the equations become 0*c =0 and 0*d + b c =1. Since a=0, we have b c =1. Since K is a field, b and c are invertible. Hence, f = b x and g = c + d x, with c = b^{-1}. Then g = b^{-1} + d x. Is g a unit? In K[x]/(x^2), the units are elements with non-zero constant term, because (a + b x)(c + d x) = a c + (a d + b c) x. To get 1, need a c =1 and a d + b c =0. So if a ≠0, then c = a^{-1}, and d = - b a^{-2}. Hence, any element with a ≠0 is a unit. Therefore, g = b^{-1} + d x has a non-zero constant term, so it's a unit. Similarly, if c=0 in the original assumption, then g = d x, and we would have a d =1, so a = d^{-1}, making f = a + b x a unit. Thus, x can only be factored as a product of a non-unit (b x) and a unit (g). Wait, but in this case, f = b x is a non-unit (since its constant term is zero), but the other factor g is a unit. Therefore, the factorization x = f g has one non-unit and one unit. However, the definition of irreducible is that if a = bc, then either b or c is a unit. But here, one is a unit and the other isn't. Wait, so in this case, x is irreducible? Wait, no, the definition is that an element is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two non-units. So if every factorization into two elements must have at least one unit, then it's irreducible. In this case, x = (b x)(g), where g is a unit. So one of the factors is a unit, hence x is irreducible. So here, x is both prime and irreducible in K[x]/(x^2).\n\nBut this example doesn't show a prime element that is reducible. So perhaps the original proof is correct, and in any ring, prime elements are irreducible? But I thought that was only true in integral domains. Wait, maybe the confusion comes from different definitions. Let me check the standard definitions.\n\nIn a commutative ring R, an element p is prime if (p) is a prime ideal. This means that if p divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b. An element a is irreducible if a = bc implies that either b or c is a unit. \n\nThe standard proof in integral domains that prime implies irreducible uses cancellation: if a = bc, then a divides bc, so a divides b or a divides c. If a divides b, then b = a d, so a = a d c. In an integral domain, we can cancel a (since a ≠0), giving 1 = d c, so c is a unit. But in a general ring, cancellation isn't possible unless a is not a zero divisor. So in a ring where a is a zero divisor, you can't cancel. For example, suppose R is a ring where a ≠0 but a d =0 for some d ≠0. Then if a = a d c, you can't conclude that d c =1.\n\nBut wait, in the user's proof, they mention that if a is prime, then a ≠0 (since prime elements are non-zero by definition). But even if a is non-zero, if a is a zero divisor (i.e., there exists non-zero d with a d =0), then cancellation fails. Therefore, in such a case, the step where they cancel a from a = a d c to get 1 = d c would not be valid, because a d c = a implies a (d c -1) =0. If a is a zero divisor, then even though a is non-zero, we can't conclude that d c -1 =0; there might be d c -1 in the annihilator of a.\n\nTherefore, the user's proof relies on the ability to cancel a, which requires that a is not a zero divisor. In an integral domain, all non-zero elements are not zero divisors, so the proof works. But in a general ring, a prime element might be a zero divisor, so cancellation is not possible, making the proof invalid.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that in a ring where prime elements are not zero divisors, the proof holds, but in rings with zero divisors, a prime element could potentially be reducible. However, the user's proof assumes cancellation, which might not hold. Thus, the statement \"every prime element is irreducible\" is only necessarily true in rings without zero divisors, i.e., integral domains.\n\nBut wait, in the example I considered earlier with R = K[x]/(x^2), the element x is prime and irreducible. So maybe in some rings with zero divisors, prime elements are still irreducible. But is there an example where a prime element is reducible?\n\nLet me construct such an example. Take the ring R = Z × Z. This ring has zero divisors, e.g., (1,0)(0,1) = (0,0). Let's consider the element (2,1). Is (2,1) prime? Suppose (2,1) divides (a,b)(c,d) = (ac, bd). Then (2,1) divides (ac, bd), which means 2 divides ac and 1 divides bd. Since 1 divides bd is always true, the condition reduces to 2 divides ac. For (2,1) to be prime, this should imply that (2,1) divides (a,b) or (c,d). That is, either 2 divides a and 1 divides b, or 2 divides c and 1 divides d. \n\nBut suppose we take (a,b) = (1,2) and (c,d) = (3,1). Then (ac, bd) = (3,2). (2,1) divides (3,2) only if 2 divides 3 (which it doesn't) and 1 divides 2 (which it does). But since 2 doesn't divide 3, (2,1) doesn't divide (3,2). However, (2,1) was supposed to divide (ac, bd) = (3,2). Wait, but (2,1) divides (3,2) only if 2 divides 3 and 1 divides 2. Since 2 doesn't divide 3, it doesn't. Hence, (2,1) is not prime. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, consider the element (2,0) in Z × Z. Is (2,0) prime? If (2,0) divides (a,b)(c,d) = (ac, bd), then 2 divides ac and 0 divides bd. But 0 divides bd is always true. So (2,0) divides any product where ac is even. For (2,0) to be prime, this must imply (2,0) divides (a,b) or (c,d). But (2,0) divides (a,b) if 2 divides a and 0 divides b. But 0 divides b is always true. So (2,0) divides (a,b) iff 2 divides a. Similarly for (c,d). So if ac is even, then either a is even or c is even. Therefore, (2,0) would be prime. But is (2,0) irreducible? Suppose (2,0) = (a,b)(c,d) = (ac, bd). Then we need ac=2 and bd=0. Since we're in Z × Z, possible factorizations of 2 are (2,0) = (1,0)(2,0) or (2,0)(1,0), or (factors of 2 in Z) crossed with factors in Z. For example, (2,0) = (2,0)(1,0). Here, (2,0) is written as a product of (2,0) and (1,0). But (2,0) is not a unit (units in Z × Z are (1,1), (1,-1), etc.), and (1,0) is not a unit either. Hence, (2,0) is reducible. However, is (2,0) prime? From earlier, if (2,0) divides (ac, bd), then 2 divides ac, so either 2 divides a or 2 divides c. Therefore, (2,0) divides (a,b) or (c,d). Hence, (2,0) is prime. But we just saw that (2,0) = (2,0)(1,0), a product of two non-units. Hence, (2,0) is prime but reducible. This provides a counterexample where a prime element is reducible in a ring with zero divisors.\n\nTherefore, the original proof given by the user is flawed because it assumes cancellation, which requires the ring to have no zero divisors. In a ring with zero divisors, a prime element can be reducible. Hence, the statement that a prime element is irreducible holds in integral domains but not necessarily in arbitrary rings.",
