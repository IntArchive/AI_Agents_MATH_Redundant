    "Content": "I'm well aware of the combinatorial variant of the proof, i.e. noting that each formula is a different representation for the number of subsets of a set of $n$ elements. I'm curious if there's a series of algebraic manipulations that can lead from $\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i}$ to $2^n$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's one.  Let $g(n) = \\sum \\limits_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i}$.  Then $$g(n+1) - g(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{i} - \\sum_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \\left(\\binom{n+1}{i} - \\binom{n}{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \\binom{n}{i-1} $$\n$$= \\sum_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i} = g(n).$$\nHere, we use the fact that $\\binom{n}{n+1} = \\binom{n}{-1} = 0$, as well as the binomial recurrence $\\binom{n+1}{i} = \\binom{n}{i} + \\binom{n}{i-1}$. Thus we have $g(n+1) = 2g(n)$, with $g(0) = 1$.  Since $g(n)$ doubles each time $n$ is incremented by 1, we must have \n$$g(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i} = 2^n.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants an algebraic proof that the sum of binomial coefficients from i=0 to n equals 2^n. They already know the combinatorial proof involving subsets, so I need to focus on algebraic manipulations.\n\nFirst, I recall that the binomial theorem states that (a + b)^n = sum from k=0 to n of C(n,k) a^(n-k) b^k. If I set a = 1 and b = 1, then (1 + 1)^n = 2^n, which is the right-hand side of the equation. The left-hand side becomes the sum of C(n,k) * 1^(n-k) * 1^k, which simplifies to the sum of C(n,k). So, substituting a and b as 1 gives the result directly. But wait, is that considered an algebraic manipulation? The user might be looking for something that starts with the sum and transforms it step by step into 2^n without invoking the binomial theorem directly. Maybe expand the binomial theorem and then substitute specific values?\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Base case n=0: sum is C(0,0)=1, and 2^0=1, which works. Assume true for n=k, then for n=k+1, use the recursive formula C(k+1,i) = C(k,i-1) + C(k,i). Split the sum into two parts, apply the inductive hypothesis, and show it sums to 2*2^k = 2^(k+1). But induction is a different method; the question specifies algebraic manipulations, so maybe that's not what they want.\n\nAnother approach: use generating functions. The generating function for binomial coefficients is (1 + x)^n. Evaluating at x=1 gives sum C(n,i) * 1^i = (1 + 1)^n = 2^n. But again, this is similar to the binomial theorem approach. Maybe the user wants a more step-by-step algebraic proof without referencing the binomial theorem explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding the sum and manipulating terms. For example, note that each term C(n,i) counts the number of subsets, but that's combinatorial. Maybe use Pascal's identity and rearrange terms. Start with sum_{i=0}^n C(n,i) = sum_{i=0}^n [C(n-1,i-1) + C(n-1,i)] if using Pascal's identity. Then split the sum into two parts, adjust indices, and show that each part sums to 2^{n-1}, leading to total 2*2^{n-1}=2^n. But this is essentially an inductive step, which again might be considered a different method.\n\nWait, the problem statement in the example didn't have any assumptions, but the user's example included assumptions. However, the current problem doesn't have any specific conditions on n except that it's a non-negative integer (since binomial coefficients are defined for i from 0 to n). So the assumptions would be that n is a non-negative integer, and the problem is to algebraically show the sum equals 2^n.\n\nBut in the original example provided by the user, the assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" However, in this case, the problem is general for all n. Wait, the example given by the user had an incorrect assumption. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" so that assumption was incorrect. So perhaps the user's example had an error. But the current problem here is about the sum of binomial coefficients, which holds for all non-negative integers n. So in the formatted problem, the assumption should be \"n is a non-negative integer,\" right?\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Algebraic Proof that sum_{i=0}^n binom{n}{i} = 2^n\" and the question is asking for algebraic manipulations. So the assumptions would just be that n is a non-negative integer. The problem is to prove the sum equals 2^n using algebraic methods. So the formatted version should have Assumption: n is a non-negative integer, and the problem as stated.\n\nBut the example given by the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n.\" So maybe the user's example was incorrect. But regardless, when structuring the current problem, I need to list the correct assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions here are that n is a non-negative integer. Because binomial coefficients are defined for non-negative integers n and i ranging from 0 to n. So in the assumption section, it's just one line: n is a non-negative integer. Then the problem is to prove the sum equals 2^n algebraically.",
