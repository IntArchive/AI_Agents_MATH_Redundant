    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to evaluate the integral from 0 to π/2 of arccot(a sin x + sqrt(a² -1)) dx, and they've provided an expression involving inverse sine and inverse hyperbolic sine squared. The answer should be structured with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The integral is given with specific limits and an integrand involving arccotangent of a function of a and sin x. The user mentions that a ≥ 1, so that's an important assumption because sqrt(a² -1) needs to be real. Without that condition, the square root would become imaginary, which might complicate things.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition or property applied to one object. Here, the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. The variable of integration is x, which ranges from 0 to π/2.\n2. The parameter a is greater than or equal to 1. This ensures that sqrt(a² -1) is real and non-negative, so the expression inside arccot is real.\n3. The integrand function is arccot(a sin x + sqrt(a² -1)), which is well-defined since the argument inside arccot is real.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, do they need to mention that the integrand is arccot of that expression? The example given had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, maybe the main assumptions are about a and the domain of x. The problem is to evaluate the integral, so the assumptions are the conditions under which this integral holds, which is a ≥1. Also, x is integrated from 0 to π/2, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions are only about a being ≥1. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption was n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added that? Wait no, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted assumption lists n as integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was modified. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem under assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem is to assume n is divisible by both 7 and 13? But the example shows n is an integer and divisible by 7. That seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect. Anyway, the user's instruction says to list all assumptions, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to π/2, but that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The key assumption here is a ≥1. So perhaps the assumption is that a is a real number greater than or equal to 1. Also, maybe the integrand is well-defined, but that's inherent given a ≥1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption that a is greater than or equal to 1. The problem is to evaluate the integral as given, resulting in the expression with inverse sine and inverse hyperbolic sine squared.\n\nBut the original problem also includes their attempt, which we should ignore. So the task is to filter out the unnecessary parts (like the user's attempt) and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\na ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nEvaluate the integral\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cot^{-1} \\left(a\\sin x+\\sqrt{a^2-1}\\right) \\, dx\n\\]\nand show that it equals\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sin^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sinh^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote the integral result as equal to that sum. So the problem is to evaluate the integral and prove it equals that expression. But maybe the problem is just to evaluate the integral, and the right-hand side is the answer. So the problem statement could be \"Evaluate the integral [...] for a ≥1.\" Or \"Prove that the integral equals [...] for a ≥1.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement starts with \"Prove that [...]\". In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem has \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo in this case, the problem is to evaluate or prove the integral equals that expression. The user's question is \"How to evaluate or prove this integral: [...]\". So the problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's equal to that expression.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions: a is a real number, a ≥1. The problem is to evaluate the integral and show it equals that sum.\n\nBut in the original problem, the integral is already written with the equals sign, so the problem is to prove the equality. So the problem is \"Prove that [...] equals [...] for a ≥1.\"\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a real number,\na ≥ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cot^{-1} \\left(a\\sin x + \\sqrt{a^2 - 1}\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sin^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sinh^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct. Each assumption is on its own line, addressing one condition. The problem is stated clearly. The user's attempt and other details from the Math Stack Exchange question are filtered out, as per instructions.",
