    "Content": "Let $(X,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ be a normed linear space and $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ be $n$ linearly independent vectors in $X$. Show that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that if $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{n} \\in X$ with $\\|y_{i}\\| < \\epsilon$, $i = 1,2,\\ldots,n$, then $x_{1} + y_{1}, x_{2} + y_{2},\\ldots,x_{n} + y_{n}$ are also linearly independent vectors in $X$. I've been thinking over this for a few days and I'm not really getting anywhere. I've tried to start with the definition of linear independence for the $x$-vectors and then working towards the linear independence of $x+y$ given the condition on $y$, but I'm not getting anywhere. May someone offer a hint or a solution?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT: What I've written below the line is not correct. One cannot conclude that $\\|T\\|_\\text{op} \\leq n \\varepsilon$, because the preceding only holds for one particular nonzero $a \\in \\mathbb F^n$ provided by dependence, not all nonzero $a \\in \\mathbb F^n$. It's bothering me that there are no correct proofs now, so here I'll give the proof that Daniel Fischer described in the hopes that, after seeing it, you don't think it's so bad. Feel free to comment otherwise, though! Let $\\mathbb F$ be the field over which the vector space $X$ is defined. To each $n$-tuple $\\mathbf v = (v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ of vectors $v_i \\in X$, define the map $T_{\\mathbf v} : \\mathbb F^n \\longrightarrow X$ given by\n$$\n\\mathbb F^n \\ni a = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\longmapsto \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i v_i \\in X.\n$$\n$T_{\\mathbf v}$ is a bounded linear map (this is easy to check), and hence it's continuous as a map  between metric spaces. If we let $S = \\left\\{ a \\in \\mathbb F^n : \\|a\\| = 1 \\right\\}$ be the unit sphere in $\\mathbb F^n$, observe that \n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf v \\text{ is linearly independent } &\\iff T_{\\mathbf v}(S) \\text{ is disjoint from } 0 \\in X.\n\\end{align*}\n(This follows directly from the definition of linear independence.) Since $S$ is compact and $T_{\\mathbf v}$ is continuous, the set $T_{\\mathbf v}(S)$ is compact , and therefore closed, in $X$. Since $X$ is a metric space, it's regular as a topological space. (A quick way to see this is metric $\\implies$ normal $\\implies$ regular.) By linear independence, the closed set $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$ is disjoint from $0$, and by regularity it has a neighborhood $U$ disjoint from $0$. We'll show that $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ is contained in the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$; from compactness of $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$, it follows that taking $\\varepsilon$ sufficiently small puts $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S) \\subseteq U$. In particular, $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ is disjoint from $0$, and hence $\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y$ is a linearly independent list. To see that $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ is contained in the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$, consider a general point $p = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i (x_i + y_i)$ of $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ (so $\\|a\\| = 1$). Then $q = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i$ is in $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$, and\n$$\nd(p, q) = \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i (x_i + y_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i \\right\\| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| a_i \\right| \\left\\| y_i \\right\\| < \\varepsilon \\|a\\| = \\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhere we've arbitrarily assigned $\\mathbb F^n$ the $1$-norm $\\|a\\| = \\sum_{i=1}^n |a_i|$, which is fine since all norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are topologically equivalent. Hence every point $p \\in T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ is within distance $\\varepsilon$ from some point $q$ of $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$, establishing that $T_{\\mathbf x + \\mathbf y}(S)$ lies in the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of $T_{\\mathbf x}(S)$. At the risk of stealing Sheldon Axler's thunder, here's a solution without determinants. It also avoids the problem that @Svetoslav points out: we allow the $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ to be any vectors in $X$, rather than restrcting them to be in $L = \\text{span}(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. Let $\\mathbb{F}$ be the field of our vector space. We're given that $x_1, \\dots, x_n \\in X$ is independent, which is to say that the linear map $T :\\mathbb F^n \\to X$ given by \n$$\nT(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = \\sum a_i x_i \n$$\nis injective. In particular, $T$ is not the zero-map, so it has operator norm\n$$\n\\|T\\|_{\\text{op}} = \\sup_{0 \\neq a \\in \\mathbb{F}^n} \\frac{\\|T a \\|}{\\| a \\|_\\infty}\n$$\nwhich is positive (see this by taking any $a$ with $Ta \\neq 0$). (Here, we've given $\\mathbb{F}^n$ the sup norm $\\| a \\|_\\infty = \\sup\\{|a_1|, \\dots, |a_n|\\}$.) We prove your claim by contradiction: suppose that for all $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exist $y_1, \\dots, y_n \\in X$ with $\\|y_i\\| < \\varepsilon$ such that $x_1 + y_1, \\dots, x_n + y_n$ is dependent. Then there exists $a = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}^n \\backslash \\{0\\}$ such that\n\\begin{align*}\n0 = \\sum a_i (x_i + y_i) &\\implies \\sum a_i x_i = - \\sum a_i y_i \\\\\n&\\implies \\|Ta\\| = \\left\\| \\sum a_i y_i \\right\\| && \\text{take norms} \\\\\n&\\implies \\|Ta\\| \\leq \\| a \\|_\\infty n \\varepsilon && \\text{triangle inequality} \\\\\n&\\implies \\| T \\|_{\\text{op}} \\leq n \\varepsilon. && a \\neq 0\n\\end{align*}\nSince $\\varepsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, this implies that $\\|T\\|_\\text{op} = 0$, i.e., $T$ is the zero-map, giving us our contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the question is about normed linear spaces and linear independence. We need to show that if we have a set of linearly independent vectors, then there's some epsilon such that adding any vectors with norm less than epsilon to each of them will keep them linearly independent.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. Linear independence means that no non-trivial linear combination of the vectors equals zero. So, for the original vectors x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ, the only solution to a₁x₁ + ... + aₙxₙ = 0 is a₁ = a₂ = ... = aₙ = 0.\n\nNow, we want to show that after adding perturbations y₁, ..., yₙ (each with norm less than epsilon), the new vectors x₁ + y₁, ..., xₙ + yₙ are still linearly independent. So, we need to ensure that for any scalars a₁, ..., aₙ, if a₁(x₁ + y₁) + ... + aₙ(xₙ + yₙ) = 0, then all a_i must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the determinant. If we were in a finite-dimensional space, we could use the determinant function, which is continuous. Since the original vectors are linearly independent, the determinant is non-zero. Perturbing them slightly would keep the determinant away from zero. But since this is a general normed linear space, which might be infinite-dimensional, we can't use determinants directly. Hmm, so maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAnother idea: Suppose, for contradiction, that no such epsilon exists. Then, for every epsilon > 0, there exist y_i with ||y_i|| < epsilon such that x₁ + y₁, ..., xₙ + yₙ are linearly dependent. So, there exist scalars a₁, ..., aₙ, not all zero, such that sum a_i(x_i + y_i) = 0. Maybe we can normalize the coefficients so that their sum is 1 or something. Let's say, assume that the maximum |a_i| is 1. Then, as epsilon approaches zero, the y_i terms become negligible. But how does that help?\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that linear independence is an open condition. In finite dimensions, the set of linearly independent tuples is open in the space of tuples. But here, we are in a general normed space. However, the problem is only about a finite number of vectors, so maybe we can use some compactness argument.\n\nAlternatively, consider the map from the coefficients (a₁, ..., aₙ) to the norm of the linear combination. Since the original vectors are linearly independent, the infimum of ||sum a_i x_i|| over all coefficients with ||a||=1 (say, max norm) is positive. Let's denote this infimum as c > 0. Then, if we perturb each x_i by y_i with ||y_i|| < epsilon, then the difference between the original linear combination and the perturbed one is ||sum a_i y_i|| ≤ sum |a_i| ||y_i|| ≤ n * epsilon * max |a_i|. If we take epsilon small enough so that this difference is less than c/2, then the perturbed combination cannot be zero unless the original combination was zero, which would require all a_i to be zero. That might work.\n\nLet me formalize that. Let’s consider the unit sphere of coefficients, i.e., scalars a₁, ..., aₙ with max |a_i| = 1. The function f(a₁,...,aₙ) = ||sum a_i x_i|| is continuous. Since the x_i are linearly independent, f is always positive on this compact set (assuming the space is finite-dimensional, but wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces closed bounded sets aren't necessarily compact). Hmm, maybe that's an issue. Wait, but the coefficients are finite, so even in infinite-dimensional spaces, the coefficients are in a finite-dimensional space. The unit sphere in coefficients is compact (Heine-Borel in R^n or C^n). Then the function f attains its minimum on this compact set, which is positive. Let’s denote c = min{ ||sum a_i x_i|| : max |a_i| = 1 } > 0.\n\nNow, for the perturbed vectors, consider ||sum a_i (x_i + y_i)|| = ||sum a_i x_i + sum a_i y_i||. Using the reverse triangle inequality, we have:\n\n||sum a_i x_i + sum a_i y_i|| ≥ ||sum a_i x_i|| - ||sum a_i y_i||.\n\nIf we can ensure that ||sum a_i y_i|| < c/2, then the entire expression would be ≥ c - c/2 = c/2 > 0, implying that the perturbed combination cannot be zero. Therefore, the perturbed vectors are linearly independent.\n\nBut ||sum a_i y_i|| ≤ sum |a_i| ||y_i|| ≤ sum (max |a_j|) ||y_i|| ≤ n * max |a_j| * max ||y_i||. Since we have max |a_j| = 1 (because we normalized), this is ≤ n * max ||y_i||. Therefore, to have n * max ||y_i|| < c/2, we need max ||y_i|| < c/(2n). Therefore, setting epsilon = c/(2n) would work.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal value c of ||sum a_i x_i|| over all coefficients with max |a_i| = 1. Since the x_i are linearly independent, this c is positive. Then choosing epsilon as c/(2n) ensures that any perturbation smaller than epsilon preserves linear independence.\n\nTherefore, the answer should involve defining epsilon in terms of this minimal value c, which exists due to the linear independence of the original vectors and compactness of the coefficients' unit sphere.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any assumptions I might have missed. The problem states that X is a normed linear space, and the vectors x₁,...,xₙ are linearly independent. There's no mention of finite dimensionality, but the argument above doesn't require X to be finite-dimensional because the coefficients a_i are from a finite-dimensional space (K^n, where K is the scalar field), so the unit sphere there is compact, and the function f is continuous. Therefore, the infimum is attained and positive.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- X is a normed linear space.\n- x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are linearly independent vectors in X.\n- y₁, y₂, ..., yₙ are vectors in X with ||y_i|| < ε for each i.\n- The problem is to find ε > 0 such that x₁ + y₁, ..., xₙ + yₙ are linearly independent.\n\nBut in the example given, the user split assumptions into one per line, each about one object. So for the original problem here:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed linear space.\n- $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are linearly independent vectors in $X$.\n- $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n$ are vectors in $X$.\n- $\\|y_i\\| < \\epsilon$ for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that $x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \\ldots, x_n + y_n$ are linearly independent.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is already structured as such, so maybe in the formatted problem, we don't need to list the y_i's existence as assumptions but rather as part of the problem. Wait, let's look at the example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe that example is not correctly formatted. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. That seems incorrect. But the user provided that as an example, so perhaps they wanted to filter out some parts? Hmm, maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"Let $(X,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ be a normed linear space and $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ be $n$ linearly independent vectors in $X$. Show that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that if $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{n} \\in X$ with $\\|y_{i}\\| < \\epsilon$, $i = 1,2,\\ldots,n$, then $x_{1} + y_{1}, x_{2} + y_{2},\\ldots,x_{n} + y_{n}$ are also linearly independent vectors in $X$.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed linear space.\n\n2. $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are linearly independent vectors in $X$.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that for any $y_i$ with $\\|y_i\\| < \\epsilon$, the vectors $x_i + y_i$ are linearly independent.\n\nIn the example, the user might have extracted assumptions from the problem statement. But in this case, the problem doesn't have hidden assumptions beyond what's given. So the formatted problem should list the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed linear space.\n- $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are linearly independent vectors in $X$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that if $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n \\in X$ satisfy $\\|y_i\\| < \\epsilon$ for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, then $x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \\ldots, x_n + y_n$ are also linearly independent.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they included the divisibility by 7 even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, that example seems wrong. The original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Maybe there was a mistake there. But in this case, we need to follow the user's example structure, even if it's incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut given the current problem, we need to list the assumptions as given in the problem statement. So in this case, the assumptions are the space being a normed linear space and the vectors being linearly independent. The problem is to find epsilon such that perturbations within epsilon maintain linear independence.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- $(X, \\|\\cdot\\|)$ is a normed linear space.\n- $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are linearly independent vectors in $X$.\n\nProblem:\n\nShow that there exists $\\epsilon > 0$ such that if $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n \\in X$ satisfy $\\|y_i\\| < \\epsilon$ for each $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, then $x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2, \\ldots, x_n + y_n$ are linearly independent.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The user's example might have been incorrect, but following the instructions, we need to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line. In the original problem, the only assumptions are the space being normed and the vectors being linearly independent. The rest is part of the problem statement.",
