    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that the following polynomial is not solvable by radicals: $$p(x) = x^5 - 4x + 2 $$ First, by Eisenstein is irreducible. (It is not difficult to see that this polynomial has exactly 3 real roots) How can I proceed? Thank you!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Roadmap for work below: It will suffice to show that the polynomial has an unsolvable Galois group, namely $S_5$ .  To do this, we will show that the Galois group, when viewed as a permutation group, has a $5$ -cycle and a $2$ -cycle; these serve as a generating set for $S_5$ . Let $K$ be the splitting field of $f$ .  Going forward, it will be helpful to think of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\subseteq S_5$ as a permutation group acting on the five roots of $f$ . Now, since $f$ is an irreducible quintic, we can adjoin one of its real roots to $\\mathbb{Q}$ to yield a degree- $5$ extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ , giving the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha) \\subset K$ .  Applying the multiplicativity formula , $|\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})| = [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 5\\cdot[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)]$ , so we see that $5$ divides $|\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})|$ .  Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem , there must exist an element in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ of order $5$ .  This element is necessarily a $5$ -cycle (easy to see if you think about decomposing the element into disjoint cycles; what's the order of such a decomposition in terms of the lengths of the disjoint cycles?). Moving on, you've already noted that the polynomial has exactly two complex roots which are necessarily complex conjugates , say $a + bi$ and $a-bi$ .  There exists a $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ , namely complex conjugation, wherein $\\phi(a+bi) = a-bi$ and fixes the $3$ real roots.  In particular, $\\phi$ is a $2$ -cycle. Next, it is a theorem that any $2$ -cycle together with any $p$ -cycle will generate the entire symmetric group $S_p$ for any prime $p$ .  From this, we can conclude that $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$ . All that remains is to show that $S_5$ is not a solvable group. $S_5$ cannot be solvable because $A_5$ is its only normal subgroup , and $A_5$ has no normal subgroups , so we cannot construct a chain $\\{e\\} = G_0 \\subset G_1 \\subset \\cdots \\subset G_n = S_5$ such that each $G_{j-1}$ is normal in $G_j$ and $G_{j}/G_{j-1}$ is abelian. Therefore , we can conclude the roots of $f$ are not solvable by radicals. Edit : $ \\ $ SteveD in the comments below has brought my attention to Jordan's theorem , which states that, if a subgroup $H \\leq S_n$ is primitive and contains a $p$ -cycle for a prime $p< n \\! - \\! 2$ , then $H \\cong S_n \\text{ or } A_n$ .  One can also show that transitive groups of prime order are primitive, which would allow us to conclude $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_n \\text{ or } A_n$ after demonstrating the existence of a $5$ -cycle or of a $2$ -cycle in this group.  From here, we are able to conclude that the polynomial cannot be solvable by radicals since neither $S_n$ nor $A_n$ is solvable.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the polynomial p(x) = x^5 - 4x + 2 isn't solvable by radicals. First, I need to recall what conditions make a polynomial unsolvable by radicals. From Galois theory, a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group. So the key here is to find the Galois group of p(x) and check if it's solvable.\n\nThe problem mentions that the polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion. Let me verify that. Eisenstein applies if there's a prime number that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and the constant term isn't divisible by the square of that prime. The polynomial is x^5 -4x +2. If we try p=2, the coefficients are 1 (x^5), 0 (x^4), 0 (x^3), 0 (x^2), -4 (x), and 2 (constant). The coefficients except leading are 0,0,0,-4,2. 2 divides -4 and 2, but 2^2=4 doesn't divide 2. Wait, but the coefficient of x is -4, which is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Wait, Eisenstein here: the prime 2 divides all the coefficients except the leading term (which is 1), and 2^2 doesn't divide the constant term 2. So yes, Eisenstein applies with p=2. So the polynomial is indeed irreducible.\n\nNext, the user says the polynomial has exactly three real roots. Let's think about that. To determine the number of real roots, we can look at the derivative. The derivative of p(x) is 5x^4 -4. Setting this equal to zero gives x^4 = 4/5, so x = ±(4/5)^{1/4}. These are two real critical points. Let's compute p at these points to check the number of real roots. Since the polynomial is degree 5, it has at least one real root, and since it's continuous, with leading term x^5, it goes from -infinity to +infinity. Let's see the behavior at specific points: p(-2) = (-32) - (-8) +2 = -22; p(0)=0 -0 +2=2; p(1)=1 -4 +2= -1; p(2)=32 -8 +2=26. So between -2 and 0, there's a root (from -22 to 2). Then between 0 and 1, from 2 to -1, another root. Then from 1 to 2, from -1 to 26, another root. So that's three real roots. But the derivative has two critical points, so the graph should have two local extrema. Wait, maybe there's a maximum and a minimum. Let me calculate the critical points more carefully. The critical points at x = ±(4/5)^{1/4} ≈ ±0.945. Let's compute p at x=0.945: approximately (0.945)^5 -4*(0.945) +2. Let's estimate: (0.945)^5 is roughly (0.9)^5=0.59049, but 0.945 is a bit higher, maybe around 0.7? Let me compute 0.945^2 ≈ 0.893; 0.945^4 ≈ (0.893)^2 ≈ 0.797; then 0.945^5 ≈ 0.797*0.945 ≈ 0.754. Then 0.754 -4*0.945 +2 ≈ 0.754 -3.78 +2 ≈ -1.026. Similarly at x=-0.945: (-0.945)^5 is negative, so ≈ -0.754. Then -4*(-0.945)=3.78. So total ≈ -0.754 +3.78 +2 ≈ 5.026. So at x=0.945, p(x)≈-1.026 (local minimum), and at x=-0.945, p(x)≈5.026 (local maximum). So the function decreases from -infinity to x=-0.945, reaching a local max at ~5.026, then decreases to x=0.945 with a local min at ~-1.026, then increases to infinity. So crossing the x-axis three times: once left of x=-0.945, once between -0.945 and 0.945, and once right of 0.945. Wait, but according to the earlier values: p(-2)=-22, p(-0.945)≈5.026, so between -2 and -0.945, p goes from -22 to 5.026, so one real root there. Then between -0.945 and 0.945, p starts at 5.026, goes down to -1.026, so crosses the x-axis once. Then from 0.945 onwards, p goes from -1.026 to +infinity, crossing once. So total three real roots, and two complex conjugate roots. That makes sense.\n\nNow, since the polynomial is irreducible of degree 5, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of S5. The possible transitive subgroups of S5 are: the cyclic group of order 5, the dihedral group D5, the Frobenius group F20 (the affine linear group AGL(1,5)), A5, and S5. The solvable ones are the cyclic, D5, F20; the non-solvable ones are A5 and S5. So we need to determine which one is the Galois group here.\n\nSince the polynomial has exactly three real roots, the Galois group must contain complex conjugation, which is a transposition (a 2-cycle) in S5, because complex conjugation will swap the two complex roots. So the presence of a transposition can help identify the Galois group.\n\nIf the Galois group contains a transposition and a 5-cycle (since the polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group is transitive, hence has order divisible by 5, so by Cauchy's theorem, contains an element of order 5, which is a 5-cycle in S5). A theorem states that if a transitive subgroup of S5 contains a 5-cycle and a transposition, then it must be S5 itself. Hence, if we can show that the Galois group contains both a 5-cycle and a transposition, then it's S5, which is not solvable, hence the polynomial isn't solvable by radicals.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are: show the Galois group contains a 5-cycle and a transposition. Since the polynomial is irreducible, the Galois group is transitive, hence has a 5-cycle (but need to confirm). The presence of a transposition comes from complex conjugation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the Galois group by reducing modulo primes and looking at the factorization, but since this might be complicated, another approach is to check the discriminant and see if it's a square. If the discriminant is not a square, then the Galois group is not contained in A5, so it must be S5 if it's the only other option. Let's compute the discriminant of the polynomial. For a general quintic, the discriminant is complicated, but maybe we can use some properties or compute modulo primes.\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots, the Galois group acts on the roots by permuting them. The complex conjugation gives a transposition. If the Galois group also contains a 5-cycle, then by the theorem, it's S5. So we need to confirm that the Galois group has a 5-cycle. One way to do this is to use Dedekind's theorem: reduce the polynomial modulo a prime not dividing the discriminant, and check that the factorization modulo that prime has a cycle type that includes a 5-cycle. For example, if modulo some prime, the polynomial factors as a linear term times a quartic, then the Galois group contains a 4-cycle, but if it factors as a 5-cycle (i.e., irreducible modulo that prime), then the Galois group contains a 5-cycle. But we need to check this.\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial is irreducible over Q, then the Galois group must act transitively, hence has order divisible by 5. If the discriminant is not a square, then the Galois group is not contained in A5, so it must be S5. Let's check the discriminant. But calculating the discriminant for a quintic is messy. Let's see: discriminant of x^5 + a x + b is 5^5 b^4 + 256 a^5. Wait, not sure. Let me look up the discriminant formula for x^5 + px + q. According to some references, the discriminant D of x^5 + px + q is 5^5 q^4 + 256 p^5. So for our polynomial x^5 -4x +2, p = -4, q =2. So D = 5^5*(2)^4 + 256*(-4)^5 = 3125*16 + 256*(-1024) = 50000 - 262144 = -212144. Now check if this is a square. The discriminant is negative, so sqrt(D) is imaginary, but in the context of Galois groups, the discriminant being a square in Q. Since D is -212144, which is -212144 = -16*13259. 13259 is a prime? Let me check: 13259 divided by small primes: 13259 ÷ 7 = 1894.14… no. ÷13=1020. So not divisible by 7, 13. Maybe 13259 is prime. In any case, the discriminant is not a perfect square in Q. Therefore, the Galois group is not contained in A5, hence must be S5. Therefore, since S5 is not solvable, the polynomial is not solvable by radicals.\n\nSo putting this together: the polynomial is irreducible (by Eisenstein), has exactly three real roots (so Galois group contains a transposition), discriminant is not a square (so Galois group not in A5), hence Galois group is S5, which is not solvable. Therefore, the polynomial isn't solvable by radicals.",
