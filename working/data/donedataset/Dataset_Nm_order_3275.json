    "Content": "I'm asked to prove that the famous equation $$x^3+y^3=z^3$$ has no integer (non-trivial) solutions, i.e. FLT for $n=3$ I'm aware that on this website there are solutions using methods of Number Theory (the infinite descendant proof for example, or well, Wiles' Theorem) But my lecturer told us it can be done by methods of Algebraic Number Theory, i.e. using certain number fields and properties of them. As an hint, he told us to consider the extension $$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$$ and using the result that characterises ramified or non-ramified primes in quadratic fields. Now I'd be lying saying that I have some idea on how to attack this problem. I thought that something helpful would come using some analogue of the reasoning of finding roots of $x^2+y^2=z^2$, i.e. reasoning with the norm of a specific quadratic extension, but the norm gives a quadratic relation in this case, and not a cubic one. On the other hand I thought, ok let's consider cubic extension, but for $$\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{d})$$ the norm of $a+b\\sqrt[3]{d}+c\\sqrt[3]{d^2} $  is $$a^3+b^3d+c^3d^2-3abc$$ and so I have a kind of cubic relation, BUT I don't know how to get rid of the $abc$ term. I'm aware that this is not a big effort, but this is what I'm able to think as a strategy to attack this problem. Instead of full solutions I'd prefer suggestion and reasonings, otherwise I'll never learn how to proceed with these kind of problems :) Thanks in advance",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fermat's equation for cubes is a common introduction to lecture notes on algebraic number theory, because it motivates to study rings of integers in a number field, and partly has been developed even for such Diophantine problems, e.g., Kummer's work concerning generalizing factorization to ideals. \nFor the equation $x^3+y^3=z^3$ the number field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ with a third primitive root of unity $\\zeta=e^{2\\pi i/3}$. Its ring of integers is given by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$, which is indeed a factorial ring (because it is Euclidean). Its units are given by $\\pm 1,\\pm \\zeta,\\pm\\zeta^{-1}$. This is crucial to prove Euler's result: Theorem(Euler $1770$) : The equation $x^3+y^3=z^3$ has no non-trivial integer solutions. The proof uses divisibility properties of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$, starting from the equation\n$$\nz^3=x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x+\\zeta y)(x+\\zeta^2y).\n$$ \nThe first case is $p=3\\nmid xyz$. We may suppose that $x,y,z$ are coprime. We have $z^3\\equiv \\pm 1\\bmod 9$ and $x^3+y^3\\equiv -2,0,2 \\bmod 9$, so that $x^3+y^3\\neq z^3$, a contradiction. Hence we suppose that $3\\mid xyz$, i.e., say, $3\\mid z$ and $3\\nmid xy$. Now we reformulate the equation as\n$$\nx^3+y^3=(3^mz)^3,\n$$\nwith $x,y,z$ pairwise coprime and $3\\nmid xyz$,\nwhere we have solved the case $m=0$. The idea is now to use descent, i.e., to reduce it to the case $m=0$. The above equation becomes\n$$\n(3^mz)^3=(x+y)(x+\\zeta y)(x+\\zeta^2y),\n$$\nwhere the three factors are not coprime, because $1-\\zeta$ is a common factor, because of $3=(1-\\zeta)(1-\\zeta^2)$, so that $(1-\\zeta)\\mid 3\\mid (x+y)$.\nHowever, since $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$ is factorial, all factors are cubes, i.e. ,\n$x+y=3^{3m-1}c^3$ with some $c\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and so on. This finishes the proof, after some computations in this ring. Unfortunately, this idea does not work for $x^p+y^p=z^p$ for primes $p$, except for $p\\le 19$, because otherwise the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_p]$ is no longer factorial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the original question from Math Stack Exchange according to the specified structure. The original question is about proving that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no non-trivial integer solutions using methods from Algebraic Number Theory, specifically involving the field Q(√3) and properties related to ramified primes.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key points are:\n\n1. The equation is x³ + y³ = z³ (FLT for n=3).\n2. The task is to prove there are no non-trivial integer solutions.\n3. The method required is Algebraic Number Theory.\n4. The hint given is to consider the extension Q(√3) and use results about ramified or non-ramified primes in quadratic fields.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would include the conditions mentioned. Each assumption should be a single line. Let's break them down:\n\n- The equation in question is x³ + y³ = z³.\n- The solutions considered are integers.\n- The solutions are non-trivial (so x, y, z not zero).\n- The method involves Algebraic Number Theory.\n- The extension field Q(√3) is to be considered.\n- The proof should use properties of ramified or non-ramified primes in quadratic fields.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables (n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem's assumptions are more about the conditions of the problem and the required method. However, the user's example focused on the mathematical conditions of the problem variables rather than the method. But in this case, the method is part of the problem's constraints as specified by the lecturer.\n\nThe problem statement itself is to prove that the equation has no non-trivial integer solutions using the mentioned methods. So, the assumptions include the conditions on the variables (integer, non-trivial) and the method constraints (using Q(√3) and ramification properties).\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x, y, z are integers.\n- The equation x³ + y³ = z³ is considered.\n- The solutions are non-trivial (x, y, z ≠ 0).\n- The proof must use methods of Algebraic Number Theory.\n- The extension field Q(√3) is used in the proof.\n- Properties of ramified and non-ramified primes in quadratic fields are applied.\n\nProblem: Prove that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no non-trivial integer solutions.\n\nWait, but the original question mentions that the lecturer told them to use Q(√3) and ramified primes. So maybe the assumptions should include that the extension is Q(√3) and the use of ramification properties. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the method is part of the problem's requirements. However, the user's example didn't include method-related assumptions, only mathematical conditions. So perhaps the method constraints are part of the problem statement, not assumptions.\n\nWait, looking back at the example given:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the assumptions are about the variables and their properties. The method is part of the problem statement in the original question, but in the formatted example, the method isn't an assumption. So in the current problem, the method (using Algebraic Number Theory, Q(√3), ramified primes) would be part of the problem statement, not assumptions. The assumptions are about the variables and their conditions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\n- x, y, z are integers.\n- The solutions are non-trivial (x, y, z ≠ 0).\n\nBut the problem statement would include the method requirement. Wait, the original question says: \"prove that the equation has no integer solutions using methods of Algebraic Number Theory... consider the extension Q(√3) and use results about ramified primes.\"\n\nSo in the formatted problem, the problem statement should include the method constraint. But according to the example, the problem statement is just the mathematical problem. However, in the example, the problem statement was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the method (using ANT, Q(√3), ramified primes) is part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Because in the example, the method wasn't mentioned in assumptions, only the conditions on variables.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the variables (integers, non-trivial), and the problem statement would include the requirement to use the specified methods.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the problem statement is just the mathematical problem, with assumptions about variables. However, in this case, the method is part of the problem's instruction. So perhaps the problem statement should be: \"Prove using methods of Algebraic Number Theory, specifically considering the extension Q(√3) and properties of ramified primes, that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no non-trivial integer solutions.\"\n\nBut to follow the example's structure, the problem statement should be concise, and the assumptions are about the variables. The method would be part of the problem statement, but in the example, the problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. So the method wasn't part of the problem statement in the example. Therefore, in this case, the method is part of the problem's instruction, not the assumptions. Therefore, the problem statement should include the method requirement.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are integers,\nThe solutions are non-trivial (x, y, z ≠ 0).\nProblem:\nProve using methods of Algebraic Number Theory, specifically the extension ℚ(√3) and properties of ramified primes, that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no non-trivial integer solutions.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part is just the problem statement, so maybe the method is part of the problem. So the assumptions are only about the variables, and the problem includes the method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just the equation part, and the method is part of the problem's context. But the example includes the divisibility by 91 as the problem, with assumptions on n. So here, the problem is the equation, and the method is part of the instructions. The user's example didn't include the method in the problem statement, but the original problem here specifies that the proof must use certain methods. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the method as part of the problem statement.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are integers,\nSolutions are non-trivial (x, y, z ≠ 0).\nProblem:\nProve that the equation x³ + y³ = z³ has no non-trivial integer solutions using methods of Algebraic Number Theory, specifically considering the extension ℚ(√3) and properties of ramified primes.\n\nBut the example didn't include the method in the problem statement. The original example's problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. The method (using algebraic number theory) here is part of the problem's requirements, so it should be included in the problem statement.\n\nYes, in the original question, the user is instructed to use methods of Algebraic Number Theory, so that's part of the problem's requirement. Therefore, the problem statement should include that. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the problem statement as \"Prove that... using methods of Algebraic Number Theory...\".\n\nHence, the final formatted problem is as above.",
