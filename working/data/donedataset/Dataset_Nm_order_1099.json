    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a different approach than the one Qiaochu is suggesting, assuming you have proved that every point in a Riemannian manifold has a normal neighborhood: A neighborhood for which any two points in the neighborhood can be connected by a unique minimizing geodesic. First, a lemma: Suppose $M$ is a (connected) Riemannian manifold and $f:M\\rightarrow M$ is an isometry.  Suppose further that for some $p\\in M$, that $f(p) = p$ and $d_p f = Id$.  Then $f = Id$. Proof (sketch):  Let $X \\subseteq M$ with $X = \\{q\\in M|$ $f(q) = q$ and $d_q f = Id \\}$.  Then $p\\in X$ by definition so $X$ is nonempty.  We will show $X$ is both open and closed. $X$ is closed because it's defined by equations.  $X$ is open becuase if $q\\in X$, using a normal neighborhood $U$ and the fact that $f(exp_q(tv)) = exp_{f(q)}(t$ $d_q f$ $v)$ shows all points $r\\in U$ satisfy $f(r) = r$.  If $d_r f \\neq Id$, draw a small triangle connecting $r, q$ and $exp(tv)$ where $d_r f v \\neq v$ and $t$ is very small.  Appealing to the fact that vertices of the triangle have unique minimizing geodesics between them will give a contradiction, showing $d_r f = Id$. Thus, $X$ is both open and closed and so, since $M$ is connected, $X = \\emptyset $ or $X = M$.  But $p\\in X$, so $X = M$.  But this says that $f(q) = q$ for all $q\\in M$ (and that $d_q f = Id$, but we don't really care about that), so $f$ is the identity map. With this lemma proved, we get a pretty easy corollary:  An isometry is determined by where it sends one point and what its differential does at that point. This in turn gives a potential solution to our problem:  If you can show 1) Every linear orthogonal map is an isometry of $S^n$ and 2) Given any $p, q \\in S^n$, and any o.n. bases $\\{v_1,...,v_n\\}$ and $\\{w_1,...,w_n\\}$ of $T_p S^n$ and $T_q S^n$ respectively, there is a linear orthogonal map taking $p$ to $q$ and $\\{v_1,...,v_n\\}$ to $\\{w_1,...,w_n\\}$, Then, it follows that you've found all of the isometries of $S^n$. The proof of 1) is straightforward owing to the fact that the linear orthogonal matrices preserve the metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and $S^n$ inherits it's metric from $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The proof of 2) is slightly more involved, but not so bad:  First, prove that you can assume wlog that $p = q = $ north pole and that $\\{v_1,...,v_n\\} = \\{e_2,...,e_{n+1}\\}$ using the standard o.n. basis $\\{e_1,...,e_{n+1}\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.  From here, if you think about it, given $\\{ w_1,...,w_n\\}$, you can explicitly write down the linear orthgonal matrix you want.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that they want the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem mentioned an integer n and that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, there was no mention of n being divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe that was a mistake? Or maybe the example is incorrect? But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions based on their example.\n\nNow, the current problem to format is from the Math Stack Exchange question about isometries of the sphere S^n. The original question asks to prove that the isometries of S^n (with the induced metric) are restrictions of linear orthogonal transformations. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is about isometries of the n-sphere. So, what are the given conditions here? Let's parse the question:\n\n- The sphere S^n is a subset of R^{n+1}.\n- The metric on S^n is the induced metric from R^{n+1}.\n- The task is to prove that any isometry of S^n (with this induced metric) is the restriction of a linear orthogonal transformation on R^{n+1}.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The sphere is S^n, which is a subset of R^{n+1}.\n2. The metric on S^n is induced by the Euclidean metric of R^{n+1}.\n3. The isometries considered are those with respect to this induced metric.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions. Then, the problem is to prove that these isometries are restrictions of linear orthogonal transformations.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). However, in this current problem, there's no condition on n except that it's the dimension of the sphere. So maybe the assumptions here are more about the setup of the problem rather than conditions on variables. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Prove that the isometries of S^n ⊂ R^{n+1}, with the induced metric, are restrictions to S^n of the linear orthogonal transformations.\"\n\nSo, the key elements are:\n\n- S^n is embedded in R^{n+1}.\n- The metric on S^n is induced from R^{n+1}.\n- The isometries in question are those of S^n with this metric.\n- The problem is to show each such isometry comes from an orthogonal linear transformation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The sphere S^n is a subset of R^{n+1}.\n2. The metric on S^n is induced by the Euclidean metric on R^{n+1}.\n3. The isometries are considered with respect to this induced metric.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. Then the problem is to prove that these isometries are the restrictions of linear orthogonal transformations.\n\nI think that's correct. The example given by the user had assumptions about the variable n, but in this problem, the assumptions are about the structure of the sphere and the metric. So each of those points should be individual assumptions.",
