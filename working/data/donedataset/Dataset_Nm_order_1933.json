    "Content": "I have a math problem, and I have no idea how to solve it. I first saw it over on the Code Golf StackExchange, here . The poster there hinted at knowing that there is a proof, but no proof was provided. We start with a pair of integers $a$ and $b$. We double one and add one to the other. We have the power to decide which to double and which to increment. We repeat this \"doubling/+1\" process, until the two integers are equal. For example, starting with $(2, 5)$ we can double the 5 and increment the 2 to give $(3, 10)$. Then, we can double the three and increment the 10 for $(6, 11)$. We can double the six and increment the 11 for $(12, 12)$ - and now we have made the numbers equal. Given any pair of integers, it it always possible to make them equal using these steps? Partial Proof All pairs of negative numbers will terminate. This relies on the fact that doubling 0 is 0. If we start with a pair of negative numbers, we can repeatedly add one to one of the numbers until it hits 0. While the other number will have been doubled several times, we can repeatedly decrement it until it too, hits 0. $(-6, -3) \\to (-12, -2) \\to (-24, -1) \\to (-48, 0) \\to (-47, 0) \\to (-46, 0) \\to \\cdots \\to (0, 0)$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This problem has been solved on reddit by our very own Lopsy : https://www.reddit.com/r/mathriddles/comments/2v6eaj/doubling_and_adding_1/ I will summarize this answer. Call the operation $(x,y)\\mapsto (x+1,2y) $ operation $1$, and call the other one $(x,y)\\mapsto(2x,y+1) $ operation $2$. You start with a pair $(a,a+b)$, where $a,b>0$ (possibly after switching the numbers). Let $\\ell$ be a number to be chosen later: perform the following actions: operation #1 at total of $b$ times: $$(a+b,2^b(a+b))$$ operation #2 a total $b-\\ell+1$ times: $$(2^{b-\\ell+1}(a+b),2^b(a+b)+b-\\ell+1)$$ operation #1 once: $$(2^{b-\\ell+1}(a+b)+1,2^{b+1}(a+b)+2b-2\\ell+2)$$ operation #2 a total $\\ell$ times:  $$(2^{b+1}(a+b)+2^\\ell,2^{b+1}(a+b)+2b-\\ell+2)$$ Initially, the absolute difference between the numbers was $b$, and now it is \n$$\n|2^\\ell-2b+\\ell-2|\\tag{$*$}\n$$\nAs long as we can choose $\\ell$ so that $(*)$ is less than $b$, than we have a procedure to decrease the absolute difference of the two numbers, which can be repeated until they are equal. It turns out that for all $b\\ge 2$, there exists an $\\ell$ which satisfies $(*)$. Rearranging, this equivalent to solving\n$$\nb\\le 2^{\\ell}+\\ell-2\\le 3b\\tag{$**$}\n$$ \nThe remainder of the proof is then to (i) show that $(**)$ has a solution for all $b\\ge 2$, which may involve brute force checking for some small cases, and to (ii) show how to handle the special case $(a,a+1)$ (there exists a 10 step solution).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking whether, given any pair of integers a and b, it's always possible to make them equal by repeatedly choosing to double one and increment the other. The example given starts with (2,5) and after a few steps reaches (12,12). The user also mentions that for negative numbers, there's a partial proof involving driving one number to zero and then adjusting the other.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that we start with a pair of integers, and in each step, we can double one and add one to the other. The goal is to make them equal. The original question is whether this is always possible for any pair of integers.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The initial pair consists of two integers a and b.\n- In each step, one of the numbers is doubled, and the other is incremented by 1.\n- The process is repeated until both numbers are equal.\n\nWait, but in the example, they start with (2,5) and choose which one to double and which to increment each time. So the key assumptions are that each step allows either doubling the first and incrementing the second or doubling the second and incrementing the first. However, the original problem says \"double one and increment the other\", so each step you have to choose which one to double and which to increment. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The process starts with two integers a and b.\n- Each step involves doubling one integer and incrementing the other by 1.\n- The choice of which to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n- The process terminates when the two integers are equal.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on a and b except that they are integers. The user's partial proof mentions that for negative numbers, it's possible by bringing one to zero and then adjusting. So perhaps the assumptions are just that a and b are integers, and the operations can be applied in any order until they're equal.\n\nBut the original question is whether it's always possible to make them equal regardless of the starting integers. So the problem statement is: Given any pair of integers a and b, is it always possible to make them equal using these operations?\n\nSo for the formatted problem, the assumptions should list all the given conditions. Let's break them down:\n\n1. The process starts with two integers a and b.\n2. In each step, one integer is doubled and the other is incremented by 1.\n3. The choice of which integer to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n4. The process continues until the two integers are equal.\n\nBut the original problem's main question is whether termination (i.e., reaching equal numbers) is always possible for any initial a and b. The user provided an example where starting from (2,5), it's possible, and a partial proof for negative numbers.\n\nSo when structuring the assumptions, each line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me list them:\n\nAssumption:\n- a and b are integers.\n- In each step, one of the numbers is doubled.\n- In each step, the other number is incremented by 1.\n- The choice of which number to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n- The process terminates when the two numbers are equal.\n\nWait, but the termination is the goal, not an assumption. The problem is whether the process can always terminate. So the assumptions are the starting conditions and the allowed operations. The problem is to prove that termination is always possible.\n\nSo revised assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial pair consists of two integers a and b.\n- Each step allows doubling one integer and incrementing the other by 1.\n- The choice of which integer to double and which to increment is made freely at each step.\n\nProblem:\nGiven any pair of integers a and b, is it always possible to make them equal using the described steps?\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Given a pair of integers, double one and increment the other until equality\". The user wants to know if it's always possible. So the formatted problem should capture this.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the formatted problem had:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in that example, the assumptions were the conditions given in the problem, not the operations. So here, the problem's assumptions would be the starting conditions and the allowed operations.\n\nBut in the original problem, the allowed operations are part of the process, not assumptions on the initial values. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- Start with two integers a and b.\n- At each step, choose to either:\n   - Double a and increment b by 1, or\n   - Double b and increment a by 1.\n- Repeat until a = b.\n\nBut the problem is whether for any initial a and b, this process can terminate. So the problem is to prove that for any integers a and b, there exists a sequence of operations leading to a = b.\n\nTherefore, the formatted assumptions would list the initial conditions and the allowed operations, each as separate points.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- a and b are integers.\n- In each step, either:\n   - a is doubled and b is incremented by 1, or\n   - b is doubled and a is incremented by 1.\n- The process is repeated until a equals b.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property applied to one object. So splitting the operations into separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial values a and b are integers.\n- In each step, one of the numbers is doubled.\n- In each step, the other number is incremented by 1.\n- The choice of which number to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n- The process terminates when a and b are equal.\n\nWait, but the termination is the goal, not an assumption. The problem is to prove that termination is possible, so the last point should not be an assumption. Instead, the process is defined as continuing until a and b are equal, but the question is whether that's always achievable. So the assumptions are the initial conditions and the allowed operations, and the problem is to determine if termination is always possible.\n\nThus, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The process starts with two integers a and b.\n- Each step involves doubling one integer and incrementing the other integer by 1.\n- The choice of which integer to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any initial integers a and b, the process can terminate with both integers equal.\n\nAlternatively, phrased as a question: Is it always possible to make the two integers equal using the described steps?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was phrased as a statement to prove. The user's original question is asking whether it's always possible. So the problem part should be a statement to prove.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The initial pair consists of two integers a and b.\n- Each step allows doubling one integer and incrementing the other by 1.\n- The choice of which integer to double and which to increment is made at each step.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any integers a and b, the process can terminate with both integers being equal.\n\nAlternatively, as per the example, the problem line could be: \"Prove that given any pair of integers a and b, it is always possible to make them equal using the steps of doubling one and incrementing the other.\"\n\nI think that's the correct structure. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the assumptions are the starting conditions and the allowed operations, and the problem is to prove termination.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.",
