    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assuming we are working with the usual norm (as OP said in comments), suppose $\\ell_{p}$ is an Hilbert space. So its must satisfy for all $u,v$: $$2\\|u\\|_{p}^2 + 2\\|v\\|_{p}^2 = \\|u + v\\|_{p}^2 + \\|u - v\\|_{p}^2.$$ As suggested by martini, take $u=e_{1}=(1,0,...,0,...)$ and $v=e_{2}=(0,1,0,...,0,...)$. Hence, by the last equality, we have $$4=2^{\\frac{2}{p}}+2^{\\frac{2}{p}}$$ Now you can solve the last inequality and verify that $p=2$. On the other hand, if $p=2$, you can easily check that $\\ell_{2}$ is a Hilbert space.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to understand the original problem thoroughly.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the space ℓ_p is a Hilbert space if and only if p = 2. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed, and the problem was restructured. My task is to do the same here.\n\nFirst, I'll read the question carefully. The problem states: Let p be greater than or equal to 1. Show that for the space ℓ_p, which consists of all p-summable sequences with the norm ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^(1/p), there exists an inner product such that the norm squared equals the inner product of u with itself if and only if p = 2.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. p is a real number greater than or equal to 1. This is given in the problem statement.\n2. The space considered is ℓ_p, which is defined as the set of all sequences (u_n) where the sum of |u_n|^p from n=1 to infinity is finite. This defines the space.\n3. The norm on ℓ_p is given by ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^(1/p). This specifies the norm associated with the space.\n4. The problem requires the existence of an inner product <·|·> such that the norm squared equals the inner product, i.e., ||u||^2 = <u|u>. Here, the norm induced by the inner product must match the given norm of the space when squared. But wait, the original norm is ||u||_p, so the equation would actually need to be ||u||_p^2 = <u|u> if the inner product induces a norm that's the square root of the original norm squared. Hmm, maybe I need to check this.\n\nWait, the problem says \"there is an inner product <·|·> s.t. ||u||^2 = <u|u>\". Wait, but the norm in ℓ_p is ||u||_p. So the equation here is ||u||_p^2 = <u|u>, right? Because the norm from the inner product would be sqrt(<u|u>), but here they want the squared norm (from the inner product) to equal the original norm ||u||_p. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the standard inner product induces a norm via ||u|| = sqrt(<u,u>). So if the problem states that ||u||^2 = <u|u>, that's just the standard relation. But here, the problem is saying that the norm of the space ℓ_p (which is ||u||_p) must satisfy that ||u||_p^2 is equal to <u|u>. Therefore, the inner product's induced norm squared (which would be <u|u>) is equal to the ℓ_p norm squared. Therefore, the inner product must be such that <u|u> = ||u||_p^2.\n\nBut for a space to be a Hilbert space, it needs to be complete (which ℓ_p is for p ≥ 1) and the norm must be induced by an inner product. The problem is asking to show that such an inner product exists if and only if p = 2.\n\nSo the key assumptions are about p, the space ℓ_p, its norm, and the existence of an inner product inducing the norm. However, the original problem doesn't mention completeness, but since ℓ_p is known to be a Banach space for p ≥ 1, perhaps that's assumed. But the user's example didn't include implicit assumptions, only the ones explicitly stated. So I need to list only the explicit assumptions.\n\nNow, let's structure this. The assumptions should be each on a separate line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst assumption: p is a real number greater than or equal to 1. (Since the problem says \"Let p be greater than or equal to 1\".)\n\nSecond assumption: The space ℓ_p consists of all sequences (u_n) such that the sum of |u_n|^p from n=1 to infinity is finite. (This defines the space.)\n\nThird assumption: The norm on ℓ_p is given by ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^(1/p). (Defining the norm.)\n\nFourth assumption: There exists an inner product <·|·> on ℓ_p such that ||u||_p^2 = <u|u> for all u in ℓ_p. (This is the condition that the norm squared equals the inner product.)\n\nWait, but the problem says \"there is an inner product ... s.t. ||u||^2 = <u|u>\". Wait, the norm in the problem statement might be a typo. Because if the norm is ||u||_p, then the equation should be <u|u> = ||u||_p^2. However, the original problem says \"s.t. ||u||^2 = <u|u>\". Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Show that for the space [...] there is an inner product <·|·> s.t. ||u||^2 = <u|u> if and only if p=2.\"\n\nWait, the user might have mistyped the norm. The norm in ℓ_p is ||u||_p, but in the problem statement, they wrote ||u||_p as the norm, and then refer to ||u||^2. Perhaps this is a typo, and it should be ||u||_p^2. Otherwise, if ||u|| is the inner product norm, then it's redundant because the inner product norm is always sqrt(<u|u>), so ||u||^2 would be <u|u>. But the problem is trying to say that the norm of the space (which is the ℓ_p norm) is induced by an inner product. Therefore, the correct statement should be that the ℓ_p norm is induced by an inner product if and only if p=2. Hence, the problem might have a typo where they meant ||u||_p^2 = <u|u>, which would imply that the inner product induces the ℓ_p norm. But the way it's written now says ||u||^2 = <u|u>, which is always true for any inner product, but here \"||u||\" would refer to the inner product norm, which is different from the ℓ_p norm unless p=2. So perhaps the problem intended to state that the ℓ_p norm is equal to the inner product norm, which would mean that ||u||_p = sqrt(<u|u>), hence ||u||_p^2 = <u|u>. Therefore, the correct equation should be <u|u> = ||u||_p^2. But the problem as written says ||u||^2 = <u|u>, which might be a misstatement. However, I need to work with the given problem as stated.\n\nGiven that, the problem states that there exists an inner product such that ||u||^2 = <u|u>, where ||u|| is presumably the ℓ_p norm. So the equation would be <u|u> = ||u||_p^2. Therefore, the assumption would be that such an inner product exists, leading to the problem of showing this happens iff p=2.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. p ≥ 1 (as given).\n2. The space ℓ_p is defined as the set of p-summable sequences with the given norm.\n3. The norm is ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n4. There exists an inner product on ℓ_p such that for all u in ℓ_p, ||u||_p^2 = <u|u>.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the user's example included only the necessary conditions. In the example, the original problem mentioned that n is an integer, and then they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but in the original problem, it was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the example might have been a different problem where maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7 unless the problem was misrepresented. Maybe the example was a bad one, but I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem says \"Show that for the space ℓ_p [...] there is an inner product [...] if and only if p=2.\" The key assumptions here are the conditions on p, the definition of ℓ_p, the norm on ℓ_p, and the existence of the inner product with the specified property.\n\nSo listing the assumptions:\n\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\n- ℓ_p is the space of all sequences (u_n) such that the sum of |u_n|^p from n=1 to ∞ is finite.\n- The norm on ℓ_p is given by ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n- There exists an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ on ℓ_p such that ||u||_p² = ⟨u|u⟩ for all u ∈ ℓ_p.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that such an inner product exists iff p=2. Therefore, the assumptions are the general conditions, and the problem is to show the equivalence. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions given, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. p is a real number greater than or equal to 1.\n2. ℓ_p is the space of p-summable sequences with the norm ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n3. There exists an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ on ℓ_p such that ⟨u|u⟩ = ||u||_p².\n\nWait, but the third assumption is actually part of the problem statement's conclusion. The problem is to show that such an inner product exists if and only if p=2. So the assumptions are only the first two, and the third is part of the problem's \"if and only if\" condition. Wait, no. Let me re-express.\n\nThe problem says: \"Show that for the space [...] there is an inner product [...] if and only if p=2.\" So the problem is to prove that such an inner product exists exactly when p=2. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions given for p and the space, and the problem is to show the existence of the inner product iff p=2.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n1. p ≥ 1.\n2. ℓ_p is the space of sequences (u_n) with Σ|u_n|^p < ∞.\n3. The norm on ℓ_p is ||u||_p = (Σ|u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n\nThe problem is to show that there exists an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ such that ||u||_p² = ⟨u|u⟩ if and only if p=2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the user included assumptions from the problem and possibly an extra one. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. That suggests the example might have been incorrectly formatted, possibly confusing the general statement with a specific case. However, I need to follow the user's instruction, which might have intended that the assumptions include any conditions mentioned in the problem, even if they are universal quantifiers.\n\nBut in the current problem, the conditions are that p ≥ 1, ℓ_p is defined as such, and the norm is given. These are the explicit assumptions. The problem is to show the existence of the inner product iff p=2.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- p is a real number greater than or equal to 1.\n- ℓ_p is the space of sequences (u_n) where the sum of |u_n|^p from n=1 to infinity is finite.\n- The norm on ℓ_p is given by ||u||_p = (Σ_{n=1}^∞ |u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ on ℓ_p such that ||u||_p² = ⟨u|u⟩ for all u ∈ ℓ_p if and only if p = 2.\n\nBut each assumption should be on a separate line. Also, the user's example used bullet points with commas, but in the format, it's written as lines. Let me adjust.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\np is a real number greater than or equal to 1,\nℓ_p is the space of all sequences (u_n) such that the sum of |u_n|^p from n=1 to infinity converges,\nthe norm on ℓ_p is defined as ||u||_p = (Σ_{n=1}^∞ |u_n|^p)^{1/p}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists an inner product ⟨·|·⟩ on ℓ_p satisfying ||u||_p² = ⟨u|u⟩ for all u ∈ ℓ_p if and only if p = 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one condition. The first assumption is about p, the second about the space, the third about the norm. Then the problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nI need to make sure there are no markdown elements and that it's properly structured.",
