    "Content": "I don't know about the Sylow Theorems. But I have been wondering about a proof of the fact that a group or order $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes must be cyclic. I can't quite work out the details, but here is the general idea. I would like help with filling in details. I assume that it is already known that $G$ has subgroup(s) of order $p$ and subgroup(s) of order $q$. If $G$ is a group of order $pq$ ($p\\neq q$), then I know that $G$ has a subgroup $H$ of order $p$ and a subgroup $K$ of order $q$. Then $H\\simeq \\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $K\\simeq \\mathbb{Z}_q$. But then $H\\oplus K \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$, so I would think that $H\\oplus K \\simeq G$. I guess one could do an internal direct product instead of an external direct product, but I don't know that $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups. I am asking for help completing this argument. Edit: I see from the comments below that I might need to assume that the smaller prime does not divide the larger prime minus $1$. Or maybe it is enough to assume that the primes are greater than or equal to $3$ (Still distinct).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For a general group of order $p$ and $q$ , there are very few possibilities (though you need Sylow theorems to know this). The fact is, for $p>q$ and $G$ a group of order $pq$ , we must have $$G\\cong C_p\\rtimes C_q$$ where the semi-direct product is defined in terms of some homomorphism $$\\Phi:C_q\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(C_p)\\cong C_{p-1}.$$ If $q$ does not divide $p-1$ , this homomorphism must be trivial and you get $G\\cong C_p\\times C_q\\cong C_{pq}$ . When $\\Phi$ is nontrivial, we can write $\\Phi(c_q^k)=\\phi_k$ . Then, the product structure on $C_p\\rtimes C_q$ is given by $$(c_p^a,c_q^b)(c_p^r,c_q^s)=(c_p^a\\phi_b(c_p)^r,c_q^{b+s}).$$ It is a nice exercise to check that this is a group structure, and $C_p$ is normal. It is also useful to describe the isomorphism $S_3\\to C_3\\rtimes C_2$ explicitly. EDIT: As you are requesting more detail, here you go: Let $G$ be a group of order $pq$ with $p>q$ primes. Using Cauchy's theorem there are (cyclic) subgroups $P=\\langle x\\mid x^p=1\\rangle$ and $Q=\\langle y\\mid y^q=1\\rangle$ of orders $p$ and $q$ , respectively. It follows from the Sylow theorems that $P\\lhd G$ is normal (Since all Sylow $p$ -subgroups are conjugate in $G$ and the number $n_p$ of Sylow $p$ subgroups must divide $q$ and satisfies $n_p\\equiv 1$ (mod $p$ )). With this taken as given, it is straightforward to prove that $G\\cong P\\rtimes Q$ , where the semidirect product is defined in terms of a homomorphism $\\phi:Q\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(P)$ . We first note that since $|P\\cap Q|$ divides both $p$ and $q$ we must have $|P\\cap Q|=1$ . It follows that $$|PQ|=\\frac{|P||Q|}{|P\\cap Q|}=pq=|G|$$ Hence, $PQ=G$ . Now, since $Q=\\langle y\\rangle$ normalizes $P=\\langle x\\rangle$ , the map $\\phi_k:P\\to P$ given by $\\phi_k(x)=y^kxy^{-k}$ is well defined. Moreover, it is clearly an automorphism with inverse $\\phi_{-k}$ . Finally, since $\\phi_{k}\\phi_j=\\phi_{k+j}$ , the map $y^k\\mapsto\\phi_k$ defines a homomorphism $$\\phi:Q\\to \\mathrm{Aut}(P).$$ As above, we define $P\\rtimes Q$ to be $P\\times Q$ as a set, with multiplication $$(x^i,y^j)(x^k,y^l)=(x^i\\phi_j(x^k),y^{j+k}).$$ Of course, one needs to verify that this is indeed a group. The identity is $(1,1)$ , $(x^k,y^l)^{-1}=(\\phi_{-l}(x^{-k}),y^{-l})$ . Associativity is tedious but true. Define a map $\\psi: P\\rtimes Q\\to G$ by $\\psi(x^i,y^j)=x^iy^j$ . The map $\\psi$ is surjective since $PQ=G$ , and it is injective because $|P\\rtimes Q|=pq=|G|$ . To see that it is a homomorphism we compute \\begin{align*}\n\\psi((x^i,y^j)(x^k,y^l))&=\\psi(x^i\\phi_j(x^k),y^{j+l})\\\\\n&=x^i\\phi_j(x^k)y^{j+l}\\\\\n&=x^i(y^jx^ky^{-j})y^{j+l}\\\\\n&=x^iy^jx^ky^l=\\psi(x^i,y^j)\\psi(x^k,y^l).\n\\end{align*} Hence, $\\psi$ is an isomorphism as promised. Now, either the homomorphism $\\phi:Q\\to\\mathrm{Aut}(P)$ is trivial or it is not. If it is trivial, then $$G\\cong P\\rtimes Q=P\\times Q\\cong C_p\\times C_q\\cong C_{pq}.$$ If the homomorphism is nontrivial, then $G$ has the following presentation: $$G = \\langle x,y\\mid x^p=1=y^q, yx=x^ny\\rangle$$ where $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $n\\not\\equiv1 \\bmod p$ ), but $n^q\\equiv 1 \\bmod p$ ). (To see this note that $yxy^{-1}=x^n$ for some $n\\not\\equiv_p 1$ , but $x=y^qxy^{-q}=x^{n^q}$ .) This works for any pair of primes with $q|(p-1)$ , not just $p=3$ . An example: $p=11$ , $q=5$ . Take $n=3$ so we have $$G=\\langle x,y\\mid x^{11}=1,y^5=1,yx=x^3y\\rangle.$$ This group has order $55$ and you can compute \\begin{align*}\nyxy^{-1}&=x^3\\\\\nyx^3y^{-1}&=(yxy^{-1})^3=x^9\\\\\nyx^{9}y^{-1}&=x^{27}=x^5\\\\\nyx^5y^{-1}&=x^{15}=x^4\\\\\nyx^4y^{-1}&=x^{12}=x\n\\end{align*}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that a group of order pq, where p and q are distinct primes, is cyclic. They mentioned not using Sylow theorems, so we need to approach this with basic group theory concepts.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem states that G is a group of order pq with distinct primes p and q. The user also assumes that G has subgroups H of order p and K of order q. From Lagrange's theorem, since p and q are primes, H and K must be cyclic, isomorphic to Z_p and Z_q respectively. The user is trying to form an internal direct product of H and K to show G is isomorphic to Z_pq, which requires both subgroups to be normal and their intersection trivial.\n\nWait, the user's edit mentions assuming the smaller prime doesn't divide the larger prime minus 1. That probably relates to the automorphism group of the cyclic group. If, say, p < q and p doesn't divide q-1, then there's only the trivial homomorphism from Z_p to Aut(Z_q), forcing the semi-direct product to be direct, hence G is cyclic. But without Sylow, how to handle this?\n\nThe key points are: existence of subgroups, normality of at least one subgroup (maybe if p divides q-1 or not?), and their product covering G. If H and K are both normal, then HK is a subgroup of order pq, so G = HK, and since H ∩ K is trivial, G is the direct product, hence cyclic. But how to show one is normal without Sylow?\n\nAlternatively, by Cauchy's theorem, there are elements of order p and q. Let x be of order p, y of order q. Consider the element xy. If we can show it has order pq, then G is cyclic. The order of xy would be lcm(p,q) if x and y commute, which is pq. So we need to show commutativity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, if one subgroup is normal, say H, then conjugation by elements of G sends H to itself. Then K acts on H by automorphisms. The possible semi-direct products depend on Hom(K, Aut(H)). Since H is cyclic of order p, Aut(H) is cyclic of order p-1. So if q doesn't divide p-1, then only the trivial homomorphism exists, hence the semi-direct product is direct, so G is H×K cyclic. But the user wants to avoid Sylow. Wait, maybe if p and q are distinct, and assuming without loss of generality that p doesn't divide q-1, then the semi-direct product must be trivial. But how to establish the existence of a normal subgroup without Sylow?\n\nMaybe the user's original approach is missing the part where one subgroup must be normal. So the assumptions should include that one of the primes (say p) does not divide q-1, ensuring the semi-direct product is direct. But the original problem statement didn't specify this condition, which might be necessary. The user's edit mentions that maybe assuming the smaller prime doesn't divide the larger minus one. So the problem's correct statement requires that additional condition.\n\nSo the structured problem should include the assumption that, for example, when p < q, p does not divide q-1. Otherwise, the group might not be cyclic. For example, S_3 is order 2*3, but 2 divides 3-1=2, and S_3 is not cyclic. Hence the condition is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the problem's assumptions should include that the group has order pq with distinct primes p and q, and that (assuming p < q) p does not divide q-1. Then, under these conditions, G is cyclic.",
