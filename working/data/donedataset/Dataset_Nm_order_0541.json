    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to 1 of (log²x)/(x² - x + 1) dx equals (10π³)/(81√3). Hmm. First, I need to parse the problem and list the assumptions properly.\n\nThe original problem states the integral I is defined as ∫₀¹ [log²x / (x² - x + 1)] dx and the result is 10π³/(81√3). The user tried rewriting the denominator as 1 - x(1 - x) and considered a substitution y = x(1 - x), but ran into issues handling the log²x term. They also mentioned trying a series expansion and possibly complex methods, noting the roots at x = (-1)^(1/3), which are complex roots of the denominator.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The problem is an integral from 0 to 1. The integrand is (log²x)/(x² - x + 1). So, the variables and functions involved here are x in [0,1], the logarithm squared term, and the quadratic denominator. The integral is definite, so we need to ensure convergence. At x=0, log²x tends to infinity, but the denominator approaches 1 (since x² - x + 1 at x=0 is 0 - 0 +1=1), so the integrand behaves like log²x, which is integrable near 0. Similarly at x=1, denominator becomes 1 -1 +1=1, so no issue there. So the integral is convergent.\n\nThe user's attempt involved substitution y = x(1 - x), but the problem is handling log²x. Changing variables here might complicate the expression because log²x would need to be expressed in terms of y, which might not be straightforward. Alternatively, expanding 1/(1 - x(1 - x)) as a geometric series sum_{n=0}^∞ (x(1 - x))^n. Then interchanging sum and integral. But integrating term-wise would involve integrating x^n (1 - x)^n log²x dx from 0 to1. That seems complicated, but maybe possible using differentiation under the integral sign or some known integrals involving logarithms and polynomials. However, the user said they didn't know how to handle the log²x term in this substitution approach.\n\nAlternatively, complex methods are mentioned. The denominator x² -x +1 factors as (x - ω)(x - ω'), where ω and ω' are complex roots. The roots are at x = [1 ± sqrt(-3)]/2, which are the cube roots of -1, excluding -1 itself. So ω = e^(πi/3) and ω' = e^(-πi/3). So perhaps using contour integration with a keyhole contour around the branch cut at x=0, but integrating from 0 to1. Alternatively, using substitution x = e^{-t} to transform the integral into a form suitable for contour integration. Alternatively, expanding the logarithm in terms of series and integrating term by term.\n\nBut let's structure the problem as per the required format. The user's problem is to prove that the integral equals 10π³/(81√3). The assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is (log²x)/(x² - x +1).\n- The logarithm is the natural logarithm (since it's standard in integrals).\n- The denominator x² -x +1 is non-zero on [0,1], which it is because discriminant is 1 -4 = -3, so roots are complex, hence the denominator is always positive (as x² -x +1 = (x - 0.5)^2 + 0.75 ≥ 0.75).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't add any other conditions. The original user's question doesn't state any other constraints. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is (log²x)/(x² - x + 1),\nThe logarithm is the natural logarithm,\nThe denominator x² - x + 1 is non-zero for all x in [0, 1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\nI := \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\log^2 x}{x^2 - x + 1} \\, dx = \\frac{10\\pi^3}{81 \\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions like n is an integer, n divisible by 7. However, in this problem, the assumptions are inherent to the integral: interval [0,1], integrand form, logarithm natural, and denominator non-vanishing. These are all part of the problem statement. So structuring them line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1}\\),\nThe logarithm function is the natural logarithm,\nThe quadratic denominator \\(x^2 - x + 1\\) has no real roots in the interval [0, 1].\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\nI := \\int_0^1 \\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1} \\, dx = \\frac{10\\pi^3}{81 \\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nWait, but in the original example, they included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the integral's variables and functions don't have parameters, so the assumptions are just about the integral setup. So each assumption line is a separate condition. So for this problem, the assumptions are the integral bounds, the integrand, the type of logarithm, and the denominator's non-vanishing. Each of these can be separate lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the denominator's non-vanishing is not needed as an assumption because it's inherent in the problem. Wait, the problem states the integral as given, so perhaps the only assumptions are the integral's components. The user didn't state any extra conditions, so perhaps the assumptions are simply:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1}\\),\nThe logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nBecause the denominator's non-vanishing is a property that holds true for all real x, so maybe it's not necessary to state. However, if we think that the user might consider that the denominator could have roots, then stating it as an assumption. But since the problem is given as is, perhaps the minimal assumptions are just the integral setup. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had A(n) defined for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but that seems conflicting. Wait, the original example's problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the example is not accurate. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Anyway, perhaps in this current problem, the assumptions are just the integral's setup, as given.\n\nSo, per the example, even if the original problem didn't state an assumption, but the formatted version adds assumptions that are conditions inherent to the problem. For example, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, in this integral problem, the assumptions would be the integral from 0 to1, the integrand as given, and the logarithm is natural. So, structuring as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, 1],\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1}\\),\nThe logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\nI = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1} \\, dx = \\frac{10\\pi^3}{81 \\sqrt{3}}.\n$$\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify the base of the logarithm, but in mathematical contexts, log is usually natural logarithm. However, sometimes in calculus, log can be base e or base 10, but in integration, it's base e. So that's a safe assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line. Each line addresses one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{(\\log x)^2}{x^2 - x + 1}\\),\nThe logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals the given multiple of π³ over sqrt(3).\n\nYes, this seems correct. The denominator's non-vanishing is a property that holds true, so maybe not an assumption but a fact. The user's question doesn't add any other conditions, so the assumptions are just the integral's components.",
