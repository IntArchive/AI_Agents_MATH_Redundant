    "Content": "Consider the equations $$ \n1+\\frac{1}{z^k}=0 \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad 1+\\frac{1}{z^k}+\\frac{1}{(z+1)^k}=0,\n$$ where $k$ is a positive integer $\\ge 4$ . I would like to show for instance that the number of zeros in $\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\lt \\mbox{Arg}(z) \\lt \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is the same for both equations. I'm not sure if this is true, I'm basing this on numerical evidence. Of course the first equation is equivalent to $z^k=-1$ , so all the zeros lie on the unit circle and it is easy to explicitely compute the zeros. The problem is with the second equation, there can be some zeros outside the unit circle, so the condition $\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\lt \\mbox{Arg}(z) \\lt \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is really important here. Intuitively what I think happens is that in this region the term $1/(z+1)^k$ is small for big $k$ , but when $\\mbox{Arg}(z)$ is close to $2\\pi/3$ this is not always the case (in that case $|1/(z+1)^k|\\approx 1$ , so it does contribute to the second equation). Is there a way to get past the issue near $2\\pi/3$ and show that the two equations have the same number of zeros and moreover the solutions are close to each other? (Again this is from numerical evidence)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The two equations don't have the same number of solution in the given sector for every $k$ . Define $(I)$ as equation $z^k+1=0$ and $(II)$ as equation $(1+z^k)(1+z)^k+z^k=0$ . For $k=8$ , numerically $(I)$ has $1$ solutions and $(II)$ has no solutions in sector $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ . If you denote $N_1,N_2$ as the solutions of $(I),(II)$ respectively in the given sector, then for $k\\le 50$ , (all of them are even :o ) $$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\hline \n         k&  N_1& N_2\\\\ \\hline\n         8&  1& 0\\\\ \\hline \n         10&  0& 1\\\\ \\hline \n         14&  1& 0\\\\ \\hline \n         18&  1& 2\\\\ \\hline \n         20&  2& 1\\\\ \\hline \n         32&  3& 2\\\\ \\hline \n         34&  2& 3\\\\ \\hline \n         38&  3& 2\\\\ \\hline \n         42&  3& 4\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$ Now coming to magnitude of the solutions, all solutions to the right of $x=-1/2$ line are indeed close to each other.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem and structure it according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then the problem statement itself.\n\nLooking at the original question on Math Stack Exchange, the user is comparing two equations involving complex numbers and their zeros within a specific argument range. The equations are:\n\n1. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0\\)\n2. \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0\\)\n\nThe goal is to show that the number of zeros in the region \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is the same for both equations, based on numerical evidence. They also mention that \\(k\\) is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.\n\nNow, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. The first equation is equivalent to \\(z^k = -1\\), which means all zeros lie on the unit circle. This is a key point because it tells us about the location of zeros for the first equation.\n2. The second equation might have zeros outside the unit circle, so the argument condition \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is important. This restricts the region where they're comparing zeros.\n3. The term \\(\\frac{1}{(z+1)^k}\\) in the second equation is considered small for large \\(k\\), except when \\(\\text{Arg}(z)\\) is near \\(2\\pi/3\\), where its magnitude might be around 1. This suggests that the contribution of this term varies depending on the argument of \\(z\\).\n4. The user is also assuming (based on numerical evidence) that the number of zeros in the specified region is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other. However, since the problem is to prove this, maybe this isn't an assumption but part of the problem statement. Need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the user says \"I would like to show...\" so that's the problem. The assumptions are the given conditions. Let me list them:\n\n- \\(k\\) is a positive integer, \\(k \\geq 4\\).\n- The first equation is \\(1 + 1/z^k = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(z^k = -1\\).\n- The second equation is \\(1 + 1/z^k + 1/(z+1)^k = 0\\).\n- The region of interest for the argument of \\(z\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n- The term \\(1/(z+1)^k\\) in the second equation can be significant when \\(\\text{Arg}(z)\\) is near \\(2\\pi/3\\), but small otherwise for large \\(k\\).\n\nBut according to the format, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. \\(k\\) is a positive integer.\n2. \\(k \\geq 4\\).\n3. The first equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0\\).\n4. The second equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0\\).\n5. The region of interest is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n6. For the second equation, when \\(\\text{Arg}(z)\\) is near \\(2\\pi/3\\), \\(|1/(z+1)^k| \\approx 1\\).\n7. For large \\(k\\), the term \\(1/(z+1)^k\\) is small in the region \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) except near \\(2\\pi/3\\).\n\nWait, but the user is not necessarily assuming that the term is small except near \\(2\\pi/3\\); they are hypothesizing that this might be the case based on numerical evidence. So maybe points 6 and 7 are part of the problem's context, not assumptions. The actual assumptions are the given conditions of the problem. Let me re-examine the original problem.\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\n- Equations given.\n- \\(k\\) is a positive integer ≥4.\n- Wants to show the number of zeros in the specified region is the same for both equations.\n- Notes that first equation's zeros are on unit circle, second might have some outside.\n- The argument condition is important for the second equation.\n- The term \\(1/(z+1)^k\\) is small in the region except near \\(2\\pi/3\\).\n\nSo the assumptions provided by the problem are:\n\n- \\(k\\) is a positive integer ≥4.\n- The equations are as given.\n- The region of interest is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n\nThe other parts are observations or conjectures based on numerical evidence, which are part of the problem's context but not assumptions. So in the Assumption section, we list the given conditions:\n\nAssumption:\n\n1. \\(k\\) is a positive integer.\n2. \\(k \\geq 4\\).\n3. The first equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0\\).\n4. The second equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0\\).\n5. The region of interest is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n\nThe problem is to show that the number of zeros in that region is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.\n\nWait, but the user also mentions that they want to show the solutions are close. So the problem has two parts: same number of zeros and solutions being close. However, the original problem statement in the user's example only lists the problem as a single statement. Let me check the original example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions (including that n is an integer and divisible by 7) and the problem statement. So the assumptions are the given conditions, not including things that are derived or observations.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- \\(k\\) is a positive integer.\n- \\(k \\geq 4\\).\n- The equations are as given (first and second equation).\n- The region is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n\nThe rest of the original problem's text provides context and observations, but the actual assumptions are those four points. The problem is to show that in that region, both equations have the same number of zeros, and the solutions are close.\n\nBut the user's example had \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections. The problem here is to show two things: same number of zeros and solutions being close. But the user's initial problem statement says \"the number of zeros [...] is the same for both equations\" and \"the solutions are close to each other\".\n\nSo structuring:\n\nProblem: Show that the number of zeros in the region \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.\n\nBut the original example has the problem as a single sentence. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example's problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nHere, the problem is to prove two things: same number of zeros and solutions being close. But perhaps the user would want them both in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the primary problem is the number of zeros, and the closeness is additional.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as Assumption and Problem. So the problem would be as stated by the user: \"show that the number of zeros [...] is the same for both equations. [...] and moreover the solutions are close to each other.\"\n\nSo combining that:\n\nProblem: Show that the number of zeros in \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.\n\nBut to make sure, the original problem says: \"I would like to show for instance that the number of zeros [...] is the same for both equations. [...] show that the two equations have the same number of zeros and moreover the solutions are close to each other?\"\n\nSo the problem is to show two things: same number of zeros and solutions are close. Hence, the Problem part should include both.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \n- \\(k\\) is a positive integer,\n- \\(k \\geq 4\\),\n- The first equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0\\),\n- The second equation is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0\\),\n- The region of interest is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\).\n\nProblem: Show that the number of zeros in \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.\n\nWait, but the original example had each assumption as a single line. So each bullet point is a separate line. Let me adjust the formatting.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$k \\geq 4$,\nthe first equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0$,\nthe second equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0$,\nthe region of interest is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the number of zeros in $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed as separate lines, each starting with a hyphen or bullet point. However, in the example provided by the user, the Assumption section is written with each condition on a separate line, using commas. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example given by the user:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line, each line ending with a comma or period. Each assumption addresses one property applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. $k$ is a positive integer,\n2. $k \\geq 4$,\n3. the first equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0$,\n4. the second equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0$,\n5. the region of interest is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem is to show the number of zeros is the same and solutions are close.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$k$ is a positive integer,\n$k \\geq 4$,\nthe first equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} = 0$,\nthe second equation is $1 + \\frac{1}{z^k} + \\frac{1}{(z+1)^k} = 0$,\nthe region of interest is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nProblem:\nShow that the number of zeros in $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\text{Arg}(z) < \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is the same for both equations and that the solutions are close to each other.",
