    "Content": "As a final exercise to VIII.1 in Algebra: Chapter $0$ , we are asked to prove If $\\mathcal{F}\\colon\\operatorname{R-Mod}\\to\\operatorname{S-Mod}$ is a right-adjoint functor, then $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact. I am having some trouble proving this. If my overall strategy is right, then one necessary step is to show \\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{F}(0)=0,\n\\end{equation} where $0$ is the zero module. However I do not know how to do this. Can someone give a hint? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "As other have stated, there are lots of good properties for adjoint functors. I will just prove your $F(0)=0$ statement. Let $G$ be left adjoint par to $F$. Then for all $S$-modules $X$ and $R$-modules $Y$ we have bijection $Hom_R(GX,Y) \\simeq Hom_S(X,FY)$. Put $Y=0$ and $X=F0$. So we get: $$Hom_S(F0,F0) \\simeq  Hom_R(GF0,0) \\simeq \\{0\\}.$$ Now, if $F0\\neq 0$, then there would be at least two different S-module-homomorphisms $F0 \\to F0$ (namely, identity and zero-homomorphism), which would be a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that a right-adjoint functor between module categories is left-exact. The user is specifically stuck on showing that the functor F applied to the zero module yields the zero module.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions that F is a right-adjoint functor from R-Mod to S-Mod. So the first assumption is that F is a right-adjoint. Then, the problem is set in the context of module categories, so R-Mod and S-Mod are the categories involved. The user is working with modules over rings R and S, so those are the respective rings. The task is to prove left-exactness, which typically involves preserving finite limits, or in module terms, preserving kernels of morphisms. However, the user is specifically stuck on proving F(0) = 0. \n\nSo the assumptions should break down each property. Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object. The main objects here are the functor F, the categories R-Mod and S-Mod. The key conditions are that F is a right-adjoint, and the context of module categories. Also, the problem involves the zero module, but maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the problem statement is to prove that F is left-exact, which includes F(0)=0 as a part. But the user is focusing on that specific step. So in the problem statement, the main thing to prove is that F is left-exact, given that it's a right-adjoint. But the user is stuck on a specific part of that proof. However, the original problem as presented in the question is to prove that right-adjoint functors are left-exact. The example given in the user's example didn't include all assumptions from the original problem but focused on the ones relevant. For instance, in the example, the original problem had an integer n, but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might not be in the original. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that example was a bad example. Because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example is a different problem. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n doesn't have to be divisible by 7. However, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the user is breaking the problem into two parts: divisible by 7 and 13. But the example's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That might be a mistake in the example. So perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated? That's confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the example is a different scenario. Let me focus back on the current problem. The current problem is about right-adjoint functors being left-exact. The question is from Algebra: Chapter 0, exercise VIII.1. The user is stuck on proving F(0)=0. The original problem asks to prove that if F: R-Mod → S-Mod is a right-adjoint functor, then F is left-exact. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- F is a right-adjoint functor.\n\n- F is a functor between the categories R-Mod and S-Mod.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that F is left-exact. However, in the formatted example, the user added assumptions that were not present in the original problem. Wait, in their example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user wants to split the problem into parts, or perhaps the example was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. Wait, maybe in the original problem, n being an integer is given, and then the formatted problem lists that as an assumption. Then, in the example, the problem is to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. Perhaps the formatted problem is a step where they assume n is divisible by 7, and then separately by 13. But the example's original problem didn't specify that. So perhaps the example is part of an induction step or something. \n\nBut for the current problem, the user's question is about proving that a right-adjoint functor is left-exact. The key assumptions are that F is right-adjoint, between R-Mod and S-Mod. The problem is to prove F is left-exact, which includes F(0)=0, preserving zero, and preserving kernels. \n\nSo, following the example's structure, which seems to list all relevant assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem says \"If F: R-Mod → S-Mod is a right-adjoint functor, then F is left-exact.\" So the assumptions would be:\n\n- F is a functor from R-Mod to S-Mod.\n\n- F is a right-adjoint functor.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that F is left-exact.\n\nBut the user is specifically stuck on showing F(0)=0. But according to the instructions, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given included assumptions, even if they were part of the problem statement. So in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, we need to list the assumptions given in the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem: If F is a right-adjoint functor from R-Mod to S-Mod, then prove F is left-exact.\n\nSo assumptions:\n\n- F is a functor.\n\n- The domain of F is R-Mod.\n\n- The codomain of F is S-Mod.\n\n- F is a right-adjoint functor.\n\nProblem: Prove that F is left-exact.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about showing F(0)=0. However, the problem as a whole is to prove left-exactness. The user is working on a step in that proof, but the overall problem is to prove left-exactness. So according to the instructions, we need to structure the original problem as per the user's example. In their example, they restated the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem listed n is an integer, n is divisible by 7 (which might be part of the solution strategy?), but that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions should include all given conditions in the problem, not introducing new ones. So if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". In the current problem, the original problem states \"F is a right-adjoint functor from R-Mod to S-Mod\", so the assumptions should be:\n\n- F is a right-adjoint functor.\n\n- F has domain category R-Mod.\n\n- F has codomain category S-Mod.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that F is left-exact.\n\nBut in the example, they split into two lines: \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example problem, n was just any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Unless the user wanted to factor 91 into 7 and 13, and split the problem into two parts, each requiring divisibility by 7 and 13. But in that case, the formatted problem's assumption would be part of the solution step, not the original problem's assumptions. So perhaps the example is not a good one. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. \n\nIn any case, for the current problem, we need to extract the assumptions from the original problem. The original problem states: \"If $\\mathcal{F}\\colon\\operatorname{R-Mod}\\to\\operatorname{S-Mod}$ is a right-adjoint functor, then $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. $\\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from R-Mod to S-Mod.\n\n2. $\\mathcal{F}$ is a right-adjoint.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\n- The functor $\\mathcal{F}$ is from R-Mod to S-Mod.\n\n- The functor $\\mathcal{F}$ is a right-adjoint.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove left-exactness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"R-Mod is the category of R-modules\" and \"S-Mod is the category of S-modules\" are also assumptions, but those are standard definitions. However, since the problem mentions them, perhaps we should include them as assumptions. But the original problem states \"R-Mod\" and \"S-Mod\" as categories, so maybe we can assume the reader knows those are module categories. But to follow the example, maybe the assumptions should include:\n\n- R-Mod is the category of modules over ring R.\n\n- S-Mod is the category of modules over ring S.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify that R and S are rings, but given the context of modules, it's implied. However, since the example didn't include such implicit assumptions, maybe it's better to list explicit ones. \n\nBut the original problem as stated in the user's question is: \"If $\\mathcal{F}\\colon\\operatorname{R-Mod}\\to\\operatorname{S-Mod}$ is a right-adjoint functor, then $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact.\"\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ is a functor between R-Mod and S-Mod.\n\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ is a right-adjoint.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption: $\\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from R-Mod to S-Mod,\n\nAssumption: $\\mathcal{F}$ is a right-adjoint functor,\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is from Algebra: Chapter 0, and the user is working on VIII.1, the categories R-Mod and S-Mod are abelian categories, so left-exactness is defined in that context. However, I think the key points are the two assumptions above.\n\nThe user is stuck on proving $\\mathcal{F}(0) = 0$, which is part of showing left-exactness, as left-exact functors preserve finite limits, including kernels, which includes preserving the zero object. But in abelian categories, a left-exact functor is one that preserves kernels, which includes preserving the zero map. However, the exact definition might vary. \n\nIn any case, according to the user's instructions, the task is to format the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: $\\mathcal{F}$ is a functor from R-Mod to S-Mod,\n\nAssumption: $\\mathcal{F}$ is a right-adjoint,\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\mathcal{F}$ is left-exact.\n\nBut in the example, they added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For instance, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect, but perhaps the example was a mistake. Therefore, in this case, we should follow the original problem's explicit assumptions. The problem states that F is a right-adjoint functor between R-Mod and S-Mod, so those are the two assumptions. Then the problem is to prove left-exactness.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about proving F(0)=0, which is a step in proving left-exactness. However, the main problem is to prove left-exactness. So the formatted problem should reflect the main task, not the specific step the user is stuck on. Therefore, the correct formatting would be as follows.",
