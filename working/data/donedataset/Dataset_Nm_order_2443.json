    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not sure if the following fits the requirement to avoid finding the limit, but anyway... Consider the change of variable $$x_n=c_n-\\frac{r}{c_n}$$ then $$x_{n+1}=-f(c_n)x_n$$ with $$f(c)=\\frac{(r-1)c}{(c+1)(c+r)}$$ Now, for every $c>0$, \n$$(c+1)(c+r)\\geqslant(r+1)c$$ hence $$f(c)\\leqslant s$$ with $$s=\\frac{r-1}{r+1}<1$$ Thus, $$|x_n|\\leqslant s^{n-1}\\cdot|x_1|$$ which implies that $$x_n\\to0$$ hence $$c_n\\to\\text{____}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions mentioned in the original problem. Let me read through the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about two integer sequences {a_n} and {b_n} with initial conditions a_1 = b_1 = 1. The recurrence relations are given as:\na_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}\nb_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}\nwhere r is a natural number greater than 1. Then, c_n = b_n / a_n, and they want to prove that the limit of c_n as n approaches infinity exists without actually finding the limit.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. {a_n} and {b_n} are integer sequences.\n2. The initial terms a_1 and b_1 are both 1.\n3. The recurrence relation for a_n: a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n4. The recurrence relation for b_n: b_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n5. r is a natural number (so r is an integer greater than or equal to 1).\n6. But the problem states r is a natural number >1, so r is fixed and greater than 1.\n7. The goal is to prove the limit of c_n = b_n / a_n exists as n approaches infinity.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that they tried to use induction to show that {c_{2n}} is decreasing and {c_{2n+1}} is increasing, and that 0 < c_n < r. So maybe the bounded and monotonic nature of the subsequences is part of their approach, but those are their attempts, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's own conditions are the ones given in the problem statement.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object:\n\n- The first sequence {a_n} is defined with a_1 = 1.\n- The second sequence {b_n} is defined with b_1 = 1.\n- For n ≥ 2, a_n is defined recursively as a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n- For n ≥ 2, b_n is defined recursively as r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n- r is a natural number (i.e., positive integer).\n- r is greater than 1.\n- The limit in question is for the sequence c_n = b_n / a_n as n approaches infinity.\n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. Let me check the example again. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on a separate line. So here, each condition should be split similarly.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of c_n as n approaches infinity exists without finding the limit.\n\nNow, let me verify if I missed any assumptions. The original problem mentions that the sequences are integer sequences, so that's another assumption. So:\n\n- {a_n} is an integer sequence.\n- {b_n} is an integer sequence.\n\nBut wait, the initial terms are 1, and since r is a natural number, the recursion would indeed keep the sequences as integers. But the problem states that they are integer sequences, so that's a given condition. Therefore, these should be included as separate assumptions.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- a_1 = 1\n- b_1 = 1\n- For each n > 1, a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}\n- For each n > 1, b_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}\n- r is a natural number\n- r > 1\n- {a_n} is an integer sequence\n- {b_n} is an integer sequence\n\nWait, but the fact that they are integer sequences might be a consequence of the initial conditions and the recurrence relations with r being natural. But the problem states \"two integer sequences such that...\", so it's given that they are integer sequences. Therefore, this is an assumption. So including that as separate lines.\n\nHowever, in the original problem, the user wrote \"two integer sequences such that...\", so that is a condition. So we have to list that {a_n} and {b_n} are integer sequences as separate assumptions.\n\nSo each assumption line by line:\n\n1. {a_n} is an integer sequence.\n2. {b_n} is an integer sequence.\n3. a_1 = 1.\n4. b_1 = 1.\n5. For each integer n > 1, a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n6. For each integer n > 1, b_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n7. r is a natural number.\n8. r > 1.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user wrote \"Where r is a natural number >1. (r is a fixed value)\". So maybe r being fixed is another assumption. But \"fixed value\" is part of the problem's setup, so perhaps we can consider that as well. However, the key assumptions are the ones given in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says \"r is a natural number >1\" and \"r is a fixed value\", perhaps we can combine the natural number and r >1 into one line. But the example splits different properties into separate lines, even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate, even though both apply to n. So here, \"r is a natural number\" and \"r >1\" should be separate.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- {a_n} is an integer sequence.\n- {b_n} is an integer sequence.\n- a_1 = 1.\n- b_1 = 1.\n- For each integer n > 1, a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n- For each integer n > 1, b_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}.\n- r is a natural number.\n- r > 1.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that the limit of c_n = b_n / a_n as n approaches infinity exists without finding the limit.\n\nSo putting this into the required format:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n{a_n} is an integer sequence,\n{b_n} is an integer sequence,\na_1 = 1,\nb_1 = 1,\nFor each integer n > 1, a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1},\nFor each integer n > 1, b_n = r * a_{n-1} + b_{n-1},\nr is a natural number,\nr > 1.\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} c_n$$ exists without finding its value, where $c_n = \\dfrac{b_n}{a_n}$.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nWait, in the original example, the problem line included the expression formatted with $$. Also, in the original question, they wrote c_n = b_n / a_n, so we should include that definition in the problem statement. The problem statement is to prove the limit exists, without finding it. So the problem line should state that c_n is defined as b_n over a_n, and the limit of c_n as n approaches infinity exists.\n\nBut in the example, they included the expression for A(n). So here, we need to include the definition of c_n in the problem statement. So:\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} c_n$$ exists without finding its value, where $$c_n = \\dfrac{b_n}{a_n}$$.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions \"Write c_n = b_n / a_n\", but in the formatted problem, the definition should be included in the problem line. Therefore, the problem line should include the definition of c_n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should read:\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} c_n$$ exists without finding it, where $$c_n = \\dfrac{b_n}{a_n}$$.\n\nThis seems correct. Let me check if all assumptions are covered. The problem states the sequences are integer, initial terms, recursion relations, r is natural and >1. Yes. Each assumption is listed separately.\n\nAnother check: in the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each property is separate. Similarly here, each property for the sequences, initial terms, recursion relations, r's properties are separate lines. This seems to align with the example.",
