    "Content": "In trying to understand a result of D. Rider (Trans. AMS, 1973) I've got stuck on a lemma that he uses. At one point he makes a step without comment or explanation, but I can't see why it works. Here is a paraphrase of what I think he is claiming. Let $d_1,\\dots, d_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $1$; let $b_1,\\dots, b_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $\\leq 1$. (In the intended application the numbers $b_1,\\dots, b_n$ are actually the diagonal entries of a unitary $n\\times n$ matrix, but I strongly suspect that is not used in the argument.)\nThen Rider seems to assert, without further comment, that\n$$ \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_jb_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2}\n\\leq \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} +  \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (b_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2}\n$$ Probably I am just being dense, and have failed to spot a routine estimate that does the job. If anyone could get me started on the right track that would be most helpful, as this is starting to get very irritating, and is not even the main part of Rider's argument. Update Firstly, thanks to everyone who answered, but in particular to Will Jagy for various off-MSE exchanges, and to George Lowther for his elegant argument (the key part that I had failed to think of, was the use of $\\rm Re$ and its linearity rather than $\\vert\\cdot\\vert$ and its sub-additivity, allowing one to boost up the observation made by Gerry Myerson). In case it's of interest, here are some more details on how the question I asked corresponds to Lemma 5.1 in Rider's paper. The paper is dealing with central trigonometric polynomials on compact groups, which means: linear combinations of traces of irreducible representations. Paraphrased lightly, and with a fairly trivial reduction step thrown in, the aforementioned lemma says the following: Let $\\phi: G \\to U(n)$ be an (irreducible) unitary representation of a (compact) group $G$. If $$\\vert n^{-1}\\operatorname{\\rm Tr}\\phi(g_i)-z_i\\vert \\leq \\delta_i \\qquad(i=1,\\dots, p)$$\n  where $\\vert z_i\\vert=1$ for all $i$, then\n  $$ \\left\\vert n^{-1}\\operatorname{Tr}\\phi(g_1\\dotsb g_n) - \\prod_{i=1}^p z_i \\right\\vert \\leq \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^p \\delta_i^{1/2}\\right)^2 $$ The proof given in the paper goes as follows: reduce to the case $p=2$ (if this can be done then induction will do the rest); then observe that WLOG $\\phi(g_1)$ is a diagonal unitary matrix, w.r.t. an appropriate basis. If we let $d_1,\\dots, d_n$ be the diagonal entries of $\\phi(g_1)$ and $b_1,\\dots, b_n$ be those of $\\phi(g_2)$, then the trace of $\\phi(g_1g_2)$ is just $\\sum_{i=1}^n d_ib_i$, and so we have to prove Claim. If $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$, $\\left\\vert\\sum_{i=1}^n (d_i - z_1)\\right\\vert\\leq n\\delta_1$, and\n   $\\left\\vert\\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - z_2)\\right\\vert\\leq n\\delta_2$, then\n  $$\\left\\vert \\sum_{i=1}^n (d_ib_i - z_1z_2) \\right\\vert \\leq n(\\delta_1^{1/2}+\\delta_2^{1/2})^2. $$ This is where Rider is content to say \"done\"; and it is hopefully clear that this is equivalent to my original question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes, the result holds. First, for any complex number $z$ with $\\vert z\\vert\\le1$, we have\n$$\n2\\Re(1-z)=1-\\vert z\\vert^2+\\vert z-1\\vert^2\\ge\\vert z-1\\vert^2.\n$$\nIt follows that if $Z$ is a complex random variable with $\\vert Z\\vert\\le1$ then,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\vert Z-1\\right\\vert^2\\right]\\le2\\Re\\left(\\mathbb{E}\\left[1-Z\\right]\\right)\\le2\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z-1\\right]\\right\\vert.\n$$\nTherefore, if $X,Y$ are complex random variables with $\\vert X\\vert\\le1$ and $\\vert Y\\vert\\le1$ then, using Cauchy–Schwarz,\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X-1)(Y-1)\\right]\\right\\vert^2&\\le\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\vert  X-1\\right\\vert^2\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left\\vert Y-1\\right\\vert^2\\right]\\cr\n&\\le4\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[X-1\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y-1\\right]\\right\\vert\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSo, using the identity $XY-1=(X-1)+(Y-1)+(X-1)(Y-1)$ (as in Gerry Myerson's answer),\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[XY-1\\right]\\right\\vert&\\le\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[X-1\\right]\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y-1\\right]\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[(X-1)(Y-1)\\right]\\right\\vert\\cr\n&\\le\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[X-1\\right]\\right\\vert+\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y-1\\right]\\right\\vert+2\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[X-1\\right]\\mathbb{E}\\left[Y-1\\right]\\right\\vert^{1/2}\\cr\n&=\\left(\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}[X-1]\\right\\vert^{1/2}+\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}[Y-1]\\right\\vert^{1/2}\\right)^2.\n\\end{align}\n$$\nTake the square root of each side to obtain\n$$\n\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}\\left[XY-1\\right]\\right\\vert^{1/2}\\le\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}[X-1]\\right\\vert^{1/2}+\\left\\vert\\mathbb{E}[Y-1]\\right\\vert^{1/2},\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to the inequality in the question.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor who can read a question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out the unrelated information, and present it in the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through the original question carefully. The user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement from a problem about divisibility. Now, the task is to do the same for the given Math Stack Exchange question about Rider's lemma and the inequality involving complex numbers.\n\nThe original question is titled \"A sub-additivity inequality\" and the user is confused about a step in Rider's paper. The problem involves complex numbers d_j and b_j with certain modulus conditions. The goal is to prove an inequality involving the sums of (d_j b_j -1), (d_j -1), and (b_j -1). There's a lot of context given about the paper, the application to unitary matrices, and some updates where the user discusses the solution. But the key part is the inequality assertion.\n\nI need to filter out the unnecessary details. The assumptions should list each condition line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be the core inequality to prove.\n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\n1. The complex numbers d_1, ..., d_n have modulus 1. So each |d_j| = 1.\n2. The complex numbers b_1, ..., b_n have modulus ≤ 1. So each |b_j| ≤ 1.\n3. The problem is to prove the inequality involving the sums of (d_j b_j -1), (d_j -1), and (b_j -1). Specifically, the square root of the absolute value of the sum of (d_j b_j -1) is less than or equal to the sum of the square roots of the absolute values of the sums of (d_j -1) and (b_j -1).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, Rider asserts:\n\n$$ \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_jb_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} \\leq \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} +  \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (b_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} $$\n\nSo the problem is to prove this inequality given the conditions on d_j and b_j.\n\nNow, the assumptions are:\n\n- Each d_j is a complex number with modulus 1.\n- Each b_j is a complex number with modulus ≤ 1.\n- The problem is to prove the inequality as stated.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user mentions that in the application, the b_j are diagonal entries of a unitary matrix, but they think that's not used here. So the key assumptions are just that |d_j|=1 and |b_j| ≤1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- For each j, d_j is a complex number with modulus 1.\n- For each j, b_j is a complex number with modulus ≤ 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to each object (each d_j and each b_j).\n\nThe problem is then to prove the inequality as given.\n\nI need to check if there are any other hidden assumptions. The problem statement doesn't mention anything else. The original context talks about unitary matrices, but the user says that's not used here. So I don't need to include that in the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach $d_j$ is a complex number with modulus 1,\nEach $b_j$ is a complex number with modulus ≤ 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$ \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_jb_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} \\leq \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (d_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} +  \\left\\vert\\sum_{j=1}^n (b_j-1)\\right\\vert^{1/2} $$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user might have more conditions? Let me check again.\n\nThe original problem says: \"Let $d_1,\\dots, d_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $1$; let $b_1,\\dots, b_n$ be complex numbers of modulus $\\leq 1$.\" So yes, that's the key. The problem is to prove that inequality with those conditions.\n\nSo the answer should list those two assumptions, each on their own line, and then the problem statement.",
