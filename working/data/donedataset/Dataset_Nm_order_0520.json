    "Content": "I can't seem to find any references that gives a proof of the Gauss-Green theorem : Let $U\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be an open, bounded set with $\\partial U$ being $C^1$ . Suppose $u\\in C^{1}(\\bar{U})$ , then $$\\int_{U}{\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i}}dx=\\int_{\\partial U}u\\nu^{i}dS\\;\\;\\;\\;(i=1,\\ldots,n),$$ where $\\nu=(\\nu^1,\\ldots\\nu^n)$ denotes the outward-pointing unit normal vector field to the region $U$ . Evans' PDE textbook presents the theorem (with no proof) in the appendix, and proceeds to use it to derive Green's formulas and the formula for $n$ -dimensional integration by parts. So I'd really like to have a proof of the theorem for future reference.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an analytic proof not using differential forms. Restricted to $n=3$, it comes almost verbatim from Stewart, Calculus: Early Transcendentals. To get started, let us naively assume that region $U$ is convex. The reason for us to make the seemingly too-much assumption is that we want to give a description of $U$ in terms of a single two sided inequality (in the form $a\\leq x_i\\leq b$) for each $i$. Let $D$ be the projection of $U$ onto the $x_1x_2\\cdots\\hat{x_i}\\cdots x_n$ hyperplane (to avoid confusion, $\\hat{}$ means the variable under it is absent). Due to the convexity of $U$, we can write $U=\\{(x_1,\\cdots,x_n)\\in \\mathbf{R}^n|(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)\\in D\\mbox{ and } f_1\\leq x_i \\leq f_2\\}$ for some $\\mathbf{R}^{n-1}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ functions $f_1(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)$ and $f_2(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)$. Here $f_1$ and $f_2$ are $C^1$ by the definition of $\\partial U$ being $C^1$(see the appendix in Evans). Remember we want to prove $$\\int_U\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i}dx=\\int_{\\partial U}u\\nu^idS.$$ The description of $U$ above allows us to write the LHS as an iterated integral $$\\int_D\\left(\\int_{f_1(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)}^{f_2(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_i}dx_i\\right)dA,$$ where $dA=dx_1\\cdots\\hat{dx_i}\\cdots dx_n$. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to the inner integral, we then have $$\\int_Du(x_1,\\cdots,f_2(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n),\\cdots,x_n)-u(x_1,\\cdots,f_1(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n)\\cdots,x_n)dA.$$ This is all we can do to the LHS now. For the RHS, notice that $\\partial U$ can be decomposed into three surfaces $S_2$, $S_3$ and $S_{1}$ where $\\nu^i$ at all the points of  $S_2$ are positive, $\\nu^i$ at all the points of $S_3$ are zero ($S_3$ is parallel to the $x_i$ axis) and $\\nu^i$ of $S_1$ are negative. Thus, RHS is $$\\int_{S_2}u\\nu^idS+\\int_{S_3}u\\nu^idS+\\int_{S_1}u\\nu^idS.$$ Since $\\nu_i$ for $S_3$ is zero, only the first and last term keep. From the geometric picture described at the beginning, the projection of $S_1$ and $S_2$ onto the $x_1x_2\\cdots\\hat{x_i}\\cdots x_n$ hyperplane are exactly $D$. Also keep in mind that $\\nu^i$ is the direction cosine of $\\nu$ with the $x_i$ axis in $\\mathbf{R}^n$. Therefore, $$\\int_{S_2}u\\nu^idS=\\int_Du(x_1,\\cdots,f_2(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n),\\cdots,x_n)d\nA,$$\nand $$\\int_{S_1}u\\nu^idS=-\\int_Du(x_1,\\cdots,f_1(x_1,\\cdots,\\hat{x_i},\\cdots,x_n),\\cdots,x_n)dA.$$ This proves the theorem when $U$ is convex. For general $C^1$ $U$, I am thinking to cut the region into convex chunks so that when we glue them together the surface integral over touching faces are just cancelled due to opposite normal directions. Of course, I hope occasional \"non-smoothie\" won't introduce too much trouble.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving the Gauss-Green Theorem as stated in Evans' PDE book. The user wants the assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the theorem statement. The theorem is set in U, a subset of R^n. The conditions on U are that it's open, bounded, and its boundary is C^1. Then, the function u is in C^1(closure of U). The integral equation involves the partial derivative of u with respect to x_i, integrating over U, and the integral over the boundary involving u times the i-th component of the outward normal vector.\n\nSo breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. U is an open subset of R^n. That's one condition on U.\n2. U is bounded. That's another condition on the same object, U.\n3. The boundary of U, denoted ∂U, is of class C^1. That's a third condition on U (or specifically its boundary).\n4. The function u is in C^1(closure of U). So u is once continuously differentiable on the closure of U. That's a condition on u.\n5. The equation involves the integral over U of the partial derivative of u with respect to x_i, and the integral over ∂U of u times the i-th component of the outward unit normal vector ν. The problem is to prove this equality for each i from 1 to n.\n\nWait, the user's example included even the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but in the original problem here, the theorem statement includes all the necessary assumptions. The problem is to prove the integral formula given those conditions on U and u. So I need to list each assumption separately. Each assumption should be a single line, each applying to one object. So U has three conditions: open, bounded, C^1 boundary. Then u is in C^1(closure of U). The normal vector ν is the outward-pointing unit normal. So maybe that's another assumption about ν. But in the theorem statement, ν is defined as the outward normal, so perhaps that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. Wait, the problem is to prove that given U satisfies these conditions and u is in C^1(closure of U), then the integral equation holds with ν being the outward normal. So the assumptions are on U and u. The existence of ν as the outward normal is a consequence of U having a C^1 boundary, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the theorem's conclusion. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions. So each line is a separate condition, even if they apply to the same object. So for U, the three conditions: open, bounded, and ∂U is C^1. Each on separate lines. Then u is in C^1(closure of U). So four assumptions in total. Then the problem is to prove the integral equation with ν as the outward normal. So the problem statement includes the equation, and the assumptions are the four points. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: Let U⊂ℝⁿ be open, bounded with ∂U being C¹. Suppose u∈C¹(closure(U)). Then the integral equation holds. So the assumptions are:\n\n- U is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\n- U is bounded.\n\n- ∂U is of class C¹.\n\n- u is in C¹(closure(U)).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each on U or u. So four assumptions. The problem is to prove the integral equation. The outward normal vector is part of the statement, but not an assumption—it's defined as part of the theorem's conclusion. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those four assumptions, each on their own line, and the problem is to prove the integral equation.",
