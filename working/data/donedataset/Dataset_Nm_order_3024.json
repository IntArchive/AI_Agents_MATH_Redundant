    "AcceptedAnswer": "When triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is acute, the circumcenter $O$ is the point that maximize the minimal distance. Let $R = |OA| = |OB| = |OC|$ be the circumradius. Let $A', B', C'$ be the mid-points of sides $BC$ , $CA$ and $AB$ respectively. Draw six lines segments from $O$ to $A,B,C, A',B',C'$ . They will divide triangle $ABC$ into six right angled triangles $\\triangle OAC'$ , $\\triangle OC'B$ , $\\triangle OBA'$ , $\\triangle OA'C$ , $\\triangle OCB'$ and $\\triangle OB'A$ . Consider the two triangle $\\triangle OAC'$ and $\\triangle OB'A$ which are sharing the segment $OA$ . Since $\\angle AC'O = \\angle OB'A = 90^\\circ$ , both triangles lie completely inside the circle with $OA$ as diameter (the green circle in above diagram). Since this circle is lying within the circle with $A$ as center passing through $O$ (the blue circle), every point $P$ belongs to triangle $\\triangle OAC'$ and $\\triangle OB'A$ satisfies $$|PA| \\le |OA| = R\n\\quad\\implies\\quad \\min(|PA|, |PB|, |PC|) \\le R$$ Similar thing happen to the two pairs of triangles $\\triangle OC'B, \\triangle OBA'$ and $\\triangle OA'C, \\triangle OCB'$ . From this, we can conclude $$\\min(|PA|,|PB|,|PC|) \\le R\\quad\\text{ for all points } P \\text{ in triangle }ABC$$ When $P = O$ , above inequality becomes an equality. This implies $$\\max_{P \\in \\triangle ABC}\\left(\\min(|PA|,|PB|,|PC|)\\right) = R$$ and $O$ is the point that maximize the minimal distance. Update Let us switch to case where triangle $ABC$ is obtuse. WOLOG, we will assume $a = |BC| > b = |CA| \\ge c = |AB|$ . Construct the perpendicular bisector of side $CA$ , let it intersect $BC$ at $B''$ . Construct the perpendicular bisector of side $AB$ , let it intersect $BC$ at $C''$ . These two perpendicular bisectors split $\\triangle ABC$ into 3 regions, two triangles $\\triangle BC''B$ (the red one), $\\triangle CB'B''$ (the green one) and a pentagon $AC'C''B''B'$ (the blue one). For any $P$ inside $\\triangle ABC$ , it is easy to see: $$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nP \\in \\triangle BC''B & \\implies   & |PB| \\le |PA|,|PC|\\\\\nP \\in AC'C''B''B' & \\implies & |PA| \\le |PB|, |PC|\\\\\nP \\in \\triangle CB'B'' & \\implies & |PC| \\le |PA|, |PB\n\\end{array}\n$$ Since the distance functions $|PA|$ , $|PB|$ , $|PC|$ are convex, their maximum will be achieved at the vertices. Since both $\\triangle BC''C'$ and $\\triangle CB'B''$ are right angled triangles,\nwe have $|BC''| > |BC'|$ and $|CB''| > |CB'|$ . Together with the obvious equalities, $|AC'| = |BC'|$ , $|AC''| = |BC''|$ , $|AB'| = |CB'|$ , $|AB''| = |AB''|$ , there are only two possiblities. The maximum minimum distance\nis either achieved at $B''$ with value $|AB''| = |CB''| = \\frac{b}{2\\cos\\gamma}$ or achieved at $C''$ with value $|AC''| = |BC''| = \\frac{c}{2\\cos\\beta}$ . where $\\beta = \\angle C'BC''$ and $\\gamma = B''CB'$ . Using sine rule, we have $$|CB''| : |BC''| = \\frac{b}{2\\cos\\gamma} : \\frac{c}{2\\cos\\beta} = \\sin(2\\beta) : \\sin(2\\gamma)$$ Since $\\triangle ABC$ is obtuse, both $\\beta,\\gamma \\in \\left(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ and hence $$b \\ge c \\iff \\sin \\beta \\ge \\sin\\gamma \\implies \\beta \\ge \\gamma$$ It is impossible for $\\sin(2\\beta) < \\sin(2\\gamma)$ or that will force $2\\beta > \\pi - 2\\gamma \\iff \\beta + \\gamma \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ which contradicts with the condition $\\triangle ABC$ is obtuse. As a result, $$|CB''| \\ge |BC''|$$ This confirms Joe Knapp's conjecture. The maxmium minimum distance is achieved at $B''$ , the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of the second longest side with the longest side. Using the relation $c = 2R\\sin\\gamma$ , one find the maximum minimal distance\nequals to $\\displaystyle\\;\\frac{bR}{\\sqrt{4 R^2-c^2}}\\;$ in this case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find the point inside a triangle that's farthest from any vertex, maximizing the minimum distance to each vertex. Their initial thought is that it's the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles, but they can't prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let's parse the original question.\n\nOriginal Question:\n\"Given a triangle with vertices V1, V2, and V3, what is the point inside the triangle that is farthest away from any vertex (i.e., the point which maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex). My first thought is that it is the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles, but I can't seem to prove this.\"\n\nAssumptions:\n- The problem is about a triangle, so we can assume it's a planar triangle in Euclidean geometry.\n- The triangle has three vertices: V1, V2, V3.\n- The point in question is inside the triangle.\n- The goal is to find the point that maximizes the minimum distance to all three vertices. That is, for any point P inside the triangle, compute min{d(P,V1), d(P,V2), d(P,V3)}, and find the P that makes this minimum as large as possible.\n\nWait, the user's initial thought involves different points based on whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. So perhaps the type of triangle (acute, obtuse) is a condition here. However, in the problem statement as given, the user is asking for the point for any triangle. But their hypothesis splits it into two cases: acute vs. obtuse. Therefore, the problem might implicitly assume that the triangle can be either acute or obtuse, and the solution depends on that. But the original problem statement as presented doesn't specify the triangle's type; it's a general triangle. So the assumptions here might be:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse.\n- The point must be inside the triangle.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Given a triangle...\", so perhaps the triangle can be any type. However, the user's conjecture splits into cases based on the triangle's type. Therefore, the problem is to determine this point depending on whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. Hence, the assumptions should include that the triangle can be classified as acute or obtuse, and the solution varies accordingly. But in the problem statement, there's no explicit assumption given; it's just a general triangle. Therefore, when structuring, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a planar triangle with vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point must be inside the triangle.\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse (since the user's conjecture depends on that).\n\nBut wait, does the problem mention acute or obtuse in the original question? The user's thought process does, but the actual problem statement is just \"given a triangle\". However, the user's hypothesis splits into these cases, so perhaps the problem requires considering these cases. Therefore, the problem is to find the point for any triangle, which would involve handling both acute and obtuse cases. So in the formatted problem, maybe the assumptions would include that the triangle can be acute or obtuse, and the solution depends on that. But in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions applied to one object. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, the original problem had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. Maybe that example was a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in their example. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That would actually restrict the problem, which seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong. But perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions, but maybe the original problem had a different condition. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. Regardless, perhaps the example is not to be emulated exactly but rather the structure.\n\nBack to the current problem. The original problem is to find the point inside a triangle that maximizes the minimal distance to the vertices. The user's thought is that it's the circumcenter for acute and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse. The problem is to prove this.\n\nSo assumptions here would be:\n\n- The triangle is planar (Euclidean).\n- The triangle has three vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point is inside the triangle.\n- For acute triangles, the point is the circumcenter.\n- For obtuse triangles, the point is the midpoint of the longest edge.\n\nWait, no. The user's conjecture is that the point is the circumcenter for acute and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse. But the problem is to prove that this is the case. So the assumptions are:\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that the farthest point is either the circumcenter or the midpoint depending on the triangle type. Therefore, the assumptions would be the properties of acute and obtuse triangles, and the location of the circumcenter.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented as a general problem without prior assumptions, so the formatted problem's assumptions would list the conditions on the triangle (being acute or obtuse) as part of the problem's cases. However, in the example provided, the assumption included a condition (n is divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption added that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Maybe that example is not a good one. Perhaps the user made a mistake there. Therefore, maybe in this current problem, the assumptions should include the triangle being acute or obtuse, but how to phrase it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured without explicit assumptions, but the problem statement includes the cases. However, the user's problem is to prove that the point is as conjectured. So perhaps the formatted problem should state:\n\nProblem: Prove that for a triangle, the point inside it that maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex is the circumcenter if the triangle is acute, and the midpoint of the longest edge if the triangle is obtuse.\n\nBut then the assumptions would be:\n\n- The triangle is acute or obtuse.\n- The point is inside the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about any triangle, but the solution depends on its type, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a planar triangle with vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point must lie inside the triangle.\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't restrict to acute or obtuse; it's any triangle. However, the user's conjecture splits into these cases. Therefore, the problem is to determine the point for any triangle, considering both cases. Hence, the problem statement in the formatted version would be:\n\nProblem: For a given triangle, determine the point inside it that is farthest from any vertex (i.e., maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex). Prove that this point is the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify proving for both cases; the user is conjecturing that and wants to prove it. So the problem as presented is to prove that the point is as conjectured. Hence, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a planar triangle with vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point is inside the triangle.\n- For acute triangles, the circumcenter is inside the triangle.\n- For obtuse triangles, the circumcenter lies outside the triangle.\n- The longest edge of an obtuse triangle is opposite the obtuse angle.\n\nWait, but maybe the assumptions should only list the given conditions, not the properties to be proven. The original problem states \"Given a triangle...\", so the assumptions are just the existence of the triangle and its vertices. However, the user's conjecture involves the type of triangle, so perhaps the problem is structured into two cases: acute and obtuse. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions would include that the triangle is either acute or obtuse, and the problem is to prove the point for each case.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify that; it's a general triangle. So perhaps the problem is to consider both cases, hence the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included a condition not in the original problem. That example might have been incorrect. For the current problem, perhaps the assumptions should list:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle is a planar triangle with vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point must be inside the triangle.\n- The problem considers both acute and obtuse triangles.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to structure it as per the example. The example took the original problem, which was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems like a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to filter unrelated information, but in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it by adding that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example's original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example is not properly formatted. Therefore, maybe the current problem should be formatted by extracting the key assumptions from the original question.\n\nOriginal question: Given a triangle with vertices V1, V2, and V3, what is the point inside the triangle that is farthest away from any vertex (i.e., the point which maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex). My first thought is that it is the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles, but I can't seem to prove this.\n\nKey points:\n\n- The problem is about finding a point inside a triangle.\n- The point maximizes the minimal distance to the three vertices.\n- The conjecture is that it's the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles.\n- The task is to prove this conjecture.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list assumptions related to the triangle's type (acute or obtuse) and the properties of the points (circumcenter, midpoint). However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state these as assumptions but rather as conjectures. Hence, the assumptions should be the basic conditions given in the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The triangle has vertices V1, V2, V3.\n- The point must be inside the triangle.\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that for any triangle (acute or obtuse), the point is as conjectured. So the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The triangle is a planar triangle.\n- The triangle is either acute or obtuse.\n- The point is inside the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe triangle is planar with vertices V1, V2, V3,\nThe triangle is either acute or obtuse,\nThe point is inside the triangle.\nProblem: Prove that the point inside the triangle which maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex is the circumcenter for acute triangles and the midpoint of the longest edge for obtuse triangles.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem doesn't explicitly state the triangle being acute or obtuse as an assumption but the conjecture splits into these cases, perhaps the assumptions are just the existence of the triangle and the point being inside. The rest is part of the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe triangle is a planar triangle with vertices V1, V2, V3,\nThe point is inside the triangle.\nProblem: Prove that the point inside the triangle which maximizes the minimum distance to each vertex is the circumcenter if the triangle is acute, and the midpoint of the longest edge if the triangle is obtuse.\n\nThat seems better. The assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the conjecture which involves cases based on the triangle's type. So the formatted problem would list the basic assumptions, and the problem statement includes the cases.",
