    "Content": "Let $X$ be a bounded random variable on a non-atomic probability space, i.e. $X\\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb P)$ , such that $\\mathbb E[X]=0$ . In a lecture, I heard someone claim that this implies the existence of two other random variables $Y,Z\\in L^\\infty(\\mathbb P)$ such that $Y\\stackrel{\\mathrm d}=Z$ and $X\\stackrel{\\mathrm d}=Y-Z$ , although they claimed the proof was difficult and tedious. Is this result even true? Even in simple examples I don't really see what this decomposition should look like. What is the intuition behind such a result? Is there perhaps a proof in the literature or in a textbook?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an attempt at a proof. I don't have a reference, or much intuition beyond this construction. Consider first the case of a variable $X$ taking the value $a<0$ with probability $b/(|a|+b)$ and\ntaking the value $b>0$ with probability $|a|/(|a|+b).$ Pick random variables $Y,Z$ uniformly distributed on $[a,b],$ with $Y=Z+b$ when $Z<0$ and $Y=Z+a$ when $Z\\geq 0.$ Then $Y-Z\\stackrel{\\mathrm d}= X$ as required. For the general case we can take a mixture, by pairing up the events $X<0$ and $X>0$ in a suitable way. Remark. We just need to write the law of $X$ as a weighted average of zero-mean probability distributions supported on two points. A slick way to do this is to use Choquet's theorem and a characterization of extreme points of the set of zero-mean variables, e.g. Winkler's \"Extreme Points of Moment Sets\" . The remainder of this answer is just a more explicit version of this. Let $\\mu$ be the law of $X.$ Let $M=\\tfrac 1 2 \\mathbb E|X|.$ There exists a Borel function $f^+:[0,M]\\to\\mathbb R_{>0}$ such that the pushforward of Lebesgue measure $f^+_*\\lambda$ is the measure $x d\\mu(x).$ For example, the generalized inverse of the function $t\\mapsto \\int_0^t x d\\mu(x).$ Similarly there exists a Borel function $f^-:[0,M]\\to\\mathbb R_{<0}$ such that $f^-_*\\lambda$ is the measure $|x| d\\mu(x).$ The pushforward of $(1/f^+(x))d\\lambda(x)$ under $f^+$ is $\\mu$ restricted to $\\mathbb R_{>0}.$ And similarly the pushforward of $(1/|f^-(x)|)d\\lambda(x)$ under $f^-$ is $\\mu$ restricted to $\\mathbb R_{<0}.$ Pick independent random variables $R,S,T$ such that $R$ is a Bernoulli random variable with $\\mathbb P[R=0]=\\mathbb P[X=0],$ $S$ is a random variable on $[0,M]$ distributed according to the measure $((1/f^+(x))+(1/|f^-(x)|))d\\lambda(x),$ $T$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1].$ Then define $Y$ and $Z$ by: wherever $R=0,$ we take $Y=Z=0,$ and skip the next steps. $Z$ is $T$ rescaled from $[0,1]$ to the interval $[f^-(S),f^+(S)].$ $Y$ is $Z+f^+(S)$ when $Z<0$ $Y$ is $Z+f^-(S)$ when $Z\\geq 0.$ $Z$ has the same distribution as $Y.$ The random variable $Y-Z$ has the same probability of being zero as $X.$ For any Borel $U\\subseteq\\mathbb R_{>0},$ the probability that $f^+(S)\\in U$ and $Y-Z=f^+(S)$ is $\\int (1/f^+(x))1_{f^+(x)\\in U}d\\lambda(x)=\\mu(U).$ So the laws of $Y-Z$ and $X$ are the same on $\\mathbb R_{>0}$ .\nAnd similarly for $\\mathbb R_{<0}.$ So this construction ensures $Y-Z\\stackrel{\\mathrm d}= X.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that for a bounded random variable X with expectation zero, there exist two random variables Y and Z that are equal in distribution such that X is equal in distribution to Y - Z. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions one by line, each addressing a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's go through the question step by step.\n\n1. The problem states that X is a bounded random variable on a non-atomic probability space. So the first assumption is \"X is a bounded random variable\" or \"X ∈ L^∞(ℙ)\". But the user's example uses more natural language, so maybe \"X is in L^∞(ℙ)\" is okay, but maybe better to write \"X is a bounded random variable on a non-atomic probability space.\"\n\nWait, the question mentions \"non-atomic probability space,\" so that's another condition. But the user's format requires each assumption to be one line, each addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a bounded random variable (X ∈ L^∞(ℙ)),\nThe probability space is non-atomic,\nThe expectation of X is 0 (E[X] = 0).\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Let X be a bounded random variable on a non-atomic probability space, i.e., X ∈ L^∞(ℙ), such that E[X] = 0.\" So three separate conditions: X is bounded, the space is non-atomic, and E[X] = 0. Each of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the existence of Y and Z such that Y and Z are equal in distribution (Y ~ Z) and X ~ Y - Z.\n\nSo the problem part would be: Prove that there exist random variables Y, Z ∈ L^∞(ℙ) such that Y and Z are equal in distribution and X is equal in distribution to Y - Z.\n\nBut wait, the original question is asking whether this result is true and for intuition or references. However, the user's format requires the problem to be structured as a statement to prove. The original question is phrased as a query about the truth of the claim, but the task is to structure it as a problem to solve. So probably, the problem part is the assertion that needs proof, as per the user's example where the original problem was to prove something, and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a bounded random variable (X ∈ L^∞(ℙ)),\nThe probability space is non-atomic,\nThe expectation of X is 0 (E[X] = 0).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist random variables Y, Z ∈ L^∞(ℙ) such that Y and Z are equal in distribution (Y ~ Z) and X is equal in distribution to Y - Z.\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, that wasn't explicitly stated. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, no, the example's original problem is \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That suggests that maybe the user's example has an error. But perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had some hidden assumption or the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the format, which for the example added an assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, no, the example's original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But this seems contradictory. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would limit the problem to n divisible by 7, which is not the original. So perhaps the example is wrong, but maybe the user intended to show how to extract assumptions. Hmm, maybe the example is actually a different problem where n is required to be divisible by 7. Perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction for the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states: Let X be a bounded random variable on a non-atomic probability space, such that E[X]=0. The claim is that there exist Y and Z with Y ~ Z and X ~ Y - Z. So the assumptions are clearly:\n\n1. X is a bounded random variable (X ∈ L^∞(ℙ)).\n2. The probability space is non-atomic.\n3. E[X] = 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition, so they should each be on their own line in the assumption section.\n\nThe problem is to prove the existence of Y and Z in L^∞(ℙ) such that Y and Z are equal in distribution and X is equal in distribution to Y - Z.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a bounded random variable (X ∈ L^∞(ℙ)),\nThe probability space is non-atomic,\nThe expectation of X is 0 (E[X] = 0).\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exist random variables Y, Z ∈ L^∞(ℙ) such that Y and Z are equal in distribution (Y ~ Z) and X is equal in distribution to Y - Z (X ~ Y - Z).\n\nNow, checking for each part: each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The problem is stated clearly. I think that's correct.",
