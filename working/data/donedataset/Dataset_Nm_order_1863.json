    "Content": "I've been working on some old prelims from my university when they used to just be on point-set topology. We don't cover a couple of the topics so I've been teaching myself some of the material, one of the topics no longer covered is Stone-Čech Compactification. Which I have a somewhat tenuous understanding of, at any rate one of the questions reads: Let $X$ be a completely regular topological space and let $\\beta(X)$ denote the Stone-Čech compactification of $X$. Show that every $y \\in \\beta(X) \\setminus X$ is a limit point of $X,$ but is not the limit of a sequence of points in $X$. It's clear to me how to go about the first part, $X$ if considered as a subset of $\\beta(X)$ is dense in $\\beta(X)$. Then it follows that for every point $y \\in \\beta(X) \\setminus X$ that every neighborhood of $y, U$ in $\\beta(X)$ will touch $X$. For the second part of the question, I must say, sadly, that I'm at a loss in general. Presumably we need to assume that we have some convergent sequence $\\{x_i\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ that converges to a point $y \\in \\beta(X) \\setminus X$ and show that this is a contradiction. But, probably due to my weak understanding of the Stone-Čech Compactification I am unsure of how to go about this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "EDIT: As pointed by Stefan H. in his comment , the solution I have suggested only works if $X$ is normal, since I am using Tietze extension theorem . Perhaps I have overlooked something and I will be blushing, but I will give it a try. (This is my solution, I did not check the books I mentioned in the above comment. Perhaps the proofs from those books can give you a hint for a different proof.) Let $x_n\\in X$ be a sequence which converges to $x\\in\\beta X\\setminus X$. We can assume that $x_n$'s are distinct.\nI will show bellow that $\\{x_n; n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ is closed discrete subspace of $X$. But first I will show how to use this fact. For any choice of $y_n\\in[0,1]$, $n\\in\\mathbb N$, we can define $f(x_n)=y_n$ and extend it continuously (by Tietze's theorem) to the whole $X$. \nNow there exists a continuous extension $\\overline f : \\beta X \\to [0,1]$. \nBy continuity, the sequence $y_n=\\overline f(x_n)$ converges to $\\overline f(x)$. We have shown that every sequence in $[0,1]$ is convergent, a contradiction. Now to the proof that  $\\{x_n; n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ is closed and discrete. Since $\\{x_n; n\\in\\mathbb N\\}\\cup\\{x\\}$ is a compact subset of $\\beta X$, it is closed in $\\beta X$. \nThe intersection with $X$ is $\\{x_n; n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ and it must be closed in $X$. Now we consider $\\{x_n; n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ as a subspace of $X$ and we want show that this subspace is discrete.\nChoose some $x_n$. By Hausdorffness, it can be separated from $x$, i.e. there exists a neighborhood $U\\ni x$ such that $x_n\\notin U$ and a\nneighborhood $V\\ni x_n$ with $V\\cap U=\\emptyset$. Now by convergence $U$ contains all but finitely many $x_n$'s, hence using Hausdorfness we can separate $x_n$ from the (finitely many) remaining ones.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem statement is written clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: The question is about Stone-Čech compactifications. The task is to show that every point y in β(X) \\ X is a limit point of X but not the limit of a sequence from X. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions that X is a completely regular topological space. That's one assumption. Then β(X) is the Stone-Čech compactification of X. Another assumption. The point y is in β(X) \\ X. That's a third assumption. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each on a separate line. So here, each condition on each object should be separate. Let me check:\n\n- X is a completely regular topological space. (This is a property of X)\n- β(X) is the Stone-Čech compactification of X. (This defines β(X))\n- y is an element of β(X) \\ X. (This specifies where y is located)\n\nSo these are the three assumptions. Then the problem is to show two things: y is a limit point of X, and y is not the limit of a sequence in X.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"Show that every y ∈ β(X) \\ X is a limit point of X, but is not the limit of a sequence of points in X.\"\n\nSo the formatted problem should have those three assumptions and the problem as stated. Let me structure that.\n\nAssumption:\nX is a completely regular topological space,\nβ(X) denotes the Stone-Čech compactification of X,\ny is an element of β(X) \\ X.\nProblem:\nShow that every y ∈ β(X) \\ X is a limit point of X, but is not the limit of a sequence of points in X.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions are listed as separate lines. So each bullet point is a separate line. The user's example used bullet points separated by commas in the text, but in the formatted version, it's written line by line. So in the formatted answer, each assumption is a separate line, each starting with a hyphen or something. But in the user's example, it's written as:\n\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = ...$$\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line, separated by commas. Wait, no. The example shows that each assumption is written in a line, separated by line breaks, but here in the original example, it's written as two separate lines. But in the example provided, the user wrote:\n\nAssumption: <list line by line... each assumption addresses only one property...>\n\nIn the example, the user listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on its own line. So in the answer, each assumption should be a separate line. Therefore, in the current problem, the three assumptions would each be on their own line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a completely regular topological space,\nβ(X) denotes the Stone-Čech compactification of X,\ny is an element of β(X) \\ X.\n\nWait, but in the example, each assumption is a separate line. So perhaps each line is a separate assumption. Let me check the example again:\n\nExample:\n\nassumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nproblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nIn the example, each assumption is on a separate line, separated by a comma. Wait, actually, in the example's formatted problem, the assumptions are written as two separate lines. But in the code block, they are separated by commas. Wait, maybe the user intended each assumption to be a separate line. Let me check the user's instruction again:\n\n\"Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\"\n\nSo each assumption is a single line. Therefore, in the example, \"n is an integer\" is one line, \"n is divisible by 7\" is another. So in the current problem, the three assumptions would each be their own line.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nX is a completely regular topological space,\nβ(X) denotes the Stone-Čech compactification of X,\ny is an element of β(X) \\ X.\nProblem:\nShow that every y ∈ β(X) \\ X is a limit point of X, but is not the limit of a sequence of points in X.\n###\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Show that every y ∈ β(X) \\ X is a limit point of X, but is not the limit of a sequence of points in X.\" So the problem is about all such y. However, the assumptions are about X being completely regular, β(X) being its Stone-Čech compactification, and y being a point in β(X) \\ X. Since the problem says \"every y\", the assumptions need to cover the conditions for all such y. Therefore, the assumptions are correctly listed as properties of X and β(X), and y being in that complement.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me verify again. The problem is to show two things for every y in β(X) \\ X: limit point, not a limit of a sequence. The assumptions required are the space X being completely regular (as Stone-Čech compactification exists for completely regular spaces), β(X) being the compactification, and y being in the remainder. Each of these is a separate assumption.",
