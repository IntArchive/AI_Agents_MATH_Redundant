    "Content": "In the upcoming World Chess Championship 14 games in the classical time format will be played compared to 12 in the previous matches. This change appears to have been made mainly to reduce the number of draws by allowing the players to take more risks, but it has also been stated that this decreases the chances of a tie in the overall series. Intuitively, this seems clear: the higher the total number of games, the less likely it is that both players win exactly the same number of games. A mathematical proof would be better, of course, and this is what I am after here. I want to consider a simple model for the general case with $2n$ games, $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . Let $p$ and $q$ be the probability for the first and second player to win any given game (independent of previous results, current form, etc.), respectively. Then $0 \\leq p, q, p + q \\leq 1$ holds and $1-p-q$ is the probability of a draw (we ignore the advantage for the player with the white pieces and interpret $p$ and $q$ as colour averages). Even though the series is not continued if one player takes an unassailable lead, we can pretend that all $2n$ games are played and compute the probability of $k$ wins for the first and $l$ wins for the second player from a trinomial distribution : \\begin{equation}\nf(p,q,n;k,l) =  \\binom{2n}{k,l,2n-k-l} p^k q^l (1-p-q)^{2n-k-l} . \n\\end{equation} The probability of an overall tie is \\begin{align}\nt(p,q,n) &= \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^n f(p,q,n;k,k) = \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^n \\frac{(2n)!}{k!^2 (2n-2k)!} (pq)^k (1-p-q)^{2n-2k} \\\\\n&= (1-p-q)^{2n} {}_2F_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}-n,-n;1;\\frac{4 p q}{(1-p-q)^2}\\right) .\n\\end{align} Provided that this reasoning is correct, my question is: How can we show that $t(p,q,n)$ is decreasing in $n$ for any given $p,q,p+q \\in [0,1]$ ? Some thoughts: Numerically, this clearly appears to be true. This is the probability of a tie for $q=p$ : In the special case $p=q=\\frac{1}{2}$ we have $$ t\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},n\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},n;n,n\\right) = \\frac{1}{4^n} \\binom{2n}{n} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int \\limits_0^\\infty \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{(1+x^2)^{n+1}} \\, , $$ which is clearly decreasing in $n$ . Maybe an integral representation can also be helpful in the general case. I do not know a lot about hypergeometric functions though and cannot find a transformation which would allow us to use Euler's integral formula .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nStarting with the original question on Math Stack Exchange. The user is talking about chess matches where the number of games has increased from 12 to 14, and they want to prove that the probability of a tie decreases as the number of games (modeled as 2n games) increases. They have a model where each game can be a win for player 1 with probability p, a win for player 2 with probability q, or a draw with probability 1 - p - q. The probability of a tie (both players winning the same number of games) is given by t(p, q, n), which is a sum over k from 0 to n of a trinomial coefficient times (pq)^k times (1 - p - q)^{2n - 2k}. The question is to show that this function t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q where p + q is in [0,1].\n\nFirst, let's list the assumptions. Each assumption should be one property applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. The number of games in the series is 2n, where n is a natural number.\n2. Each game has three possible outcomes: a win for the first player with probability p, a win for the second player with probability q, or a draw with probability 1 - p - q.\n3. The outcomes of the games are independent.\n4. The probabilities p and q satisfy 0 ≤ p, q, p + q ≤ 1.\n5. The probability of a tie in the series is given by t(p, q, n) = Σ_{k=0}^n [ (2n)! / (k!^2 (2n - 2k)!) ) * (pq)^k (1 - p - q)^{2n - 2k} ].\n6. The hypergeometric function representation of t(p, q, n) is provided but not necessary for assumptions unless specified. The user mentions this, but since the problem is about showing monotonicity, maybe this is extra info and not an assumption.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user has already derived t(p, q, n) as the sum, and the hypergeometric function is another representation. So the key assumptions are that p and q are fixed, the model is with 2n games, independent outcomes, and the tie probability is given by that sum. The question is to show t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q in [0,1] with p + q in [0,1].\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n- p and q are probabilities such that 0 ≤ p, q ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ p + q ≤ 1.\n- The outcomes of each game are independent.\n- The probability of a tie after 2n games is t(p, q, n) as defined by the sum.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition. Let me break them down line by line.\n\nAssumption:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. The number of games played is 2n.\n3. Each game has three possible outcomes: a win for the first player (probability p), a win for the second player (probability q), or a draw (probability 1 - p - q).\n4. The probability p satisfies 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.\n5. The probability q satisfies 0 ≤ q ≤ 1.\n6. The sum p + q satisfies 0 ≤ p + q ≤ 1.\n7. The outcomes of each game are independent of each other.\n8. The probability of an overall tie (equal wins for both players) after 2n games is given by t(p, q, n) = Σ_{k=0}^n [ (2n)! / (k!^2 (2n - 2k)! ) * (pq)^k (1 - p - q)^{2n - 2k} ].\n\nNow, the problem is to show that t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q, p + q ∈ [0,1].\n\nSo the problem statement would be: Prove that t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q, p + q ∈ [0,1].\n\nI need to check if I missed any assumptions. The user mentions that even if the series is stopped early if someone has an unassailable lead, they can pretend all 2n games are played. So the model assumes all games are played regardless of the interim results. That's an important assumption because otherwise, the probability might be different. But the user says \"we can pretend that all 2n games are played,\" so this is part of the model's assumption. Therefore, we should add that as an assumption.\n\nSo another assumption:\n\n9. All 2n games are played regardless of interim results (i.e., the series is not stopped early).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions list would include that.\n\nNow, compiling all the assumptions properly:\n\nAssumption:\n\n1. n is a natural number.\n2. The number of games played is 2n.\n3. Each game results in a win for the first player with probability p, a win for the second player with probability q, or a draw with probability 1 - p - q.\n4. The probability p satisfies 0 ≤ p ≤ 1.\n5. The probability q satisfies 0 ≤ q ≤ 1.\n6. The sum p + q satisfies 0 ≤ p + q ≤ 1.\n7. The outcomes of each game are independent.\n8. All 2n games are played regardless of interim results.\n9. The probability of a tie (both players winning the same number of games) after 2n games is given by t(p, q, n) = Σ_{k=0}^n [ (2n choose k, k, 2n - 2k) * (pq)^k (1 - p - q)^{2n - 2k} ].\n\nNow, the problem is to show that this t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q, p + q in [0,1].\n\nWait, the user states \"for any given p,q,p+q ∈ [0,1]\". But p and q are already given such that p + q ≤1. So maybe the problem is to show that for any p, q in [0,1] with p + q ∈ [0,1], t(p,q,n) is decreasing in n. So the problem statement would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that for any p, q ∈ [0,1] with p + q ∈ [0,1], the function t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n.\n\nBut in the user's original question, they wrote: \"How can we show that t(p,q,n) is decreasing in n for any given p,q,p+q ∈ [0,1] ?\"\n\nSo the user is saying that given p, q, p+q in [0,1], show t decreases with n. So maybe \"given p, q, such that p, q, p + q are in [0,1]\".\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement can be phrased as the user wrote: \"t(p,q,n) is decreasing in n for any given p,q,p+q ∈ [0,1]\".\n\nHence, the problem statement is:\n\nProve that t(p, q, n) is decreasing in n for any given p, q, p + q ∈ [0,1].\n\nBut to make sure, the key is that p and q are given such that p and q are in [0,1] and their sum is also in [0,1]. So the problem is for such p and q, t decreases as n increases.\n\nSo in the assumptions, we need to cover that p, q, p + q are in [0,1], which is covered in points 4,5,6.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions listed as above, each in a separate line, and the problem statement as per the user's request.",
