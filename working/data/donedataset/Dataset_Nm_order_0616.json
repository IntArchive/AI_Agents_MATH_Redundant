    "Content": "Is the following proposition true?\nIf yes, how would you prove this? Proposition Let $K$ be an algebraic number field.\nLet $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be the rings of algebraic integers in $K$ and $L$ respectively.\nLet $G$ be the Galois group of $L/K$.\nLet $C$ be a subring of $B$ such that $A \\subset C \\subset B$.\nSuppose $\\sigma(C) = C$ for every $\\sigma \\in G$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $A$.\nBy the lying-over theorem, there exists a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}$ of $C$ lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nLet $H$ = {$\\sigma \\in G$; $\\sigma(x) \\equiv x$ (mod $\\mathfrak{P}$) for all $x \\in C$}.\nSuppose $H = 1$.\nThen $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $L$. Motivation Let $K, A, L, B$ be as above.\nLet $n = [L : K]$.\nLet $f(X)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $n$ in $A[X]$.\nSuppose that $f(X)$ has no multiple roots.\nSuppose $L/K$ is the splitting field of $f(X)$.\nLet $\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n$ be the roots of $f(X)$.\nLet $C = A[\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n]$.\nThen $C$ satisfies the conditions of the above proposition.\nSometimes it's easy to verify $H = 1$.\nHence we can conclude that $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified in $L$. Application Let $f(X)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$.\nLet $d$ be the discriminant of $f(X)$.\nSuppose $d \\neq 0$.\nLet $L$ be the splitting field of $f(X)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $G$ be the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n$ be the roots of $f(X)$ in $L$.\nLet $C = \\mathbb{Z}[\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n]$.\nLet $p$ be a prime number not dividing $d$.\nLet $P$ be a prime ideal of $C$ lying over $p$.\nLet $H$ = {$\\sigma \\in G$; $\\sigma(x) \\equiv x$ (mod $P$) for all $x \\in C$}.\nLet $\\sigma \\in G -$ {1}.\nThere exists $i$ such that $\\sigma(\\alpha_i) \\neq \\alpha_i$.\nSince the discriminant of $f(X)$ is not divisible by $P$, $\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n$ are distinct mod $P$.\nHence $\\sigma$ does not belong to $H$.\nHence $H = 1$.\nHence $p$ is unramified in $L$ by the above proposition. Example Let $f(X) = X^3 + 2X + 1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}[X]$.\nLet $L$ be the splitting field of $f(X)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe discriminant of $f(X)$ is -59, where 59 is a prime number.\nHence if $p \\neq 59$ is a prime number, $p$ is unramified in $L$ by the above result. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-59})$.\nThe class number of $K$ is 3.\n$L/K$ is an abelian extension of degree 3.\nBy the above result, the only prime number which can be ramified in $L$ is 59.\nIt can be proved by another method that a prime of $K$ lying over 59 is unramified in $L$.\nHence $L$ is the Hilbert class field of $K$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Not an answer, but too long to fit into a comment. Clearly the assumption, $H=1$, implies that\nthe field of fractions $F$ of the intermediate ring $C$ is all of $L$, for otherwise\n$Gal(L/F)$ would be a non-trivial subgroup of $H$. Assume that $\\mathfrak{P}=\\mathfrak{P}_B\\cap C$ for some prime ideal $\\mathfrak{P}_B$ (necessarily lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$). Let $G_T=G_T(\\mathfrak{P}_B\\vert\\mathfrak{p})$ be the corresponding inertia group:\n$$\nG_T=\\{\\sigma\\in G\\mid \\sigma(\\mathfrak{P}_B)=\\mathfrak{P}_B,\\ \\forall\\,x\\in B: \\sigma(x)\\equiv x\\pmod{\\mathfrak{P}_B}\\}.\n$$ Assume that $\\sigma\\in G_T$. Let $x\\in C$ be arbitrary. Then $\\sigma(x)-x\\in C$ and\n$\\sigma(x)-x\\in\\mathfrak{P}_B$, so $\\sigma(x)-x\\in C\\cap\\mathfrak{P}_B=\\mathfrak{P}$.\nTherefore $\\sigma\\in H$. As we work under the assumption that $H$ is trivial, we can conclude that $G_T=1.$ Therefore\n$$\ne(\\mathfrak{P}_B\\vert \\mathfrak{p})=|G_T|=1.\n$$\nSo $\\mathfrak{P}_B\\vert \\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified, and the claim follows (by Galois theory of number fields the ramification indices over all the primes extending $\\mathfrak{p}$ are equal). So the question is reduced to asking whether all the primes of $C$ lying over $\\mathfrak{p}$ are gotten by restricting a prime of $B$. The mapping from the primes of $B$\nto those of $C$ is not necessarily injective, but the question is about its surjectivity. Edit: Makoto Kato points out that as $B$ is the integral closure of $C$, the surjectivity follows from general theory. As an example of the case, where this mapping is not injective I proffer\n$K=\\mathbb{Q}$, $L=K[\\sqrt3]$, $\\mathfrak{p}=13$, $C=\\mathbb{Z}[13\\sqrt3]$. The prime $13$\nsplits in $L$ as\n$$\n13=(4+\\sqrt3)(4-\\sqrt3),\n$$\nbut both prime ideals, $\\langle4+\\sqrt3\\rangle$ and $\\langle4-\\sqrt3\\rangle$ of $B$ intersect $C$ in \n$$\n\\mathfrak{P}=\\{a+b\\cdot13\\sqrt3\\mid a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z},\\ a\\equiv0\\pmod{13}\\}.\n$$ Anyway, my (possibly confused) thinking here is that $G_T$ would always inject into $H$. For an automorphism to be in $G_T$ we are to some extent asking more (in comparison to $H$), so if we can ascertain a trivial inertia group at the level of $C$, we should expect a trivial inertia group at the level of $B$ as well.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and separate the assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about whether a certain proposition is true regarding the unramification of a prime ideal in an order of a finite Galois extension. The proposition involves several mathematical objects: algebraic number fields, Galois extensions, rings of algebraic integers, a subring C invariant under the Galois group, a prime ideal lying over another, and a group H defined by congruence conditions. The main claim is that if H is trivial, then the prime ideal is unramified in the extension.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's go through the proposition step by step.\n\n1. K is an algebraic number field.\n2. L/K is a finite Galois extension.\n3. A is the ring of algebraic integers in K.\n4. B is the ring of algebraic integers in L.\n5. G is the Galois group of L/K.\n6. C is a subring of B such that A is a subset of C, which is a subset of B.\n7. For every σ in G, σ(C) = C.\n8. p is a prime ideal of A.\n9. There exists a prime ideal P of C lying over p (by lying-over theorem).\n10. H is the set of σ in G such that σ(x) ≡ x mod P for all x in C.\n11. H is the trivial group (H = 1).\n\nThe problem is to prove that under these conditions, p is unramified in L.\n\nI need to ensure each assumption is listed separately. Let me check again. The key points are the setup of K, L, their rings of integers, the subring C invariant under G, the prime ideals, and H being trivial. Each bullet point addresses one condition. For example, \"L/K is a finite Galois extension\" is one assumption. The invariance of C under G is another. The existence of P via lying-over is another. H being trivial is a separate assumption. All these should be listed as individual assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is the conclusion: that p is unramified in L.\n\nI need to make sure there's no overlap or combining multiple conditions into a single assumption. The example provided in the original question's formatting had each condition on its own line. The user also included even if some assumptions might seem basic, like n being an integer, so I should list all explicit and implicit conditions given in the proposition.\n\nWait, in the original problem's example, they included even the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, even though in the original problem statement it wasn't mentioned. Wait, actually, looking back, the original example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, n was just any integer. Wait, perhaps that was an error in the example? Or maybe the example was different. Wait, let me check again. Oh, the example given by the user says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was a bad one, but the user provided it. So perhaps in their formatting, they included assumptions that might have been part of a different problem? Hmm, maybe the example was not accurate. But regardless, the instruction is to structure the problem given here according to the format, listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the proposition's conditions are clearly laid out. Let me re-express them:\n\n- K is an algebraic number field.\n- L/K is a finite Galois extension.\n- A is the ring of algebraic integers in K.\n- B is the ring of algebraic integers in L.\n- G is the Galois group of L/K.\n- C is a subring of B with A ⊆ C ⊆ B.\n- σ(C) = C for every σ ∈ G.\n- p is a prime ideal of A.\n- There exists a prime ideal P of C lying over p (by lying-over theorem).\n- H is {σ ∈ G | σ(x) ≡ x mod P for all x ∈ C}.\n- H is trivial (H = 1).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. However, some are definitions (like A and B being the rings of algebraic integers), which are part of the setup. The key conditions are that C is G-invariant, the existence of P, and H being trivial.\n\nNow, the problem is to prove that p is unramified in L under these assumptions.\n\nI need to list each assumption as a separate line. Let me check if any of these can be combined or if they are separate:\n\n1. K is an algebraic number field.\n2. L/K is a finite Galois extension.\n3. A is the ring of algebraic integers in K.\n4. B is the ring of algebraic integers in L.\n5. G is the Galois group of L/K.\n6. C is a subring of B such that A ⊆ C ⊆ B.\n7. For every σ ∈ G, σ(C) = C.\n8. p is a prime ideal of A.\n9. There exists a prime ideal P of C lying over p (from lying-over theorem).\n10. H = {σ ∈ G | σ(x) ≡ x mod P for all x ∈ C}.\n11. H is the trivial group.\n\nEach of these is a distinct assumption. Even though some are part of the setup (like A and B being rings of algebraic integers), they are necessary conditions for the problem. So they should be listed as separate assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove that p is unramified in L.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are correctly parsed and none are missed. The original problem also includes some motivation and application, but those are examples and explanations, not part of the proposition's assumptions. The proposition itself is the main focus here.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have all the assumptions listed as above, each on their own line, and the problem statement is the conclusion that p is unramified in L.",
