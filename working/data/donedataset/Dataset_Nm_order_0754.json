    "Content": "On page 198 of Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics , he asks the reader to prove Cartan's formula\n$$\\tag{1}L_X=\\mathrm{d}i_X+i_X\\mathrm{d}$$\nwhere $L_X$ is the Lie derivative wrt. $X$, $\\mathrm{d}$ is the exterior derivative, and $i_X$ is the interior derivative (interior product). I am aware of the \"usual\" proof, i.e. to show that the action of $L_X$ on functions and differentials agrees with that of the action of the rhs. of (1). From that one may show this equality holds on all $p$-forms. However, Arnold offers a hint that completely changes the nature of the problem: We denote by $H$ the \"homotopy operator\" associating to a $k$-chain $\\gamma: \\sigma\\to M$ the $(k + 1)$-chain $H\\gamma: (I \\times \\sigma) \\to M$ according to the formula $(H\\gamma)(t, x) = g^t\\gamma(x)$ (where $I = [0, 1]$).\n  Then $g^1\\gamma - \\gamma = \\partial(H\\gamma) + H(\\partial\\gamma).$ ($g^t$ is the flow of $X$. I understand how to obtain the equation for the boundary of the homotopy of $\\gamma$.) Since we are given the equation for the boundary of $H\\gamma$, I thought it would be a good idea to integrate the differential of a $k$-form $\\omega$ over $H\\gamma$ and use Stokes' theorem, followed by the equation for the boundary:\n$$\\int_{H\\gamma}\\mathrm{d}\\omega=\\int_{\\partial(H\\gamma)}\\omega=\\int_{g^1\\gamma-\\gamma-H(\\partial\\gamma)}\\omega$$\nI don't see how this helps. Alternatively, on the right hand side, we can use the equation $\\int_{f(D)}\\omega=\\int_Df^*\\omega$ ($f^*$ is the pullback of $f$) to write\n$$\\int_{H\\gamma}\\mathrm{d}\\omega=\\int_{I\\times\\sigma}(H\\gamma)^*\\mathrm{d}\\omega$$\nUnfortunately, I don't know how to calculate $(H\\gamma)^*\\mathrm{d}\\omega$. How does one continue here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First of all, I think the formula for the homotopy should be $$ g^1 \\gamma -\\gamma = \\partial(H\\gamma) - H(\\partial \\gamma).$$ As the left hand side is the top minus the bottom, the right hand side then should be the boundary of $I\\times \\sigma$ minus the cylindrical part of the boundary ( $I\\times \\partial \\gamma$ ). Using that, we proceed to the proof. By fundamental theorem of calculus and $g^{s+t} = g^s g^t$ , for any $k$ -form $\\omega$ we have \\begin{align}\n(g^1)^*\\omega - \\omega &= \\int_0^1\\frac{d}{dt} (g^t)^*\\omega|_{t=s} \\ ds  \\\\\n&=\\int_0^1 (g^s)^* \\frac{d}{dt} (g^t)^* \\omega \\bigg|_{t=0} ds \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 (g^s)^* \\mathcal L_X \\omega \\ ds. \n\\end{align} If we integrate this on $\\gamma$ , by Fubini's theorem, $$\\int_\\gamma \\int_0^1 (g^s)^* \\mathcal L_X \\omega \\ ds = (-1)^k\\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* \\mathcal L_X \\omega \\ ds,$$ where $H_s : \\sigma \\to M$ is given by $H_s(x) = H(s, x) = g^s \\gamma(x)$ . Note that $H_0 = \\gamma$ . On the other hand, $$\\begin{split}\n\\int_\\gamma (g^1)^* \\omega - \\omega &= \\int_{g^1 \\gamma - \\gamma} \\omega \\\\\n&= \\int_{\\partial (H\\gamma) - H(\\partial \\gamma)} \\omega \\\\\n&= \\int_{H\\gamma} d\\omega - \\int_{H(\\partial \\gamma)} \\omega.\n\\end{split}$$ Now we use that (prove later) for any $r$ -form $\\alpha$ and for $r-1$ chain $\\gamma$ we have $$\\tag{1} \\int_{H\\gamma}\\alpha = (-1)^{r-1}\\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* i_X \\alpha\\ ds,$$ then $$\\begin{split}\n\\int_\\gamma (g^1)^* \\omega - \\omega &= (-1)^k\\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* i_X d\\omega \\ ds - (-1)^{k-1} \\int_0^1 \\int_{\\partial\\gamma}H_s^* i_X \\omega \\ ds\\\\\n&= (-1)^k \\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* (i_X d\\omega + di_X \\omega) \\ ds . \n\\end{split}$$ Hence $$\\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* \\mathcal L_X \\omega \\ ds =  \\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_s^* (i_X d\\omega + di_X \\omega) \\ ds .$$ Note that if we consider the homotopy $G_t$ , which is the restriction of $H\\gamma$ to $[0, t]\\times \\sigma$ , then similarly we have $$\\int_0^t \\int_\\gamma H_s^* \\mathcal L_X \\omega \\ ds =  \\int_0^t \\int_\\gamma H_s^* (i_X d\\omega + di_X \\omega) \\ ds $$ for all $t >0$ . Thus (using $H_0 = \\gamma$ ) $$   \\int_\\gamma  \\mathcal L_X \\omega= \\int_\\gamma (i_X d\\omega + di_X \\omega).$$ As the above holds for all $\\gamma$ , we have $$ \\mathcal L_X \\omega = i_X d\\omega + di_X \\omega.$$ It remains to prove $(1)$ . Let $\\alpha$ be an $r$ form. By definition, (call $H\\gamma = F$ ) $$\\int_{H\\gamma} \\alpha = \\int_{I \\times \\sigma} F^*\\alpha$$ if we write in local coordinates $(t = x^0, x_1, \\cdots, x_{r-1})$ in $I\\times \\sigma$ and $(y^1, \\cdots, y^m)$ of $M$ . $$\\begin{split} \nF^* \\alpha (t, x)&= F^* \\left(\\sum_{|I| = r} \\alpha_{i_1\\cdots i_{r}} dy^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dy^{i_{r}}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{|I| =r}  \\alpha_{i_1\\cdots i_{r}} (F(t, x)) dF^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dF^{i_{r}} \\\\\n\\end{split}$$ Note that $$dF^{i_j} = \\frac{\\partial F^{i_j}}{\\partial t} (t, x) dt + \\sum_{p=1}^{r-1} \\frac{\\partial F^{i_j}}{\\partial x^p} (t, x) dx^p = X^{i_j}(F(t,x)) dt + H_t^* dy^{i_j} $$ as $X = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t}$ by definition of $F = H\\gamma$ . Thus $$\\begin{split} \nF^* \\alpha&= \\sum_{|I| =r}  \\alpha_{i_1\\cdots i_{r}} \\left( X^{i_1} dt + H_t^* dy^{i_1}\\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\left( X^{i_{k+1}} dt + H_t^* dy^{i_{r}}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{|I| =r}  \\alpha_{i_1\\cdots i_{r}} \\ dt \\wedge H_t^* \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{r}(-1)^{j-1} X^{i_j} dy^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\hat{dy^{i_j}} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dy^{i_{r}}\\right) \\\\ \n&= \\sum_{|I| =k+1}  \\alpha_{i_1\\cdots i_{r}} \\ dt \\wedge H_t^*\\left( i_X (dy^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dy^{i_{r}})\\right) \\\\\n&= dt \\wedge H_t^*(i_X \\alpha) = (-1)^{r-1} H_t^* (i_X\\alpha) \\wedge dt. \n\\end{split}$$ Thus $$ \\int_{H\\gamma} \\alpha = (-1)^{r-1} \\int_{I\\times \\sigma} H_t^*(i_X \\alpha) \\wedge dt = (-1)^{r-1} \\int_0^1 \\int_\\gamma H_t^*(i_X \\alpha) dt.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The title is \"Proving Cartan's magic formula using homotopy.\" The user mentions Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, page 198, where the task is to prove Cartan's formula: L_X = d i_X + i_X d. The usual proof involves showing agreement on functions and differentials, but Arnold suggests a homotopy approach. \n\nThe question describes using a homotopy operator H that turns a k-chain γ into a (k+1)-chain Hγ by using the flow g^t of the vector field X. The key equation given is g¹γ - γ = ∂(Hγ) + H(∂γ). The user tried integrating dω over Hγ using Stokes' theorem and pullbacks but got stuck.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The assumptions should be single conditions applied to single objects. Let's see:\n\n1. The problem is set in the context of differential forms and Lie derivatives.\n2. The homotopy operator H is defined as associating a k-chain γ to a (k+1)-chain Hγ via (Hγ)(t, x) = g^tγ(x), where I = [0,1].\n3. The equation g¹γ - γ = ∂(Hγ) + H(∂γ) holds, where ∂ is the boundary operator.\n4. The flow g^t is associated with the vector field X.\n5. The integrals are considered using Stokes' theorem and pullbacks of differential forms.\n\nThe problem is to prove Cartan's magic formula L_X = d i_X + i_X d using the homotopy approach outlined. \n\nWait, the original problem is to prove Cartan's formula using homotopy, with the given hint involving the homotopy operator H and the equation relating the boundary. The user is stuck on how to proceed with integrating dω over Hγ and handling the pullbacks.\n\nBut for the structured format, the assumptions should list all conditions given. Let me list each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n- Let H be the homotopy operator that maps a k-chain γ: σ → M to a (k+1)-chain Hγ: I × σ → M defined by (Hγ)(t, x) = g^tγ(x), where I = [0, 1].\n- The flow g^t is generated by the vector field X.\n- The equation g¹γ − γ = ∂(Hγ) + H(∂γ) holds, where ∂ is the boundary operator.\n- The Lie derivative L_X acts on differential forms.\n- The exterior derivative is denoted by d.\n- The interior product with X is denoted by i_X.\n\nProblem: Prove Cartan's magic formula L_X = d i_X + i_X d using the homotopy operator H and the given equation involving the boundary operator.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement is \"prove Cartan's formula...\" with the hint. The user is asking how to proceed with their approach using the homotopy operator. However, the structured problem should just state the problem to be solved, not the user's specific roadblock. So the problem is to prove that L_X equals d i_X + i_X d using the homotopy method described, which involves the homotopy operator H and the boundary equation.\n\nSo the assumptions would include the definition of H, the flow relation, the boundary equation, and the operators involved (Lie derivative, exterior derivative, interior product). Each of these is a separate assumption line.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is a single property applied to one object. Let's break them down:\n\n1. H is the homotopy operator mapping a k-chain γ to a (k+1)-chain Hγ via (Hγ)(t, x) = g^tγ(x), where I = [0, 1]. (This defines H and its action.)\n2. The flow g^t is generated by the vector field X. (This links g^t to X.)\n3. The equation g¹γ − γ = ∂(Hγ) + H(∂γ) holds for any chain γ. (This is a key relation involving the boundary operator.)\n4. L_X denotes the Lie derivative with respect to X. (Defines L_X.)\n5. d denotes the exterior derivative. (Defines d.)\n6. i_X denotes the interior product with X. (Defines i_X.)\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove Cartan's formula L_X = d i_X + i_X d using these assumptions.\n\nThe original problem might not explicitly mention all these definitions, but since they're part of the context given in the question, they need to be included as assumptions. For example, the user mentions \"the Lie derivative wrt. X\", so we can assume that's given. Similarly, d and i_X are standard operators in this context.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and state the problem as proving the formula.",
