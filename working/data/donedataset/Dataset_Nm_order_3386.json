    "Content": "Obviously if $\\frac{n}{3}$ is an integer then $\\dfrac{2n}{3}$ is an integer. But what if $\\frac{n}{3}$ is not an integer? Can it be proven that $\\dfrac{2n}{3}$ is not an integer (or, more specifically, an even multiple of 3) if $\\frac{n}{3}$ is not an integer? I feel that intuitively this must be true, but I am not a mathematician and my idle algebraic musings aren't helping me. Is there a quick, simple proof one way or the other? [Sorry if this is mistagged.]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Simply notice that $\\rm\\displaystyle\\ \\frac{n}3 + \\frac{2n}3 = n\\in \\mathbb Z\\ \\ $ thus $\\rm\\displaystyle\\ \\frac{n}3\\in\\mathbb Z \\iff \\frac{2n}3\\in \\mathbb Z.\\,$ This works precisely because $\\rm\\mathbb Z$ is an additive subgroup of $\\rm\\:\\mathbb Q,\\:$ i.e. a subset closed under subtraction. For if $\\rm\\:S\\:$ is a subgroup of a group and $\\rm\\ a+b\\ = s \\in S\\ $ then $\\rm\\ a = b-s \\in S\\!\\iff\\! a+s = b\\in S,\\, $ so your property holds. Conversely if the property holds and $\\rm\\:a,b\\in S\\ $ then since $\\rm\\, (a-b)+b = a \\in S\\, $ the property implies that $\\rm\\: a-b\\in S\\:,\\: $ so (nonempty) $\\rm\\:S\\:$ is closed under subtraction, so $\\rm\\:S\\:$ is a subgroup, by the subgroup test. See also the below complementary form of the subgroup property from my prior post.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether if n divided by 3 isn't an integer, then 2n divided by 3 also isn't an integer. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem to make sure I understand it. They want to prove that if n/3 is not an integer, then 2n/3 is not an integer either. Alternatively, they phrase it as 2n/3 not being an even multiple of 3, but I think the main point is just whether 2n/3 is an integer at all when n/3 isn't.\n\nLet me start by considering the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P,\" and they are logically equivalent. So, if we can prove that if 2n/3 is an integer, then n/3 must be an integer, that would suffice.\n\nSuppose 2n/3 is an integer. Let’s denote that integer as k. So, 2n/3 = k ⇒ n = (3k)/2. Now, for n to be an integer, 3k must be even. Since 3 is odd, k must be even for 3k to be even. Let’s write k as 2m, where m is an integer. Then n = (3*2m)/2 = 3m. Therefore, n = 3m, which implies that n/3 = m, an integer. So, if 2n/3 is an integer, then n/3 is also an integer. Therefore, by contrapositive, if n/3 is not an integer, then 2n/3 is not an integer. That seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic. If n/3 is not an integer, then n ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. Let’s check both cases:\n\nCase 1: n ≡ 1 mod 3. Then 2n ≡ 2*1 = 2 mod 3. So 2n/3 would leave a remainder of 2, meaning it's not an integer.\n\nCase 2: n ≡ 2 mod 3. Then 2n ≡ 2*2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3. So 2n/3 would leave a remainder of 1, again not an integer.\n\nTherefore, in both cases where n/3 isn't an integer (i.e., n ≡1 or 2 mod 3), 2n/3 is also not an integer. This also proves the statement.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned \"more specifically, an even multiple of 3.\" Let me check that part. If 2n/3 were an even multiple of 3, then 2n/3 = 3*2k = 6k for some integer k. Then 2n = 18k ⇒ n = 9k, which would mean n is a multiple of 9, hence certainly a multiple of 3. Therefore, if n/3 is not an integer, 2n/3 cannot be an even multiple of 3. So both the general statement and the specific case hold.\n\nSo, there are at least two ways to approach this: contrapositive and modular arithmetic. Both lead to the conclusion that if n/3 is not an integer, then 2n/3 isn't either. The user might be satisfied with either proof. Since the problem is about proving this statement, the key assumptions are that n is an integer and that n/3 is not an integer. The problem is to show that under these conditions, 2n/3 is also not an integer.",
