    "Content": "I define $\\text{Ab}(G)=G/[G,G]$ where $[G,G]$ is the commutator subgroup. I want to show that $$\\text{Ab}(G_1*G_2)\\cong \\text{Ab}(G_1)\\oplus\\text{Ab}(G_2)$$ This page gives a categorical proof, but I don't know much category theory. Can someone give a purely group-theoretic proof of this (I know the universal property of abelianizations)? By the universal property, it would suffice to show that the RHS is an abelianization of $G_1*G_2$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $A$ be an abelian group. Then $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\text{Hom}(G_1\\ast G_2, A) & = & \\text{Hom}(G_1,A)\\times \\text{Hom}(G_2,A) \\\\\n& = & \\text{Hom}(Ab(G_1),A)\\times \\text{Hom}(Ab(G_2),A) \\\\\n& = & \\text{Hom}(Ab(G_1)\\oplus Ab(G_2),A)\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ and there you have your universal property. Explicitly, for any group $G$ I write $[g]_G$ for the class of $g\\in G$ in $Ab(G)$ . Then you get $\\varphi: Ab(G_1\\ast G_2)\\to Ab(G_1)\\oplus Ab(G_2)$ defined by $\\varphi([g_1h_1g_2h_2\\cdots g_rh_r]_{G_1\\ast G_2}) = \\left( [g_1\\cdots g_r]_{G_1}, [h_1\\cdots h_r]_{G_2}\\right)$ with $g_i\\in G_1$ , $h_i\\in G_2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read through the user's question carefully. The original problem is about showing that the abelianization of the free product of two groups, G1 and G2, is isomorphic to the direct sum of their abelianizations. The user mentions using the universal property of abelianizations and wants a group-theoretic proof instead of the categorical one provided on a webpage.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement:\n\n1. The abelianization of a group G is defined as Ab(G) = G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup.\n2. The goal is to show that Ab(G1*G2) is isomorphic to Ab(G1) ⊕ Ab(G2).\n3. The user acknowledges the universal property of abelianizations, so that might be an assumption here. The universal property states that any homomorphism from G to an abelian group factors uniquely through Ab(G).\n4. The free product G1*G2 is involved, so the properties of free products might be relevant. However, since the user wants a group-theoretic proof, maybe we don't need to list the definition of free products as an assumption, but perhaps the problem inherently assumes knowledge of free products.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions on G1 and G2 other than being groups. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- G1 and G2 are groups.\n- Ab(G) is defined as G modulo its commutator subgroup.\n- The universal property of abelianizations holds (i.e., any homomorphism from G to an abelian group factors through Ab(G)).\n- The free product G1*G2 is considered.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be a single line, each applying to one object. So let me break it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G1 is a group.\n- G2 is a group.\n- Ab(G) = G/[G,G] for any group G.\n- The universal property of abelianizations holds: any homomorphism from G to an abelian group factors uniquely through Ab(G).\n\nThe problem is to show that Ab(G1*G2) is isomorphic to Ab(G1) ⊕ Ab(G2).\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back, the example given by the user had the original problem as proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But the user is instructing me to follow the example structure. Hmm. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, but the user's formatted problem added an assumption. But in the actual task, the user wants me to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions.\n\nLooking back at the current problem: the original question states that the user wants to prove Ab(G1*G2) ≅ Ab(G1) ⊕ Ab(G2). The user mentions knowing the universal property of abelianizations. So the key assumptions here are that G1 and G2 are groups, the definition of abelianization, and the universal property. The free product is part of the problem statement. So the assumptions would include:\n\n- G1 is a group.\n- G2 is a group.\n- Abelianization of a group G is defined as G/[G,G].\n- The universal property of abelianizations holds.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any additional constraints on G1 and G2. So the assumptions are just the basic definitions and properties needed. The problem is to show the isomorphism between the abelianization of the free product and the direct sum of the abelianizations. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions line by line, each as a single property applied to one object.",
