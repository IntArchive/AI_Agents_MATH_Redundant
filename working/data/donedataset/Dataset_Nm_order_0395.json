I'd like to tell something about how I get this answer. I estimate that there will be a solution to $n=4,$(I also tried $n=3$,but failed.) Let $a,b,c$ be rational numbers,and $a+b+c=1,a,b,c>0,$we get\n$$\\frac{a}{1-a}+\\frac{b}{1-b}+\\frac{1-a-b}{a+b}=4.\\tag{eq.1}$$\ndenote $\\dfrac{a}{1-a}=s,\\dfrac{b}{1-b}=t,$then $a=\\dfrac{s}{1+s},b=\\dfrac{t}{1+t},$\n$eq.1$ is equivalent to $$s+t+\\dfrac{1-st}{s+t+2st}=4,\\tag{eq.2}$$\ndenote $s=x+y,t=x-y,$then$$\\frac{4 x^3+3 x^2-4 x y^2+y^2+1}{2 \\left(x^2+x-y^2\\right)}=4$$\n$$y^2=\\frac{4 x^3-5 x^2-8 x+1}{4 x-9}$$\ndenote $x=\\dfrac{9k+1}{4k},$then $$y^2=\\frac{(13 k+1) \\left(4 k^2+9 k+1\\right)}{16 k^2}$$\ndenote $r=4ky,$then $$r^2=(13 k+1) \\left(4 k^2+9 k+1\\right)=1 + 22 k + 121 k^2 + 52 k^3$$\ndenote $X=52k,Y=52r,$then $$Y^2 = X^3 + 121 X^2 + 1144 X + 2704.\\tag{eq.3}$$\nSo we just need to find a rational solution of $eq.3$ which makes $a,b,c>0.$ I find two basic solutions of $eq.3,(X,Y)=(-104,260)(52,728),$we denote $p=(-104,260),q=(52,728),$ At first,I find that $6q=O,$when I calculate $p,2p,3p,4p,\\cdots$ ,I find that $21p$ makes $-52<X<-33.8564,$in fact,$X\\approx -36.8062,$this is what we need,because when $-52<X<-33.8564,a,b,c$ will all be positive(it need some calculation). Finally,we can get $a,b,c>0$ from $X,Y,$ and then multiply by the LCM of the denominators of $a,b,c,$ we are done. You can see that I only use $p,$ but no $q$ or other points on $eq.3,$so I have to plus $21$ times by $p$,which makes the digits so huge.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants to find an integer in the form of the expression I = (a/(b+c)) + (b/(c+a)) + (c/(a+b)) where a, b, c are natural numbers. They mentioned using Nesbitt's inequality which gives I ≥ 3/2, and they are trying to prove I ≤ 2 to show that there's no a, b, c such that I is an integer. But they got stuck in their algebraic manipulations and now think proving I ≤ 2 might not be the right approach.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states a, b, c are natural numbers. So that's one assumption. The problem is to find an integer in the form of I, but they are trying to show that no such integers exist by proving I is between 3/2 and 2, excluding integers. Wait, but the user wants to structure the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the example added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a different case.\n\nWait, the example shows that maybe the user had an original problem with some conditions, but the formatted problem extracted specific assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition? Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake? Because in the original problem, it says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction.\n\nWait, the user provided an example where the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So in that case, perhaps the user is expecting to filter the problem's conditions and list each assumption line by line, even if they are not explicitly stated but derived from the problem's context. But in that case, the original problem's statement is \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the only assumption is n is integer, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had some hidden conditions, but the user's example seems conflicting. This might be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. For instance, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So the assumptions would be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the formatted example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user made an error in their example. However, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut perhaps in their example, the original problem had a typo or missing information. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show that when n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". This is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the example is not correctly structured. But the user provided it, so perhaps the task is to extract assumptions from the problem as presented, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ find integer in the form: I = ... Using Nesbitt's inequality: I ≥ 3/2. I am trying to prove I ≤ 2 to implies there ∄ a,b,c such that I ∈ ℤ: ... and stuck.\" So the problem is to find an integer in the form I, given a, b, c are natural numbers. But the user is trying to show that no such integers exist by bounding I between 3/2 and 2. However, their attempt to prove I ≤ 2 led to complicated algebra and they are stuck. They also note that maybe proving I ≤ 2 is not a good approach.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- a, b, c are natural numbers (i.e., positive integers).\n\nThe problem is to show that there do not exist a, b, c ∈ ℕ such that I is an integer. But the user's approach is to show that I is strictly between 3/2 and 2, so no integer exists in that interval. However, the problem is that Nesbitt's inequality gives I ≥ 3/2, but to show I < 2, thereby implying that I can't be an integer (since the only integer between 3/2 and 2 is none). But the user tried to prove I ≤ 2 but got stuck, and then realized maybe that's not the right path.\n\nSo the problem, as structured, should list the assumptions and then the problem statement. The assumptions are:\n\n1. a, b, c are natural numbers (i.e., a, b, c ∈ ℕ).\n\nThe problem is to show that there does not exist a, b, c ∈ ℕ such that I is an integer. But the original problem says \"find integer in the form: I = ...\", which might be a bit ambiguous. But the user is trying to show that no such integers exist. Therefore, the problem is to prove that I cannot be an integer for any a, b, c ∈ ℕ.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated in the user's question is: \"find integer in the form: I = ...\" given a, b, c ∈ ℕ. However, using Nesbitt's inequality (I ≥ 3/2), the user is trying to prove I ≤ 2 to show that there's no integer solutions. So the problem is to find integer values of I, but the user is trying to show that no such integers exist.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement should be: Prove that there do not exist natural numbers a, b, c such that I = (a/(b+c)) + (b/(c+a)) + (c/(a+b)) is an integer.\n\nBut the user's original problem was to \"find integer in the form...\", but the actual content shows they are trying to prove no such integers exist. So the formatted problem should reflect the actual problem the user is working on, which is to show that I cannot be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are natural numbers.\n\nThe problem is to prove that there do not exist natural numbers a, b, c such that I is an integer.\n\nBut the user mentions trying to bound I between 3/2 and 2, but they got stuck. So perhaps the problem is to show that I cannot be an integer, which would follow if I is always in (3/2, 2). But the user is trying to prove I ≤ 2 and is stuck.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the user's example:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems to contradict, but perhaps the user made a mistake. For the current problem, the user's problem is:\n\nOriginal problem: Let a, b, c ∈ ℕ. Find integer in the form: I = ... Using Nesbitt's inequality: I ≥ 3/2. Trying to prove I ≤ 2 to show no a, b, c make I integer.\n\nSo the formatted problem should capture the essential assumptions and problem. The assumptions are a, b, c are natural numbers, and the problem is to show that I cannot be an integer. However, the user's approach is to bound I between 3/2 and 2, but they are stuck on proving the upper bound.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the format should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption: a, b, c are natural numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist a, b, c ∈ ℕ such that I = (a/(b+c)) + (b/(c+a)) + (c/(a+b)) is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem is to find integers of the form I, then the problem is to find integers expressible as I for some a, b, c ∈ ℕ. But the user's work is trying to show none exist. But the problem as stated in the title is \"find integer in the form...\", so maybe the problem is to determine whether such integers exist and find them if they do. However, the user's work suggests they are trying to prove no solutions exist.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best way is to structure the problem as per the user's intent as described in the question. The user is trying to show that I cannot be an integer, so the problem is to prove that I is never an integer for any a, b, c ∈ ℕ.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are natural numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there do not exist natural numbers a, b, c such that $$I = \\frac{a}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{c+a} + \\frac{c}{a+b}$$ is an integer.\n\nBut let's check the example again. The example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. But maybe the example is incorrect. But the user provided it, so perhaps they intended to extract specific conditions from the problem, even if not explicitly stated. However, that seems risky. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had additional conditions that weren't clear.\n\nIn the current case, the user's problem states a, b, c are natural numbers. The problem is to find an integer in the form I. But the user's work is to show no such integer exists. Therefore, the problem as structured should reflect that. So the assumptions are a, b, c ∈ ℕ, and the problem is to prove that I cannot be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are natural numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there do not exist natural numbers a, b, c such that $$I = \\frac{a}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{c+a} + \\frac{c}{a+b}$$ is an integer.\n\nBut wait, the original title says \"Find integer in the form...\", but the question body is about showing no such integer exists. So perhaps the problem is to either find integers of that form or show none exist. However, based on the user's attempt, the problem is to show non-existence. So that's the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \na, b, c are natural numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that there do not exist natural numbers a, b, c such that $$I = \\frac{a}{b+c} + \\frac{b}{c+a} + \\frac{c}{a+b}$$ is an integer.\n###",
