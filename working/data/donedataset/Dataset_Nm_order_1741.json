    "Content": "I'm trying to prove this: $T : V \\to V$ linear transformation. $W$ subspace of $V$. If $W$ is $T$-invariant then the minimal polynomial for the restriction operator $T|_W$ divides the minimal polynomial for $T$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think this will work: Suppose $V$ is a vector space over the field $\\Bbb F$ , with $\\dim V = N < \\infty$ .  Then the minimal polynomial of $T$ is the monic polynomial $m(x)  \\in \\Bbb F[x]$ of least degree such that $m(T)  = 0$ identically on $V$ .  As such, we have $m(T) = 0$ on $W$ as well, whence $m(T_{\\vert W}) = 0$ .  Now let $m_W(x) \\in \\Bbb F[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of the restriction $T_{\\vert W}$ of $T$ to $W$ .  Since $\\Bbb F$ is a field, the usual division algorithm for polynomials holds in $\\Bbb F[x]$ .  Thus we may write $m(x) = m_W(x)q(x) + r(x)$ for some unique $q(x), r(x) \\in \\Bbb F[x]$ with either $r(x) = 0$ or $0 \\le \\deg r(x) < \\deg m_W(x)$ , whence $r(x) = m(x) - m_W(x)q(x)$ .  Then $r(T_{\\vert W}) = m(T_{\\vert W}) - m_W(T_{\\vert W})q(T_{\\vert W}) = 0$ .  Now in the event $r(x) \\ne 0$ , let the leading coefficient of $r(x)$ be $\\beta \\in \\Bbb F$ .  Set $r'(x) = \\beta^{-1} r(x)$ .  Then $r'(x)$ is monic, $\\deg r'(x) = \\deg r(x)$ , and furthermore $r'(T_{\\vert W}) = \\beta^{-1} r(T_{\\vert W}) = 0$ .  But since $\\deg r'(x) < \\deg m_W(x)$ , this contradicts the minimality of $m_W(x)$ unless $r'(x) = \\beta^{-1}r(x) = 0$ .  Thus $r(x) = 0$ and hence $m_W(x) \\mid m(x)$ .  QED Note Added in Edit, Sunday 29 August 2021 10:16 PM PST: Though the above proof seems pretty straightforward to me, by and large, I feel the assertion made in the third sentence, that \"As such, we have $m(T) = 0$ on $W$ as well, whence $m(T_{\\vert W}) = 0$ ,\" may be further clarified.  We observe that the given $T$ -invarinace of $W \\subset V \\tag{1}$ allows us to write $Tw \\in W \\tag 2$ for any $w \\in W; \\tag 3$ also, for any such $w$ , by definition we have $T_{\\vert W} w = Tw, \\tag 4$ and thus by virtue of (2) we may write $T_{\\vert W}Tw = TTw = T^2w, \\tag{4.5}$ and hence, in accord with (2)-(4.5), we further have $T^2_{\\vert W} w = T_{\\vert W} T_{\\vert W} w = T_{\\vert W} Tw = TTw = T^2w; \\tag 5$ indeed, at this point we may allow a simple induction to take over, assuming $T^k_{\\vert W} w = T^k w \\tag{6}$ for some $k \\in \\Bbb N$ and any $w \\in W$ ; then since $T^k_{\\vert W} w \\in W$ we may write $T^{k + 1}_{\\vert W} w = TT^k_{\\vert W} w = TT^k w = T^{k + 1}w; \\tag 7$ from this it is easy to see that for any $p(x) \\in \\Bbb F[x] \\tag 8$ $p(T_{\\vert W})w = p(T)w \\tag 9$ provided $w \\in W$ ; and from this we readily conclude that $m(T)w = m(T_{\\vert W})w = 0 \\tag{10}$ as well. End of Note. Cheers, and as always, Fiat Lux!!!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the minimal polynomial of the restriction of a linear operator T to a T-invariant subspace W divides the minimal polynomial of T itself. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the question carefully.\n\nThe problem states: T is a linear transformation from V to V. W is a subspace of V. W is T-invariant. Then, the minimal polynomial of T restricted to W (denoted T|_W) should divide the minimal polynomial of T. \n\nSo breaking this down:\n\n1. T is a linear transformation from V to V. That's one assumption about T being a linear operator on V.\n2. W is a subspace of V. That's an assumption about W.\n3. W is T-invariant. This is another property of W related to T.\n4. The problem is to show that the minimal polynomial of T|_W divides the minimal polynomial of T.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But here, the problem might not have such numerical conditions. Instead, the conditions are about the properties of T, W, and the invariance.\n\nSo, each line in the assumption should list one property. Let's check:\n\n- T is a linear transformation on V. (That's one line)\n- W is a subspace of V. (Second line)\n- W is T-invariant. (Third line)\n\nThese are three separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove that the minimal polynomial of T|_W divides the minimal polynomial of T.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only one condition per line. For example, \"T : V → V is a linear transformation\" is one condition. \"W is a subspace of V\" is another. \"W is T-invariant\" is a third. \n\nI don't see any other hidden assumptions here. The problem is straightforward once these conditions are met. Let me double-check the original question. The user wrote: \"If W is T-invariant then the minimal polynomial for the restriction operator T|_W divides the minimal polynomial for T.\" So the key assumptions are T being linear, W being a subspace, and W being invariant under T. \n\nYes, that's all. So the formatted problem should list these three assumptions, each on their own line, followed by the problem statement about the minimal polynomial divisibility.",
