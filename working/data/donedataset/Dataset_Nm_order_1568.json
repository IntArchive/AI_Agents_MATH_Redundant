    "AcceptedAnswer": "(i) For $n \\geq 2$ , the function $x \\mapsto \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^x $ is strictly increasing and hence $x_n > 1$ . Then by the Jensen's inequality, $$ n = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{x_n} \\geq \\biggl( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\biggr)^{x_n} = \\biggl( \\frac{n+1}{2} \\biggr)^{x_n} $$ and hence $$ x_n \\leq \\frac{\\log n}{\\log((n+1)/2)}. $$ This proves that $x_n \\to 1$ by the squeezing lemma. (ii) Consider the functions $f(t) = t^{x_n}$ and $g(t) = 2t - 1$ . We observe that $f(t)$ is strictly convex on $[0, \\infty)$ , $f(1) = g(1) = 1$ , and $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} g(k)$ . Since $f$ is strictly convex and intersects with the line $g$ at $t = 1$ , one of the following two scenarios must arise: Scenario 1 : $f(t) > g(t)$ for all $t > 1$ , or Scenario 2 : There exists $t_* \\geq 1$ with $f(t_*) = g(t_*)$ such that $f(t) < g(t)$ for $t \\in (1, t_*)$ and $f(t) > g(t)$ for $t > t_*$ . However, Item 3 leaves the second scenario as the only possible case with $t_* \\leq n$ . Hence, it follows that $f(n+1) > g(n+1)$ and we have $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k^{x_n} > \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k-1) = (n+1)^2. $$ From this, we conclude that $x_n > x_{n+1}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle part (ii) of this problem. The user already did part (i) and found that the limit of x_n is 1. Now they need to show that the sequence {x_n} is monotone for n ≥ 4. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what's given. For each n ≥ 4, x_n is the unique solution to the equation 1^{x} + 2^{x} + ... + n^{x} = n². We need to prove that the sequence x_n is either non-decreasing or non-increasing starting from n=4.\n\nSince the limit is 1, maybe the sequence approaches 1 from above or below. If it's approaching from above, the sequence might be decreasing, and if from below, increasing. But how do we figure out which direction?\n\nLet me think about the behavior of the function S(x) = 1^x + 2^x + ... + n^x. For each fixed n, S(x) is a strictly increasing function in x because each term k^x is increasing if k > 1, and 1^x is constant. Wait, but 1^x is 1 regardless of x. So S(x) is increasing since the terms 2^x, 3^x, etc., increase with x. Therefore, since S(x_n) = n², and as n increases, what happens to x_n?\n\nWhen n increases, the left-hand side S(x_n) = n² is getting larger. But how does x_n adjust? If x_n increases, then S(x_n) would increase even more, but since n² is increasing, maybe x_n has to decrease? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, consider two consecutive terms: x_n and x_{n+1}. For n ≥ 4, x_n satisfies 1^{x_n} + ... + n^{x_n} = n², and x_{n+1} satisfies 1^{x_{n+1}} + ... + (n+1)^{x_{n+1}}} = (n+1)². If we can show that x_{n+1} < x_n or x_{n+1} > x_n for all n ≥4, then the sequence is monotone.\n\nSuppose we try to compare x_n and x_{n+1}. Let's denote S_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n k^x. Then S_n(x_n) = n². For the next term, S_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = (n+1)^2. \n\nIf we fix x = x_n, then S_{n+1}(x_n) = S_n(x_n) + (n+1)^{x_n} = n² + (n+1)^{x_n}. Compare this to (n+1)^2. So S_{n+1}(x_n) = n² + (n+1)^{x_n}. If x_n is such that (n+1)^{x_n} > (n+1)^2, then S_{n+1}(x_n) would be greater than n² + (n+1)^2, which is more than (n+1)^2. But in reality, x_{n+1} is chosen so that S_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = (n+1)^2. Therefore, since S_{n+1}(x) is increasing in x, if S_{n+1}(x_n) > (n+1)^2, then x_{n+1} < x_n. So we need to check if (n+1)^{x_n} > (n+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's compute S_{n+1}(x_n) = n² + (n+1)^{x_n}. We want to compare this to (n+1)^2. If (n+1)^{x_n} > (n+1)^2 - n². Let's compute (n+1)^2 - n² = 2n +1. So if (n+1)^{x_n} > 2n +1, then S_{n+1}(x_n) > (n+1)^2, which would imply x_{n+1} < x_n.\n\nAlternatively, if (n+1)^{x_n} < 2n +1, then x_{n+1} > x_n.\n\nSo the key is to find out whether (n+1)^{x_n} is greater or less than 2n +1.\n\nBut we know from part (i) that as n tends to infinity, x_n approaches 1. So when n is large, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈ (n+1)^1 = n+1. But 2n +1 is about 2n. For large n, n+1 is less than 2n, so (n+1)^{x_n} ≈ n+1 < 2n +1. Therefore, S_{n+1}(x_n) ≈ n² + (n+1) < n² + 2n +1 = (n+1)^2. Thus, S_{n+1}(x_n) < (n+1)^2. Since S_{n+1}(x) is increasing in x, to reach (n+1)^2, we need to increase x. Therefore, x_{n+1} > x_n. So this suggests that for large n, the sequence is increasing. But since the limit is 1, maybe the sequence is increasing towards 1? Wait, but the limit is 1, so if it's increasing and approaching 1, it must be approaching from below? But x_n is approaching 1. If x_n is increasing and approaching 1, then it's approaching from below. But earlier when n is large, we have x_n ≈1, so if it's increasing, maybe x_n is approaching 1 from below. However, the user's calculation in part (i) says lim x_n =1, and their expression was lim x_n =1 + ln2 / ln(n+1). Wait, as n approaches infinity, ln(n+1) approaches infinity, so ln2 / ln(n+1) approaches 0, so x_n approaches 1 from above? Because 1 + something positive approaching zero. So x_n is slightly above 1 for large n. Then, if x_n approaches 1 from above, maybe the sequence is decreasing?\n\nWait, there seems to be a contradiction here. Let me check the user's work for part (i). They said:\n\nlim_{n→∞} (1^{x_n} + ... +n^{x_n}) /n² =1 ⇒ via Stolz-Cesàro theorem, lim_{n→∞} (n+1)^{x_n} / (2n +1) =1. Then, with some calculations, they get lim x_n = lim [1 + ln2 / ln(n+1)] →1.\n\nSo, if x_n is approximately 1 + ln2 / ln(n+1), then as n increases, ln(n+1) increases, so ln2 / ln(n+1) decreases to zero. Therefore, x_n approaches 1 from above. So x_n is a small amount above 1, decreasing towards 1. Therefore, the sequence x_n is decreasing. So, perhaps the sequence is decreasing for n ≥4.\n\nBut how to formalize this? The user needs to show that {x_n} is monotone. The approach would be to show that x_{n+1} < x_n for all n ≥4.\n\nTo do this, perhaps consider the function f_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n k^x -n². Then x_n is the solution to f_n(x)=0. Similarly, x_{n+1} solves f_{n+1}(x)=0. We need to relate x_n and x_{n+1}.\n\nAlternatively, note that when n increases to n+1, the sum gains a term (n+1)^x, and the right-hand side increases from n² to (n+1)². The increase in the sum must compensate for the increase in the right-hand side. Since the new term (n+1)^x is added, and the right-hand side increases by 2n+1, we need to analyze how the balance between these two affects x.\n\nIf we assume that x_n is decreasing, then each subsequent x is smaller. But how to set up the inequality?\n\nAlternatively, suppose we define the difference between the equations for n and n+1. Let’s write the equation for n+1:\n\nsum_{k=1}^{n+1} k^{x_{n+1}} = (n+1)^2.\n\nSimilarly, for n:\n\nsum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} = n².\n\nSubtracting these two equations:\n\nsum_{k=1}^n [k^{x_{n+1}} - k^{x_n}] + (n+1)^{x_{n+1}}} = (n+1)^2 -n² = 2n +1.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.\n\nConsider the function S_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n k^x. For each n, S_n(x_n) = n². For n+1, S_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) = (n+1)^2. Let's look at S_{n+1}(x_n). Since S_{n+1}(x_n) = S_n(x_n) + (n+1)^{x_n} = n² + (n+1)^{x_n}. If we can compare this to (n+1)^2, then:\n\nIf n² + (n+1)^{x_n} < (n+1)^2, then since S_{n+1}(x) is increasing in x, to reach (n+1)^2, we need to increase x. Hence, x_{n+1} > x_n. Conversely, if n² + (n+1)^{x_n} > (n+1)^2, then x_{n+1} < x_n.\n\nSo, the key inequality is whether (n+1)^{x_n} < (n+1)^2 -n² = 2n +1.\n\nThus, if (n+1)^{x_n} < 2n +1, then x_{n+1} >x_n. If the opposite, then x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nSo we need to check whether (n+1)^{x_n} < 2n +1 for n ≥4.\n\nBut from part (i), we know that x_n approaches 1 as n→∞. So for large n, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈ (n+1)^1 =n+1. Now, n+1 vs 2n+1. For n≥4, 2n+1 is larger than n+1 (since 2n+1 - (n+1)=n >0). Therefore, for large n, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈n+1 <2n+1, so x_{n+1} >x_n. But since x_n approaches 1 from above, according to the user's result lim x_n=1+ [something going to 0]. Wait, but if x_n approaches 1 from above, then x_n is slightly larger than 1. So (n+1)^{x_n} = (n+1)^{1 + ε_n} where ε_n is small and positive. Then (n+1)^{1 + ε_n} = (n+1) * (n+1)^{ε_n} ≈ (n+1)(1 + ε_n ln(n+1)) by the approximation a^ε ≈1 + ε ln a for small ε.\n\nTherefore, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈ (n+1) + ε_n (n+1) ln(n+1).\n\nWe need to compare this to 2n +1. Let's see:\n\n(n+1) + ε_n (n+1) ln(n+1) ≈ n +1 + ε_n n ln n.\n\nBut according to the user's calculation in part (i), ε_n ≈ ln2 / ln(n+1). So substituting:\n\n≈ n +1 + (ln2 / ln(n+1)) * n ln n.\n\nSimplify:\n\n≈ n +1 + ln2 * n (ln n / ln(n+1)).\n\nAs n becomes large, ln(n+1) ≈ ln n, so ln n / ln(n+1) ≈1. Therefore, this term is approximately n +1 + ln2 *n.\n\nTherefore, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈n +1 + ln2 *n ≈ (1 + ln2)n +1. Since ln2 ≈0.693, so 1 + ln2 ≈1.693. Thus, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈1.693n +1.\n\nCompare to 2n +1. Clearly, 1.693n +1 <2n +1 for all n ≥1. Therefore, for large n, (n+1)^{x_n} ≈1.693n +1 <2n +1, hence x_{n+1} >x_n. But if x_{n} is approaching 1 from above, and x_{n+1} >x_n, that would mean the sequence is increasing, which contradicts the approach to 1 from above. Wait, but if x_n is approaching 1 from above and increasing, that can't be because 1 is the limit. If it's increasing and approaching 1 from above, it would have to exceed 1, but that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The user's result says lim x_n =1, and from their expression, lim x_n =1 + ln2 / ln(n+1). Wait, actually, that expression isn't a limit as n→∞, but rather an approximation for x_n. Wait, let's see the user's steps:\n\nThey wrote:\n\nlim_{n→∞} (1^{x_n} + ... +n^{x_n}) /n² =1 ⇒ via Stolz-Cesàro, lim_{n→∞} (n+1)^{x_n} / (2n +1) =1. Then, they say with some calculations, lim x_n = lim [1 + ln2 / ln(n+1)].\n\nWait, perhaps they took the limit of (n+1)^{x_n}/(2n+1) =1. So (n+1)^{x_n} ≈2n+1. Taking log on both sides:\n\nx_n ln(n+1) ≈ ln(2n +1) ≈ ln(2n) = ln2 + lnn.\n\nTherefore, x_n ≈ (ln2 + lnn)/ln(n+1) ≈ (lnn + ln2)/ln(n+1). Now, ln(n+1) = lnn + ln(1 +1/n) ≈ lnn +1/n. So x_n ≈ (lnn + ln2)/(lnn +1/n) ≈ [1 + (ln2)/lnn] / [1 +1/(n lnn))] ≈1 + (ln2)/lnn -1/(n lnn) using first-order approximation. Therefore, x_n ≈1 + (ln2)/lnn as n→∞. Hence, x_n approaches 1 from above, since (ln2)/lnn is positive but tending to zero.\n\nTherefore, x_n ≈1 + (ln2)/lnn. So as n increases, (ln2)/lnn decreases, so x_n decreases towards 1. Therefore, the sequence x_n is decreasing for large n. But this seems conflicting with the previous analysis where we thought x_{n+1} >x_n. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the previous analysis. Let's go back. If x_n ≈1 + (ln2)/lnn, then x_{n+1} ≈1 + (ln2)/ln(n+1). Since ln(n+1) >lnn, so (ln2)/ln(n+1) < (ln2)/lnn. Therefore, x_{n+1} <x_n. Therefore, the sequence is decreasing. This matches the approximation that x_n approaches 1 from above, decreasing.\n\nBut earlier, when we considered S_{n+1}(x_n) =n² + (n+1)^{x_n} ≈n² +2n +1 (since (n+1)^{x_n}≈2n +1), which equals (n+1)^2, implying that x_{n+1} =x_n. But according to the approximation, x_{n} is decreasing.\n\nThis suggests that the initial analysis might have a flaw. Because when we say (n+1)^{x_n} ≈2n +1, which implies that S_{n+1}(x_n)≈(n+1)^2, hence x_{n+1}=x_n. But this is only in the limit. However, in reality, there might be a small difference that makes x_{n+1} slightly less than x_n.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to be more precise. Let's suppose that x_n =1 + c_n, where c_n→0 as n→∞. Then, (n+1)^{x_n} = (n+1)^{1 +c_n} = (n+1)(n+1)^{c_n} ≈(n+1)(1 +c_n ln(n+1)). So S_{n+1}(x_n) =n² + (n+1)(1 +c_n ln(n+1)) ≈n² +n+1 +c_n (n+1) ln(n+1). But this must equal (n+1)^2 =n² +2n +1. Therefore:\n\nn² +n +1 +c_n (n+1) ln(n+1) ≈n² +2n +1\n\nSubtracting n² +1 from both sides:\n\nn +c_n (n+1) ln(n+1) ≈2n\n\nSo:\n\nc_n (n+1) ln(n+1) ≈n\n\nThus:\n\nc_n ≈n / [(n+1) ln(n+1)] ≈1/[ln(n+1)]\n\nWhich aligns with the earlier approximation c_n≈ln2 /ln(n+1). Therefore, this suggests that the leading term in c_n is of order 1/lnn. Therefore, x_n =1 + O(1/lnn). \n\nNow, to compare x_{n} and x_{n+1}, we can write:\n\nx_n =1 + c_n\n\nx_{n+1}=1 +c_{n+1}\n\nWe need to show that c_n is decreasing, which would imply x_n is decreasing.\n\nFrom the approximation c_n ≈ ln2 / lnn, then c_{n+1} ≈ln2 / ln(n+1). Since ln(n+1) >lnn, c_{n+1} <c_n, so x_{n+1} <x_n. Therefore, the sequence is decreasing.\n\nBut to rigorously prove this, we need more than just the asymptotic approximation. We need to show that for all n ≥4, x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nPerhaps we can use induction. Suppose that x_n is decreasing. Assume that x_k is decreasing for k ≤n, then show x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(n) =x_n. We need to show that f(n+1) <f(n).\n\nAnother approach is to consider the difference between the equations for n and n+1.\n\nLet’s denote S_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n k^x. For each n, S_n(x_n) =n². For n+1, S_{n+1}(x_{n+1})=(n+1)^2.\n\nDefine the function g(n,x) = S_n(x) -n². Then x_n is the solution to g(n,x)=0. Similarly for x_{n+1}.\n\nConsider the derivative of g with respect to x: dg/dx = sum_{k=1}^n k^x ln k. Since all terms are positive for k≥2, the derivative is positive. Hence, x_n is uniquely defined because g(n,x) is strictly increasing in x.\n\nNow, let's look at the function h(n) =x_n. We need to show that h(n+1) <h(n).\n\nSuppose that h(n+1) ≥h(n). Then, x_{n+1} ≥x_n.\n\nBut S_{n+1}(x_{n+1})= (n+1)^2. Since x_{n+1} ≥x_n, then S_{n+1}(x_{n+1}) ≥S_{n+1}(x_n).\n\nBut S_{n+1}(x_n) =S_n(x_n) + (n+1)^{x_n} =n² + (n+1)^{x_n}.\n\nTherefore, (n+1)^2 ≥n² + (n+1)^{x_n}\n\nHence, (n+1)^{x_n} ≤(n+1)^2 -n²=2n+1.\n\nBut from part (i), we know that as n→∞, (n+1)^{x_n}≈2n+1. However, for finite n, if we can show that (n+1)^{x_n} <2n+1, then this would imply that x_{n+1} >x_n, contradicting the assumption that x_{n+1} ≥x_n. Therefore, if we can show that (n+1)^{x_n} <2n+1 for all n≥4, then x_{n+1} >x_n, which would mean the sequence is increasing. But wait, earlier asymptotic analysis suggests the sequence is decreasing. There's a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial terms (n≥4) behave differently. For small n, say n=4,5,6, perhaps the sequence is increasing, but for larger n, it becomes decreasing. But the problem states to prove that {x_n} is monotone for n≥4. So it must be either non-decreasing or non-increasing for all n≥4.\n\nGiven the confusion here, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's consider the function x(n) and try to find its derivative with respect to n. Since n is discrete, this is not straightforward, but we can approximate it as a continuous variable.\n\nAssume n is a continuous variable, and x(n) satisfies sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)} =n². Differentiate both sides with respect to n:\n\nd/dn [sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)}] = d/dn [n²]\n\nUsing Leibniz's rule for differentiation under the summation:\n\nsum_{k=1}^n [k^{x(n)} ln k * x'(n)] + (n+1)^{x(n)} =2n\n\nBut this is complicated. Alternatively, use the chain rule. Let’s denote S(n,x(n)) = sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)}. Then dS/dn + dS/dx * x'(n) =2n.\n\nThe term dS/dn is the derivative of the sum with respect to the upper limit n, which is just n^{x(n)}. The term dS/dx is sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)} ln k. Therefore:\n\nn^{x(n)} + [sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)} ln k] *x'(n) =2n\n\nSolving for x'(n):\n\nx'(n) = [2n -n^{x(n)}] / [sum_{k=1}^n k^{x(n)} ln k]\n\nWe need to determine the sign of x'(n). The denominator is positive since all terms are positive. So the sign depends on the numerator: 2n -n^{x(n)}.\n\nIf 2n -n^{x(n)} >0, then x'(n) >0, so x(n) is increasing. If <0, decreasing.\n\nBut from part (i), we know that x(n) approaches 1 as n→∞. Let's approximate for large n. Then x(n)≈1 +c, where c is small. So n^{x(n)}=n^{1 +c}=n*n^c≈n*e^{c ln n}≈n*(1 +c ln n). Therefore:\n\n2n -n^{x(n)}≈2n -n -c n ln n= n -c n ln n.\n\nBut from the earlier analysis, c≈ln2 / ln n. So substituting:\n\n≈n - (ln2 / ln n)*n ln n= n -ln2 *n= n(1 -ln2).\n\nSince ln2≈0.693, 1 -ln2≈0.307>0. Therefore, 2n -n^{x(n)}≈0.307n >0. Hence, x'(n) >0, implying x(n) is increasing. But this contradicts the previous conclusion from the asymptotic analysis where x(n)≈1 +ln2 /ln n, which is decreasing.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests a mistake in the continuous approximation. Wait, maybe the continuous approximation isn't valid here because the actual sequence is discrete, and the continuous model may not capture the actual behavior.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try with specific values. Let's take n=4 and compute x_4, then n=5, x_5, and see.\n\nFor n=4: Solve 1^{x} +2^{x} +3^{x} +4^{x}=16.\n\nWe need to find x such that the sum equals 16.\n\nLet’s test x=2: 1+4+9+16=30 >16.\n\nx=1:1+2+3+4=10 <16.\n\nx=1.5:1 + 2^{1.5}=2.828 +3^{1.5}=5.196 +4^{1.5}=8. Total≈1+2.828+5.196+8≈17.024>16.\n\nSo x_4 is between 1 and1.5.\n\nUsing linear approximation:\n\nAt x=1:10\n\nAt x=1.5:17.024\n\nNeed to reach 16. So the difference from x=1.5 is 17.024-16=1.024.\n\nThe difference between x=1.5 and x=1 is0.5.\n\nAssume linearity (which is approximate):\n\nThe required x is 1.5 - (1.024)/(17.024-10)*0.5 ≈1.5 -1.024/(7.024)*0.5≈1.5 -0.5*0.145≈1.5-0.0725≈1.4275.\n\nBut actual function is increasing, so need to do more precise calculation.\n\nLet’s try x=1.4:\n\n1 +2^{1.4}=2.639 +3^{1.4}=4.655 +4^{1.4}=6.964.

At x=1.425, sum≈15.258 (from x=1.4) + interpolation. Wait, perhaps better to compute:\n\nAt x=1.425:\n\n2^{1.425}=2^{1+0.425}=2*2^{0.425}≈2*1.35≈2.7\n\n3^{1.425}=3^{1+0.425}=3*3^{0.425}≈3*1.56≈4.68\n\n4^{1.425}=4^{1+0.425}=4*4^{0.425}≈4*1.76≈7.04\n\n5^{1.425}=5^{1+0.425}=5*5^{0.425}≈5*1.93≈9.65\n\nTotal≈1+2.7+4.68+7.04+9.65≈25.07≈25. So x_5≈1.425.\n\nSo x_4≈1.45, x_5≈1.425. So x_5 <x_4. So sequence is decreasing from n=4 to5.\n\nSimilarly, check n=6.\n\nFor n=6, sum=36.\n\nAssume x=1.4:\n\nSum=1+2.639+4.655+6.964+9.518+12.68 (6^{1.4}=6*6^{0.4}≈6*1.903≈11.418, wait, need precise calculation.\n\nWait, 6^{1.4}=e^{1.4 ln6}≈e^{1.4*1.792}≈e^{2.509}≈12.3.\n\nSo sum≈1+2.639+4.655+6.964+9.518+12.3≈36.076>36.\n\nThus x_6≈1.4.\n\nBut for n=5, x_5≈1.425. So x_6≈1.4 <x_5. Therefore, decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, n=7 would require x≈1.38, etc. So empirically, the sequence is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the sequence {x_n} is decreasing for n≥4. Hence, it's monotone (specifically, decreasing).\n\nTo prove this rigorously, we need to show that x_{n+1} <x_n for all n≥4.\n\nFrom the earlier analysis, if we can show that (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, then S_{n+1}(x_n)=n² + (n+1)^{x_n} >n² +2n+1=(n+1)^2, hence x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's correct that. If S_{n+1}(x_n) > (n+1)^2, then since S_{n+1}(x) is increasing in x, to reduce the sum to (n+1)^2, we need to decrease x. Hence, x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nConversely, if S_{n+1}(x_n) < (n+1)^2, then x_{n+1} >x_n.\n\nSo to have x_{n+1} <x_n, we need S_{n+1}(x_n) > (n+1)^2.\n\nBut from part (i), we have that for large n, S_{n+1}(x_n)=n² + (n+1)^{x_n}≈n² +2n+1=(n+1)^2. But in reality, as per our earlier approximation, (n+1)^{x_n}≈2n+1 +small term. Therefore, if (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, then S_{n+1}(x_n) > (n+1)^2, hence x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nBut from the user's work in part (i), they derived that (n+1)^{x_n}/(2n+1)→1, so (n+1)^{x_n}≈2n+1. Therefore, the difference between (n+1)^{x_n} and2n+1 could be either positive or negative, but for large n, the approximation is tight.\n\nHowever, based on the numerical examples for n=4,5,6, we see that x_n is decreasing. Therefore, likely the sequence is decreasing for all n≥4.\n\nTo formalize this, we might need to use induction or another inequality.\n\nAssume that for some n≥4, x_n >x_{n+1}. Need to show x_{n+1} >x_{n+2}.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio (n+1)^{x_n}/(2n+1). From part (i), this approaches1 as n→∞. But for finite n, we need to check if it's greater than1.\n\nIf (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, then x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\nFrom the numerical examples, for n=4:\n\n(n+1)=5, x_4≈1.45. So 5^{1.45}=5*5^{0.45}≈5*1.93≈9.65. Compare to 2*4+1=9. So 9.65>9, so x_5 <x_4.\n\nFor n=5: (n+1)=6, x_5≈1.425. 6^{1.425}=6*6^{0.425}≈6*1.95≈11.7. Compare to 2*5+1=11. 11.7>11, so x_6 <x_5.\n\nSimilarly, n=6:7^{x_6}≈7^{1.4}=7*7^{0.4}≈7*2.13≈14.91. Compare to 2*6+1=13. 14.91>13, so x_7 <x_6.\n\nThis pattern holds. Therefore, for n≥4, (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, hence x_{n+1} <x_n. Therefore, the sequence is decreasing.\n\nTo prove this for all n≥4, we need to show that (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1 for all n≥4.\n\nAssume that for n≥4, x_n >1. Then, (n+1)^{x_n} > (n+1)^1 =n+1. But 2n+1 >n+1 for n≥1. So this isn't sufficient.\n\nBut from the numerical examples, for n=4,5,6, it's true. Let's try to see if (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1 for n≥4.\n\nAssume inductively that for n=k≥4, x_k is such that (k+1)^{x_k} >2k+1, hence x_{k+1} <x_k.\n\nBase case: n=4. As above, (5)^{1.45}≈9.65>9=2*4+1. True.\n\nInductive step: Assume true for n=k, i.e., (k+1)^{x_k} >2k+1. Then x_{k+1} <x_k. Need to show for n=k+1, i.e., (k+2)^{x_{k+1}} >2(k+1)+1=2k+3.\n\nBut since x_{k+1} <x_k, and k+2 >k+1, the term (k+2)^{x_{k+1}} vs (k+1)^{x_k}. Not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the inequality x_n >1 + c for some c>0.\n\nBut this approach is not clear. Another idea: since x_n decreases and approaches1, and for each n, (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, which is true based on numerical evidence and the approximation that (n+1)^{x_n}≈2n+1. However, to formally prove this inequality for all n≥4, we might need to use the function's properties.\n\nConsider the equation sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} =n². Let's bound (n+1)^{x_n} from below.\n\nNote that sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} =n². The largest term in the sum is n^{x_n}. So n^{x_n} ≤n². Therefore, x_n ≤2. But we already know x_n approaches1, so for n≥4, x_n is between1 and2.\n\nBut how to show that (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1.\n\nFrom the equation sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n}=n². The sum is dominated by the largest term n^{x_n}. Suppose x_n were equal to2, then sum_{k=1}^n k² =n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. For n≥4, this is much larger thann². Therefore, x_n must be less than2. But we need a better lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, note that sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} =n². For x_n=1, sum is n(n+1)/2. For n≥4, n(n+1)/2 <n². For example, n=4: 10 <16. So to reach sum=n², x_n must be greater than1. But we need more.\n\nAssume that for n≥4, x_n >1. Then sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} > sum_{k=1}^n k =n(n+1)/2. But n(n+1)/2 <n² for n≥3. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for x>1, sum_{k=1}^n k^x >n^x. So n^x <n² →x<2. But this doesn't help.\n\nAnother angle: Assume that (n+1)^{x_n} ≤2n+1. Then sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n} =n² = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^{x_n} +n^{x_n}. If (n+1)^{x_n} ≤2n+1, but we have to relate this to the sum. Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Assume that for n=k≥4, (k+1)^{x_k} >2k+1, so x_{k+1} <x_k. Now, for n=k+1, need to show (k+2)^{x_{k+1}} >2(k+1)+1=2k+3.\n\nSince x_{k+1} <x_k, and k+2 >k+1, it's not directly comparable. However, if we can show that (k+2)^{x_{k+1}} >2k+3.\n\nBut since x_{k+1} solves sum_{m=1}^{k+1} m^{x_{k+1}} = (k+1)^2.\n\nThis sum includes (k+1)^{x_{k+1}}. To relate this to (k+2)^{x_{k+1}}, perhaps not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the numerical evidence, I think the sequence is decreasing for n≥4. Therefore, the answer to part (ii) is that {x_n} is monotonically decreasing for n≥4.\n\nTo summarize, the key steps are:\n\n1. For each n≥4, x_n is the unique solution to sum_{k=1}^n k^{x_n}=n².\n\n2. When comparing x_n and x_{n+1}, we find that if (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, then x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\n3. Numerical calculations for n=4,5,6 show that (n+1)^{x_n} >2n+1, hence x_{n+1} <x_n.\n\n4. Asymptotic analysis supports that x_n approaches1 from above, implying the sequence is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the sequence {x_n} is monotonically decreasing for n≥4.",
