    "Content": "This is a question in Liu's book. Let $X$ be a quasi-compact scheme. Show that $X$ contains a closed point. Well I'm unable to do this question, so any help would be appreciated. This question also makes me curious to know about the meaning/use of closed points of a scheme in general - by that I mean a scheme which is not an algebraic variety/local scheme over a field, which has a geometric meaning. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Kevin Lin's answer regarding the meaning of closed points is quite reasonable, especialy in the case when the scheme in question underlies a classical variety.  I want to add some additional remarks and examples for thinking about more general schemes. Here are some tautological remarks: recall that a point $x$ in a scheme $X$ is called a specialization of $y$ if $x$ lies in the Zariski closure of $y$ (and $y$ is called a generalization of $x$ ).  So tautologically, a closed points is one that cannot be specialized any further (just as a generic point cannot be generalized any further).  What does specialization really mean:\nring theoretically, it means taking the image under a homomorphism; so if $\\mathfrak p$ and $\\mathfrak q$ are prime\nideals of a ring $A$ , then $\\mathfrak q$ is a specialization of $\\mathfrak p$ in $\\text{Spec} A$ if and only if $\\mathfrak q$ contains $\\mathfrak p$ , i.e. if $A/\\mathfrak p$ surjects onto $A/\\mathfrak q$ .  It is perhaps best to think of an example: say $A$ is $\\mathbb C[x,y]$ , $\\mathfrak p$ is the prime ideal gen'd by $(x-1)$ and $\\mathfrak q$ is the prime (actually maximal ideal) gen'd by $(x-1,y)$ .  Then in $A/\\mathfrak p$ , we have \"specialized\" the value of $x$ to equal $1$ (because we have declared $x-1 = 0$ ) but $y$ is still a free variable.  When we pass to the further quotient $A/\\mathfrak q$ , we have specialized both $x$ and $y$ : $x$ is specialized to $1$ and $y$ is specialized to $0$ .   At this point, we can't specialize any more; technically, this is because $\\mathfrak q$ is a maximal ideal of $A$ ,\nso a closed point of $\\text{Spec} A$ ; intuitively, it is because both $x$ and $y$ have now both been \"specialized\" to actual numbers, and so we can't specialize any further. But suppose now we set $B = \\mathbb Z[x,y]$ , and take $\\mathfrak p$ and $\\mathfrak q$ to be the same, i.e. gen'd by $x-1$ and by $(x-1,y)$ respectively.  Then $\\mathfrak q$ is not maximal; there is more capacity for specialization.\nHow is this?  Well, $x$ and $y$ are now taking values in $\\mathbb Z$ (rather than the field $\\mathbb C$ ) and so we can also reduce both $x$ and $y$ modulo some prime, say $5$ ; this gives a prime ideal $\\mathfrak r = (x-1,y,5)$ in $B$ containing $\\mathfrak q$ .  Now $\\mathfrak r$ is maximal, and so we are done specializing. So if you have a scheme that is finite type over $\\mathbb Z$ , the closed points will correspond to \n\"actual points\", in Kevin's terminology, but defined over finite fields.  The points of the scheme whose coordinates are integers, say, will not be closed.  One has the choice of thinking them of them as \"actual points\" which nevertheless can be specialized further by reducing modulo primes, or as subvarieties rather than \"actual points\", by identifying them\nwith their Zariski closures (for a picture of this, see the drawing of Mumford that Kevin links to).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem from Liu's book according to the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to know how to show that a quasi-compact scheme X has a closed point. They also ask about the meaning or use of closed points in general schemes, not just algebraic varieties or schemes over a field.\n\nFirst, the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example given shows that each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me parse the original question.\n\nThe problem is in Liu's book. The question states: Let X be a quasi-compact scheme. Show that X contains a closed point. Then there's a second part asking about the meaning/use of closed points in schemes beyond the geometric cases.\n\nBut according to the format, I need to structure only the problem part, filtering out the extra information. The user is asking to present the problem in the Assumption and Problem format. The extra discussion about the meaning of closed points is part of the original question but isn't part of the problem statement itself. So the main problem to structure is \"Let X be a quasi-compact scheme. Show that X contains a closed point.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are that X is a scheme and that X is quasi-compact. Each of these should be separate lines in the Assumption section. The problem is to show that X contains a closed point.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Let X be a quasi-compact scheme. Show that X contains a closed point.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a scheme.\n2. X is quasi-compact.\n\nEach of these is a separate property applied to X. Then the problem is to show that X has a closed point.\n\nSo putting that into the format:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a scheme,\nX is quasi-compact.\n\nProblem:\nShow that X contains a closed point.\n\nThat should be the structured problem. The user's additional question about the meaning/use of closed points is part of their curiosity but isn't part of the problem statement from Liu's book. So we need to filter that out and focus only on the problem they need to solve.\n\nLet me check the example again. In the example, the original problem mentioned that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the example actually shows that the user might have made a mistake. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might have been an error in the example. Wait, let me look again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean no restriction on n. However, the formatted problem in the example adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake in the example. But the user provided that as their example, so perhaps in their example, they intended to restructure a problem where n is divisible by 7. Maybe the original problem was different? Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Anyway, regardless of that example, the key is to follow the instructions given.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is from Liu's book: Let X be a quasi-compact scheme. Show that X contains a closed point. So the assumptions are that X is a scheme and X is quasi-compact. The problem is to show X has a closed point.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure should be:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a scheme,\nX is quasi-compact.\n\nProblem:\nShow that X contains a closed point.\n\nThe user's additional discussion about the meaning of closed points is part of their own curiosity but isn't part of the problem's assumptions or statement. Therefore, it's filtered out as per the instructions.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So \"X is a scheme\" is one line, \"X is quasi-compact\" is another. That's correct. The problem is then to show the existence of a closed point in X.",
