    "Content": "Let $M$ be the space of all $m\\times n$ matrices. And $C=\\{X\\in M|rank(X)\\leq k\\}$ where $k\\leq \\min\\{m,n\\}$. How to proof that C is a closed subset of M?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We can identify $M$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{mn}$, by having the matrix $X=\\pmatrix{a_{11} & \\cdots & a_{1n}\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & \\cdots & a_{mn}}$ correspond to the ordered tuple $(a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{mn})$. Let $r\\leq\\min\\{m,n\\}$, and let $M_r$ be the space of all $r\\times r$ matrices. The map that sends an $m\\times n$ matrix $X\\in M$ to the $r\\times r$ matrix formed from $X$ by removing all but a certain choice of $r$ rows (the $i_1,\\ldots,i_r$'th rows, say) and a certain choice of $r$ columns (the $j_1,\\ldots,j_r$'th colums, say),\n$$X=\\pmatrix{a_{11} & \\cdots & a_{1n}\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & \\cdots & a_{mn}}\\mapsto \\pmatrix{a_{i_1j_1} & \\cdots & a_{j_1j_r}\\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{i_rj_1} & \\cdots & a_{i_rj_r}}$$\ncorresponds to the map from $\\mathbb{R}^{mn}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{r^2}$ that sends\n$$(a_{11},a_{12},\\ldots,a_{mn})\\mapsto (a_{i_1j_1},a_{i_1j_2},\\ldots,a_{i_rj_r}),$$\nwhich is continuous, for any choice of the $i$'s and $j$'s. Furthermore, the determinant map from $M_r$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ that sends $Y\\in M_r$ to $\\det(Y)$ is continuous, because it is a polynomial in the entries of $Y$, i.e. it corresponds to a map from $\\mathbb{R}^{r^2}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ that is a polynomial in $r^2$ variables. Suppose $k<\\min\\{m,n\\}$. Then map $M$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d={\\binom{m}{k+1}\\cdot\\binom{n}{k+1}}$, by sending a matrix to the ordered tuple of its $(k+1)\\times(k+1)$ minors . For example, if $m=n=3$ and $k=1$, then we send $$\\pmatrix{1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6\\\\ 7 & 8 & 9}\\mapsto\\left( |\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 2\\\\ 4 & 5\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 3\\\\ 4 & 6\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 & 3\\\\ 5 & 6\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 2\\\\ 7 & 8\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 3\\\\ 7 & 9\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 & 3\\\\ 8 & 9\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 4 & 5\\\\ 7 & 8\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 4 & 6\\\\ 7 & 9\\end{smallmatrix}|,\n|\\begin{smallmatrix} 5 & 6\\\\ 8 & 9\\end{smallmatrix}| \\right).$$ Because all $d$ of the projection maps from $M$ to $M_r$ are continuous, and because the determinant map from $M_r$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous, this map is continuous. A matrix is of rank $\\leq k$, i.e. $< k+1$, if and only if all of its $(k+1)\\times(k+1)$ minors are zero. Thus, $C$ is the preimage of $0\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ under a continuous map, and $\\{0\\}$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ because $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is Hausdorff, so therefore $C$ is a closed set in $M$. If $k=\\min\\{m,n\\}$, then $C=M$, and is a closed set.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"How to prove that the collection of rank-k matrices forms a closed subset of the space of matrices?\" and the question body elaborates by defining M as the space of all m×n matrices and C as the set of matrices with rank at most k, where k is less than or equal to the minimum of m and n. The task is to prove that C is a closed subset of M.\n\nNow, according to the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, restate the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions from the problem statement. The space M consists of all m×n matrices. Then, C is the subset of M where each matrix X in C has rank(X) ≤ k. The value of k is given such that k ≤ min{m, n}. Each of these points should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n2. k is an integer such that k ≤ min{m, n}. (Here, combining \"k ≤ min{m,n}\" into one assumption as it's a single condition on k.)\n3. C is a subset of M where each matrix X in C satisfies rank(X) ≤ k.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, in the current problem, the user didn't specify whether m and n are integers, but since we're talking about matrices, m and n are positive integers. However, the problem as stated might not explicitly mention that m and n are integers. But in mathematical contexts, the dimensions of matrices are understood to be positive integers. Should I include that as an assumption?\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about an integer n, and in the formatted version, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\", then \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So in that case, they split into two lines. Here, in this problem, m and n are matrix dimensions, so they must be positive integers. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state this; it's implied. Should I include \"m and n are positive integers\" as an assumption? The example didn't include such implicit assumptions. For example, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem listed that n is an integer. But in this current problem, the original question just says \"m×n matrices\" without specifying m and n are integers, but in reality, they are. However, since the problem didn't explicitly state that, perhaps I shouldn't add assumptions that aren't in the original problem. The problem as written doesn't mention that m and n are integers; it's part of the definition of matrices. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n2. k is an integer satisfying k ≤ min{m, n}.\n3. C is the subset of M where each matrix X has rank at most k.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"k ≤ min{m,n}\", so k is an integer here. Since rank is an integer, and k is specified as an integer. But the original problem didn't state that k is an integer. Wait, the original problem says \"where k ≤ min{m,n}\". Is k assumed to be an integer here? Because rank is an integer, so if k is a bound on rank, then k should be a non-negative integer. But the problem statement doesn't explicitly say that. However, in standard contexts, k would be an integer. So perhaps this is an assumption to include. So, the user's original question says \"k ≤ min{m,n}\" but doesn't state that k is an integer. However, since the problem is about rank, which is integer-valued, k must be an integer. Therefore, the formatted assumptions should include that k is an integer. So, line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n- k is an integer.\n- k satisfies k ≤ min{m, n}.\n- C is the subset of M consisting of matrices X with rank(X) ≤ k.\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question says \"C = {X ∈ M | rank(X) ≤ k}\" where k ≤ min{m,n}. So the key conditions are that M is the space of m×n matrices, k is at most the minimum of m and n, and C is the set of matrices with rank at most k. The integer nature of k is implied by the rank being an integer, but perhaps the original problem doesn't state it. However, in mathematical literature, when discussing rank, k is usually an integer. To be safe, perhaps include \"k is an integer\" as an assumption, even if the original problem didn't explicitly state it, because otherwise the set C doesn't make sense if k is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n2. k is an integer.\n3. k ≤ min{m, n}.\n4. C is the subset of M where each matrix X has rank(X) ≤ k.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem is to prove that C is a closed subset of M.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"k ≤ min{m,n}\" but didn't mention k being an integer. However, in the example given by the user, they included \"$n$ is an integer\" even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that case, the original problem stated n is integer, so they included it. Here, the original problem didn't state that k is an integer, but we have to infer it. Since the rank is an integer, and k is a bound on the rank, k must be an integer. Therefore, it's a necessary assumption. Therefore, even if the original problem didn't state it, we should include it as an assumption. Otherwise, the set C is not well-defined. For example, if k is not an integer, say k=2.5, then rank(X) ≤ 2.5 would imply rank(X) ≤ 2, but in that case, the problem would need to state k is an integer. So to be precise, the assumptions should include that k is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n- k is an integer.\n- k is less than or equal to the minimum of m and n.\n- C is the subset of M consisting of matrices X with rank at most k.\n\nProblem:\nProve that C is a closed subset of M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combine \"k is an integer\" and \"k ≤ min{m,n}\" into one line? But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So in the example, \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" are separate. Therefore, \"k is an integer\" and \"k ≤ min{m,n}\" should be separate.\n\nAnother point: in the original problem, the user wrote \"C = {X ∈ M | rank(X) ≤ k}\" where k ≤ min{m,n}. So maybe the assumption is that k is chosen such that it's within the possible ranks of the matrices. However, in the problem statement, they just say k ≤ min{m,n}, but min{m,n} is the maximum possible rank for an m×n matrix. So if k is less than or equal to that, then C would include all matrices with rank up to k, which is possible. So in the assumptions, we need to specify that k is an integer (since rank is integer) and that k is ≤ min{m,n}.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n- k is an integer.\n- k satisfies k ≤ min{m, n}.\n- C is the subset of M where each matrix X has rank(X) ≤ k.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then, the problem is to prove that C is closed in M.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote \"C = {X ∈ M | rank(X) ≤ k}\" where k ≤ min{m,n}. So they have already defined C in terms of M, k, and the rank condition. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. M is the space of m×n matrices.\n2. k is an integer such that k ≤ min{m,n}.\n3. C is defined as {X ∈ M | rank(X) ≤ k}.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should be one line. So splitting the second assumption into \"k is an integer\" and \"k ≤ min{m,n}\".\n\nAlternatively, if the problem states \"k ≤ min{m,n}\", and given that min{m,n} is a number (assuming m and n are positive integers), but the problem might not specify m and n's nature. However, in the context of matrices, m and n are positive integers. So perhaps the first assumption is \"M is the space of m×n matrices, where m and n are positive integers.\" Then the next assumption is \"k is an integer\", then \"k ≤ min{m,n}\", then \"C is the subset...\".\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state that m and n are positive integers. However, matrices are defined with positive integer dimensions. Therefore, m and n being positive integers is implicit. But since the problem didn't state it, should I include it? The example given by the user included \"n is an integer\" because the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So in this problem, if the original question doesn't mention m and n being integers, perhaps we shouldn't include it. So perhaps stick to the given information.\n\nThe original question says: \"Let M be the space of all m×n matrices. And C={X∈M | rank(X)≤k} where k ≤ min{m,n}. How to proof that C is a closed subset of M?\"\n\nTherefore, given that, the assumptions are:\n\n- M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n- k is an integer (implied because rank is integer, but original problem didn't state it; need to check if necessary).\nWait, the problem didn't state that k is an integer, but when they write \"rank(X) ≤ k\", since rank is an integer, k must be an integer. Otherwise, the set C would be ill-defined. For example, if k=2.3, then rank(X) ≤ 2.3 would mean rank(X) ≤2, but the problem should specify k as integer. Therefore, even if the original problem didn't state it, to make the problem well-defined, we need to assume k is integer. Therefore, in the formatted assumptions, we should include \"k is an integer\".\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n1. M is the space of all m×n matrices.\n2. k is an integer.\n3. k satisfies k ≤ min{m, n}.\n4. C is the subset of M consisting of matrices X with rank(X) ≤ k.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Then the problem is to prove C is closed in M.\n\nYes, this seems accurate. The problem didn't state that k is an integer, but since it's bounding the rank, which is an integer, we must include that k is integer as an assumption. Otherwise, the set C is not properly defined. So in the formatted problem, we list each assumption line by line.\n\nNow, check the example given by the user. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was translated into \"n is an integer\". Similarly, here, even though the original problem didn't explicitly state that k is an integer, because rank is integer, we need to include \"k is an integer\" as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $M$ is the space of all $m \\times n$ matrices.\n- $k$ is an integer.\n- $k \\leq \\min\\{m, n\\}$.\n- $C$ is the subset of $M$ consisting of matrices $X$ with $\\text{rank}(X) \\leq k$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $C$ is a closed subset of $M$.\n\nI think this captures all necessary assumptions and states the problem clearly.
