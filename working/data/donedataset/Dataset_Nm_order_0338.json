    "Content": "If $p,q$ are positive quantities and $0 \\leq m\\leq 1$ then Prove that $$(p+q)^m \\leq p^m+q^m$$ Trial: For $m=0$, $(p+q)^0=1 < 2= p^0+q^0$ and for $m=1$, $(p+q)^1=p+q =p^1+q^1$. So, For $m=0,1$ the inequality is true.How I show that the inequality is also true for $0 < m < 1$. Please help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $m=1-n$, where $n \\in [0,1]$. Then $(p+q)^m = (p+q)^{1-n} = p (p+q)^{-n} + q (p+q)^{-n} \\leq p p^{-n} + q q^{-n} = p^m + q^m$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem properly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to their specified example. The original problem is about proving the inequality \\((p + q)^m \\leq p^m + q^m\\) given certain conditions on \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(m\\).\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question states: \"If \\(p, q\\) are positive quantities and \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\), then prove that \\((p + q)^m \\leq p^m + q^m\\).\" So, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. \\(p\\) is a positive quantity.\n2. \\(q\\) is a positive quantity.\n3. \\(m\\) is a real number between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n\nEach assumption should be listed line by line, addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement then needs to be restated concisely. The trial part in the original question gives some cases for \\(m = 0\\) and \\(m = 1\\), but the user specifically asks about \\(0 < m < 1\\). However, in the problem statement, we should include the entire original inequality without referencing specific cases unless they are part of the problem's conditions. Since the example provided in the user's instruction didn't include the trial part in the formatted problem, I should exclude that here as well.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem mentioned divisibility by 91, but the assumption listed was that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. However, in the problem statement, it was still \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps the assumptions include specific conditions that might not be explicitly stated in the problem but are derived from the context. Wait, in that example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe user's example:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer \\(n\\), the number  \n\\(A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)\\)  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n\\(n\\) is an integer,\n\\(n\\) is divisible by 7.\nProblem:\nProve that \\(A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)\\) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer \\(n\\)\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that \\(n\\) is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the example. However, perhaps the user intended to show how to extract specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants the current problem to follow the same structure. Hmm. But in the current problem, the original assumptions are clear: \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are positive, and \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\). So in this case, the assumptions should be those three points. There's no hidden condition here. The user's trial part is the user's attempt, which isn't part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are:\n\n1. \\(p\\) is a positive real number.\n2. \\(q\\) is a positive real number.\n3. \\(m\\) is a real number such that \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\).\n\nThe problem is to prove that \\((p + q)^m \\leq p^m + q^m\\).\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like an error. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But since I need to follow the user's instruction, perhaps I should list all the given conditions as separate assumptions. In the current problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: If \\(p, q\\) are positive quantities and \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\), then Prove that \\((p + q)^m \\leq p^m + q^m\\).\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are positive (each is a separate assumption)\n- \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\) (but this is a single condition on \\(m\\))\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So the three assumptions would be:\n\n1. \\(p\\) is a positive quantity.\n2. \\(q\\) is a positive quantity.\n3. \\(m\\) satisfies \\(0 \\leq m \\leq 1\\).\n\nThat's three separate assumptions. Then the problem statement is to prove the inequality.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\\(p\\) is a positive quantity,\n\\(q\\) is a positive quantity,\n\\(m\\) is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).\nProblem:\nProve that \\((p + q)^m \\leq p^m + q^m\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's trial part in the original question discusses specific cases (m=0 and m=1), but those are part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem statement itself doesn't require those cases to be included as separate assumptions because the inequality is supposed to hold for all \\(m\\) in [0,1], so the main assumption is that \\(m\\) is in that interval. The positivity of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are separate assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions as above.",
