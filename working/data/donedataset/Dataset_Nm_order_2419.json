    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into their specified format. The original problem is about showing that the sum (1/F₁ + 2/F₂ + ... + n/Fₙ) is less than 13, where Fₙ is the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions that Fₙ is the Fibonacci number with F₁ = F₂ = 1, and the recurrence relation Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂. Also, they provided the closed-form expression using Binet's formula. The user example split each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one property.\n\nSo, the assumptions should include:\n\n1. Fₙ is the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. F₁ = 1.\n3. F₂ = 1.\n4. For n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n5. Closed-form expression: Fₙ = [ ( (1+√5)/2 )ⁿ - ( (1-√5)/2 )ⁿ ] / √5.\n\nThe problem statement is to show the sum is less than 13. Wait, the original problem says \"show that ... <13\" without any specific n. But the example given in the user's example had \"for every integer n\", but here it's unclear. Wait, the original question's title says \"show that ... <13\" but doesn't specify for all n or a particular n. The problem might be missing that. But according to the problem as presented, the user wrote \"show that ... <13\". However, in the problem statement on Math Stack Exchange, sometimes people might forget to specify, but usually such sums would be for all positive integers n. So maybe the assumption is missing that n is a positive integer. But the user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this case, maybe the assumption should also include that n is a positive integer. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Let Fₙ is Fibonacci number,ie.(Fₙ=Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, F₁=F₂=1) show that (sum from k=1 to n of k/Fₖ) <13\". So they just say \"show that the sum is less than 13\", but not for what n. It's possible that the problem is to show that for all positive integers n, the sum is less than 13. So the user might need to include that n is a positive integer as an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- Fₙ is the Fibonacci sequence.\n- F₁ = 1.\n- F₂ = 1.\n- For n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n- The closed-form expression for Fₙ is given as [φⁿ - ψⁿ]/√5, where φ=(1+√5)/2 and ψ=(1-√5)/2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question might not specify that the inequality holds for all n. But in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, in this problem, the user's example's formatted version included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (the example's original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption). Wait, no, looking back, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Wait, the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem was for all integers, but the formatted version added an extra assumption. But maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Hmm, perhaps the user intended to show that under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the example might have been a misapplication. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example as given. So the user's example included filtering out some info and listing assumptions, even if the original problem's assumptions might differ. So perhaps in their example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it. But that would be a mistake. However, the user provided that example, so maybe I need to follow that structure. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in their example. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" So the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the user intended to restructure a different problem but made a mistake. But regardless, I need to structure the current problem according to the user's instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says \"show that [sum] <13\". It doesn't specify for all n or for a specific n. But the Fibonacci sequence is defined for positive integers n, so n is a positive integer. Thus, in the assumptions, we should include that n is a positive integer. So the problem is to show that for every positive integer n, the sum is less than 13.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Fₙ is the Fibonacci sequence.\n- F₁ = 1.\n- F₂ = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n- The closed-form expression of Fₙ is given as [φⁿ - ψⁿ]/√5, where φ = (1 + √5)/2 and ψ = (1 - √5)/2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nThen the problem statement is to show that the sum from k=1 to n of (k/Fₖ) is less than 13.\n\nNow, the user's example split each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet point here should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nAssumption:\nFₙ is the Fibonacci sequence,\nF₁ = 1,\nF₂ = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂,\nFₙ has the closed-form expression Fₙ = [ ((1 + √5)/2 )ⁿ - ((1 - √5)/2 )ⁿ ] / √5,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\dfrac{1}{F_{1}}+\\dfrac{2}{F_{2}}+\\cdots+\\dfrac{n}{F_{n}}<13.$$\n\nBut wait, the original problem includes the closed-form expression and the expression for n/Fₙ. Should those be included as separate assumptions? Let's check the user's example: in their example, they included the closed-form expression as part of the problem statement, but in the formatted problem, the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem restated the expression.\n\nIn this case, the problem gives the closed-form expression, so that's a given. So the user included the closed-form in the assumptions. The user's example included the closed-form expression in the problem statement. Wait, in the user's example, the original problem included the closed-form expression, but in the formatted problem, it's part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem's problem section restates A(n) with the expression. So in this case, maybe the closed-form expression is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. But the original problem's question mentions the closed-form expression. The user example included the closed-form in the problem statement. Let me check again:\n\nIn the user's example, the original problem had the closed-form expression, and the formatted problem's problem section includes A(n) = 5^n(...). So the closed-form is part of the problem statement, not the assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question includes two displayed equations: one for Fₙ as the closed-form, and another for n/Fₙ. However, the user (the asker on Math SE) mentions that they used the closed-form and got stuck. So in the problem statement, the closed-form is given as part of the problem's premises. Therefore, in the assumptions, we should include the closed-form expression as an assumption, since it's given.\n\nHence, the closed-form expression of Fₙ is part of the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- Fₙ is the Fibonacci sequence.\n- F₁ = 1.\n- F₂ = 1.\n- For each integer n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n- The closed-form expression of Fₙ is [φⁿ - ψⁿ]/√5, where φ = (1 + √5)/2 and ψ = (1 - √5)/2.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Show that the sum from k=1 to n of (k/Fₖ) is less than 13.\n\nI think that's correct. The closed-form is part of the given information, so it's an assumption. Also, the problem statement includes the Fibonacci recurrence and initial terms, so those are separate assumptions.\n\nNow, checking if each assumption is one property applied to one object. Each line addresses a single condition. For example, \"F₁ = 1\" is one property applied to F₁. Similarly, \"For each integer n ≥ 3, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂\" is one recurrence relation applied to Fₙ. The closed-form expression is another property of Fₙ. And n being a positive integer is a condition on n.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should look like that.",
