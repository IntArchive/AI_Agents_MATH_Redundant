    "Content": "I'm trying to prove the following: If $(a_n)$ is a sequence of positive numbers such that $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n b_n<\\infty$ for all sequences of positive numbers $(b_n)$ such that $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n^2<\\infty$, then $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^2 <\\infty$. The context here is functional analysis homework, in the subject of Hilbert spaces. Here's what I've thought: Let $f=(a_n)>0$. Then the problem reads: if $\\int f\\overline{g}<\\infty$ for all $g>0,g\\in \\ell^2$, then $f\\in \\ell^2$. This brings the problem into the realm of $\\ell^p$ spaces. I know the inner product is defined only in $\\ell^2$, but it's sort of like saying: if $\\langle f,g\\rangle <\\infty$ for all $g>0,g\\in \\ell^2$ then $f\\in \\ell^2$. I read this as: \"to check a positive sequence is in $\\ell^2$, just check its inner product with any positive sequence in $\\ell^2$ is finite, then you're done\", which I find nice, but I can't prove it :P From there, I don't know what else to do. I thought of Hölder's inequality which in this context states:\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_nb_n \\leq \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^2 \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty b_n^2 \\right)^{1/2}$$ but it's not useful here.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Following the idea left by david as an answer, I'll post a detailed solution. Let $T_n:\\ell^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}, T_n(c)=\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j c_j$. Then clearly $T_n \\in (\\ell^2)^*$ for every $n$. I claim that for every $c\\in \\ell^2$, the limit $\\lim_n T_n(c)=\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty a_jc_j$ exists. Indeed, we know it does for $c\\in \\ell^2$ such that $c(n)\\geq 0$ for all $n$. But then, for an arbitrary $c\\in \\ell^2$, we can decompose $c$ as: $c=(\\mbox{Re }  c)^+ - (\\mbox{Re } c)^- + i\\left( (\\mbox{Im }c)^+ - (\\mbox{Im } c)^-\\right)$ which proves the claim. As a consequence we have that $\\sup_n \\lVert T_n(c) \\rVert <\\infty$ for all $c\\in \\ell^2$, but then by the uniform boundedness principle, $\\sup_n \\lVert T_n \\rVert <\\infty$. Now, $T_n(c) = \\langle c, a^{(n)}\\rangle_{\\ell^2}$ where $a^{(n)}(j)=\\begin{cases} a_j & \\mbox{if }j\\leq n \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{if } j>n \\end{cases}$. By Riesz' representation theorem on Hilbert spaces, we know that $\\lVert T_n \\rVert = \\lVert a^{(n)}\\rVert_2= \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^n a_j^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. To conclude, since $a_n\\geq 0$ for all $n$, we have that $\\left( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sup_n \\lVert a^{(n)} \\rVert_2 = \\sup_n \\lVert T_n \\rVert < \\infty$, and then $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^2 <\\infty$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. So the user is asking about a sequence (a_n) of positive numbers. The condition is that for every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers that's in l^2 (so the sum of b_n squared is finite), the sum of a_n b_n is finite. They need to prove that under these conditions, (a_n) must itself be in l^2, meaning the sum of a_n squared is finite.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Let's see. The original problem states that (a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers. That's one assumption. Then, for all sequences (b_n) of positive numbers in l^2, the series sum a_n b_n converges. That's another assumption. The problem is to prove that sum a_n^2 is finite. So breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. (a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers. So each a_n > 0.\n2. For every sequence (b_n) where each b_n is positive and sum b_n^2 < ∞, the sum sum a_n b_n is finite.\n\nWait, does the problem specify that (b_n) are positive? The original question says \"sequences of positive numbers (b_n)\". So yes, (b_n) must be positive. So that's part of the assumption for all such (b_n). So I should note that each b_n is positive as part of the assumptions. However, since the problem is about the universal quantification over all such (b_n), maybe that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption on (a_n). Hmm.\n\nThe user also mentions that they thought about Hölder's inequality but it wasn't helpful. So maybe the approach is to use some duality in l^p spaces. Since l^2 is a Hilbert space, the dual space is itself. So if the functional defined by (a_n) is bounded on l^2, then by Riesz representation theorem, (a_n) must be in l^2. But the user might not be familiar with that. Alternatively, maybe use the contrapositive: suppose (a_n) is not in l^2, then construct a (b_n) in l^2 such that sum a_n b_n diverges.\n\nBut the key assumptions here are: (a_n) is a positive sequence, and for every positive (b_n) in l^2, sum a_n b_n is finite. The problem is to show sum a_n^2 is finite.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the required format:\n\nAssumptions should list all the conditions applied to the objects. Each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n(a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers,\nFor every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers with sum_{n=1}^∞ b_n^2 < ∞, the sum sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n b_n is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n^2 < ∞.\n\nWait, but in the example given, they didn't include the universal quantification in the assumptions. Let me check the example again. The original problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumption had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user stated \"for every integer n\", so that's part of the problem's universal condition, but in the formatted example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the \"for every (b_n) in l^2\" is part of the problem's condition, but in the assumptions, we have that (a_n) is positive, and for all such (b_n) (positive, l^2), sum a_n b_n is finite. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- (a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers.\n- For all sequences (b_n) of positive numbers with sum b_n^2 < ∞, sum a_n b_n < ∞.\n\nBut the problem is to prove sum a_n^2 < ∞. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions given on (a_n) and the quantifications over (b_n). But the example's assumption included a condition on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Wait, but in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that's different. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is a different problem. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem in the example:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number  \nA(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n)  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake in the example. Because the original problem's assumption is n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So maybe the example is wrong. Therefore, perhaps when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include all the conditions given in the problem, and not add new ones. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- (a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers.\n- For every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers with sum b_n^2 < ∞, sum a_n b_n < ∞.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove sum a_n^2 < ∞.\n\nSo translating that into the format:\n\nAssumption:\n(a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers,\nFor every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers with sum_{n=1}^∞ b_n^2 < ∞, the sum sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n b_n is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n^2 < ∞.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they split the assumptions into separate lines for each condition. So here, each assumption line should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nFirst assumption: (a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers.\n\nSecond assumption: For every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers with sum_{n=1}^∞ b_n^2 < ∞, the sum sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n b_n is finite.\n\nBut the second assumption is a universal statement. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So similarly, here, the first is about (a_n), the second is about the relation between (a_n) and all (b_n) in l^2 positive. So that seems acceptable.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n(a_n) is a sequence of positive numbers,\nFor every sequence (b_n) of positive numbers with sum_{n=1}^∞ b_n^2 < ∞, the sum sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n b_n is finite.\n\nProblem:\nProve that sum_{n=1}^∞ a_n^2 < ∞.\n\nI think that's correct. The key is that all the given conditions in the problem are listed as assumptions, each on a separate line, addressing one property. The problem is then the conclusion to be proven.",
