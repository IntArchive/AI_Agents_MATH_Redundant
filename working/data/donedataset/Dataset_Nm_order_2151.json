I've looked at other questions on the site but from the ones I've seen, the $n^2$ term always seems to cancel out, making it simpler.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The original question is about proving a limit using the epsilon-delta definition. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states the limit as n approaches infinity of (8n² -5)/(4n² +7) equals 2. To use the epsilon-delta definition for sequences, which is actually the epsilon-N definition, the main assumptions would relate to n being a natural number approaching infinity. But the problem doesn't specify any particular constraints on n beyond it being in the domain of the function, which is all sufficiently large integers.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the limit is as n approaches infinity, so n is a positive integer going to infinity. But the problem doesn't state any specific conditions on n other than being large enough. So maybe the assumptions here are that n is a positive integer and we need to find an N such that for all n ≥ N, the expression is less than epsilon. However, the user's format requires each assumption to address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" But in the current problem, there's no divisibility condition. The key assumptions here are that n is a natural number (since we're dealing with sequences), and perhaps that the limit is considered as n approaches infinity. But in the epsilon-N definition, the main assumption is that epsilon is a positive real number, and we need to find N such that for all n ≥ N, the inequality holds. However, the user wants assumptions listed line by line for the problem. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. epsilon is a positive real number.\n2. n is a natural number.\n3. N is an integer such that N > sqrt(19/(4epsilon)).\n\nWait, but the problem statement might not explicitly state those. The original problem says \"using the epsilon-delta definition,\" but for sequences, it's epsilon-N. The user's example had assumptions related to the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). In this problem, the main variable is n approaching infinity. So perhaps the assumptions are that n is an integer and n is positive, since the limit is as n approaches infinity. But the problem doesn't specify, but in the context of sequences, n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the original problem's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem didn't state it explicitly. The user's formatted example included that assumption. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be that n is an integer and perhaps that n is positive. However, the problem as stated in the question doesn't mention any specific conditions on n other than being in the context of a limit as n approaches infinity. But to apply the epsilon-N definition, n is assumed to be a natural number (or positive integer). So I should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nepsilon is a positive real number.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the limit using epsilon-N. The key elements here are that epsilon is given positive, and we need to find N such that for all n ≥ N, the inequality holds. But the problem itself doesn't state any restrictions on n beyond being in the domain (n is a positive integer). So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- epsilon is a positive real number.\n\nBut in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't mention the divisibility condition. Wait, looking back, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", so the user correctly listed \"n is an integer\". Then, in the formatted problem, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's not part of the original problem. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless there was a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the user made an error in the example. Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires that n satisfies some divisibility conditions, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the example is wrong. But the user provided it as their own example, so maybe they intended that. However, in the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per their format, based on their example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's example had added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That's confusing. So perhaps in the user's format, the assumptions are not just from the problem but also any implicit conditions. But in the case of the limit problem, the main assumptions would be that n is a positive integer (since it's a sequence), and epsilon is positive. But maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumptions beyond what's given. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to list the conditions that are used in the solution. For example, in the user's solution attempt, they bound the expression by 19/(4n²) and set that less than epsilon, leading to n > sqrt(19/(4epsilon)). So the assumption would be that n is an integer greater than sqrt(19/(4epsilon)).\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, the formatted problem also included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, but that's not in the original problem. That suggests that the user might have made a mistake in their example, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example was structured for a different problem. But given that, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe original problem is to prove the limit using the epsilon-delta (epsilon-N) definition. The problem as stated in the question is to show that the limit of (8n²-5)/(4n²+7) as n approaches infinity is 2. The user's solution attempt starts by manipulating the expression and arrives at needing n to be greater than sqrt(19/(4epsilon)).\n\nIn the epsilon-N definition, the assumptions are that epsilon is any positive real number, and we need to find N such that for all n >= N, the inequality holds. The key assumptions here would be:\n\n- epsilon is a positive real number.\n- n is a positive integer (since we're dealing with a sequence).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention that n is a positive integer; it's implied by the context of the limit as n approaches infinity. However, in the example provided by the user, they included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem didn't state that (the example original problem said \"for every integer n\"). So following that, here the assumption would be that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about the limit of a sequence, which by definition is for n in the natural numbers. So in the assumptions, we should include that n is a positive integer. Additionally, the epsilon is given as a positive real number. However, the user's example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the user's format, all the conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold are listed, including any that are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the limit is as n approaches infinity, so n is taken to be sufficiently large. The key assumptions needed for the proof are:\n\n1. epsilon is a positive real number.\n2. n is a positive integer.\n3. N is an integer greater than sqrt(19/(4epsilon)).\n\nWait, but N is part of the solution, not the problem's assumption. The problem's assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem statement. The problem statement is to prove the limit using the epsilon-N definition, so the only assumptions would be those inherent to the problem: that we're dealing with a sequence (n is a positive integer) and epsilon > 0. The rest (like N) are part of the proof, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- epsilon is a positive real number.\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly state that n is a positive integer, but in the context of a sequence limit, it's implied. However, the user's example included assumptions even if they were part of the original problem's universal quantification. So following that pattern, the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption:\nepsilon is a positive real number,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{8n^2-5}{4n^2+7} = 2$$ using the epsilon-N definition.\n\nBut wait, the user's example included the divisibility condition which wasn't in the original problem. Maybe that was an error. In the current problem, the original question doesn't have any hidden assumptions; it's a straightforward limit. So the only assumptions are that epsilon is positive and n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem should list those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. But according to the user's example, they extracted assumptions even from the original problem's universal statement. For example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, which applies to n being a positive integer (in the context of sequences). So the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. Additionally, since we're using the epsilon-N definition, epsilon is a positive real number. So:\n\nAssumption:\nepsilon is a positive real number,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{8n^2-5}{4n^2+7} = 2$$ using the epsilon-N definition.\n\nBut in the user's solution attempt, they derived N as sqrt(19/(4epsilon)), which requires n >= N. But the problem's assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not the solution's steps. So the assumptions should be the given conditions, not the derived ones. Hence, the correct assumptions are epsilon > 0 and n is a positive integer. The rest (like N being greater than sqrt(...)) is part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nepsilon is a positive real number,\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{8n^2-5}{4n^2+7} = 2$$ using the epsilon-N definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require listing epsilon as an assumption, because it's part of the definition. But the user's example included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so similarly, here the problem uses epsilon in the definition, so listing epsilon > 0 as an assumption makes sense.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach.",
