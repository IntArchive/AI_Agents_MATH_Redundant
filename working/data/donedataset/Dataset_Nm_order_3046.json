    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"How prove this $\\int_{a}^{b}[f''(x)]^2dx\\ge\\dfrac{4}{b-a}$\"\n\nThe question body states: Let $f$ on $[a,b]$ two continuously differentiable functions, such that $$f(a)=f(b)=0, f'(a)=1, f'(b)=0, b>a>0$$ Show that $$\\int_{a}^{b}[f''(x)]^2dx\\ge\\dfrac{4}{b-a}$$\n\nThen the user mentions some ideas involving Cauchy-Schwarz and integrating by parts, but gets stuck on finding the appropriate $g(x)$.\n\nAlright, so the task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let me start by listing all the given conditions.\n\nFirst, the function $f$ is defined on the interval $[a, b]$. The problem states that $f$ is two times continuously differentiable. So that's one assumption: $f$ is twice continuously differentiable on $[a, b]$.\n\nNext, the boundary conditions: $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$. These are separate conditions, so each should be its own assumption. Then, the derivatives at the endpoints: $f'(a) = 1$ and $f'(b) = 0$. These are two more assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, the problem specifies that $b > a > 0$. So the interval is such that $b$ is greater than $a$, and both are positive. Since this is two separate conditions (b > a and a > 0), but the user wrote \"b > a > 0\", which implies both, maybe split into two assumptions? Wait, \"b > a\" is one condition and \"a > 0\" is another. However, in the original problem, it's written as a single phrase. Should I split them? Let me check the example provided.\n\nIn the example given, the original problem had \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But in the problem presented here, the user's example didn't split \"b > a > 0\" into separate parts. Wait, no, the example given by the user was the problem where $n$ is an integer, and $n$ is divisible by 7. So each condition is a separate line. Therefore, I should split \"b > a\" and \"a > 0\" into separate assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f$ is twice continuously differentiable on $[a, b]$\n- $f(a) = 0$\n- $f(b) = 0$\n- $f'(a) = 1$\n- $f'(b) = 0$\n- $b > a$\n- $a > 0$\n\nThen, the problem is to show that the integral of $[f''(x)]^2$ from $a$ to $b$ is at least $4/(b - a)$.\n\nLet me check again if all the conditions are covered. The original problem says \"two continuously differentiable functions\". Wait, the original wording says \"let $f$ on $[a,b]$ two continuously differentiable functions,such...\" Hmm, that might be a mistranslation or typo. The correct term is \"twice continuously differentiable\", meaning $f \\in C^2([a, b])$. So probably the user meant \"twice\" instead of \"two\". So that's the first assumption.\n\nYes, so all the conditions are listed. Let me make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem mentions $f'(a) = 1$, $f'(b) = 0$, and $f(a) = f(b) = 0$, along with the interval conditions. So these are all the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as separate points and the problem statement.",
