    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided shows that the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and the formatted version lists assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem in question here is about retracting the Möbius strip to its boundary. The original question says: \"Prove that there is no retraction r: M → S^1 = ∂M where M is the Möbius strip.\" The user tried using the induced homomorphism on fundamental groups but both are Z, so nothing goes wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nSo, for this problem:\n\n1. The Möbius strip M is considered. \n2. The boundary of M is S^1 (∂M = S^1).\n3. There exists a retraction r: M → S^1, which is a continuous function.\n4. The retraction r is constant on the codomain S^1 (meaning r restricted to S^1 is the identity map).\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"there is no retraction\", so the assumptions would be the conditions under which we need to show such a retraction can't exist. So the problem is to show that such a retraction doesn't exist. Therefore, the assumptions are the setup for the problem. \n\nSo, the problem is to prove that no such retraction exists. The assumptions would include that M is the Möbius strip, its boundary is S^1, and a retraction is a continuous map constant on the codomain (but in the case of a retraction, the function must satisfy r|_S^1 = id, right? Because a retraction is a map that restricts to the identity on the subspace. So the retraction r: M → S^1 must satisfy r(x) = x for all x in S^1. \n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- M is the Möbius strip.\n- The boundary of M is ∂M = S^1.\n- A retraction r: M → ∂M is a continuous map.\n- The retraction r satisfies r(x) = x for all x ∈ ∂M.\n\nBut wait, the original problem states \"there is no retraction (i.e., continuous function constant on the codomain)\". Wait, maybe the user's original question has a typo or misunderstanding. Because a retraction is usually a map that is the identity on its image, not constant. If it's constant, then it's a constant map, which is different. But the term \"retraction\" in topology usually means a map r: X → A where A is a subspace of X, such that r(a) = a for all a in A. So if the problem says \"constant on the codomain\", that might be a mistake. The user might have meant that r is the identity on the codomain. \n\nLooking at the original question: \"Prove that there is no retraction (i.e. continuous function constant on the codomain) r: M → S^1 = ∂M where M is the Möbius strip.\" Wait, that's probably a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Because a retraction is not a function constant on the codomain. That would mean that for all y in S^1, r(y) is constant, which is not a retraction. So perhaps the user confused \"constant on the codomain\" with \"identity on the subspace\". \n\nGiven that the user tried using the induced homomorphism between fundamental groups, which are both Z, but didn't find a contradiction. So maybe the actual problem is to show there's no retraction in the standard sense (r is identity on ∂M). Therefore, the assumptions should correct that. But I need to follow the user's original problem statement. However, the user's problem statement might have an error. \n\nBut as per the user's instruction, we need to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. The original problem says: \"Prove that there is no retraction (i.e. continuous function constant on the codomain) r: M → S^1 = ∂M where M is the Möbius strip.\" So according to this, the user defines a retraction as a continuous function constant on the codomain. But that's not the standard definition. Maybe the user meant \"constant on the domain\"? No. Wait, the codomain is S^1. If r is constant on the codomain, that would mean r maps all of M to a single point in S^1, which is a constant function, but that's not a retraction. A retraction should map the boundary to itself identically. So there's confusion here. \n\nBut given the problem as stated by the user, they might have a wrong definition. However, considering that the user tried using fundamental groups and found both are Z, which would be the case for the boundary circle and the Möbius strip's fundamental group. The standard proof uses the fact that the inclusion induces a homomorphism from π1(S^1) to π1(M), which is Z to Z, but multiplication by 2, so if there's a retraction, the composition would be identity, but 2 ≠ 1, leading to a contradiction. \n\nBut perhaps the user's problem statement has a typo. Maybe \"constant on the codomain\" was supposed to be \"identity on the boundary\". So, given that the user's problem might have an error, but we need to structure it as per their input. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant \"r is a continuous function that is the identity on the codomain S^1\". So maybe \"constant on the codomain\" is a mistranslation or misunderstanding. In Vietnamese, \"constant on the codomain\" might translate differently. For example, \"hàm liên tục hằng trên miền đích\" which could be ambiguous. \n\nBut given that the example in the original problem had a mistake (the original problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91=13*7, so maybe the original problem had an error, but the formatted version included that assumption). Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. So perhaps the user is using that example to show how to structure, even if there's an error. Therefore, maybe the task is to process the given problem as stated, even if there's an error. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Prove that there is no retraction (i.e. continuous function constant on the codomain) r: M → S^1 = ∂M where M is the Möbius strip.\" So according to this, a retraction is defined as a continuous function that is constant on the codomain. But the codomain is S^1. So \"constant on the codomain\" would mean that for all y in S^1, r(y) is constant? That doesn't make sense. Or does it mean that r is constant when restricted to the codomain? But the codomain is S^1, and the retraction is supposed to map M to S^1. If it's constant on the codomain, then r(M) is a single point, which is a constant function, which is trivial, but the problem says there's no such retraction. But actually, there are constant functions, so that can't be. Therefore, the user's definition is incorrect. \n\nBut given the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format, perhaps we should correct the definition. But the example provided by the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (adding that n is divisible by 7). Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the user's example is flawed, but we are supposed to follow the structure regardless. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be all the given conditions in the problem. In the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- M is the Möbius strip.\n- The boundary of M is S^1 (∂M = S^1).\n- r: M → S^1 is a retraction, meaning a continuous map such that r(x) = x for all x in ∂M.\n\nBut the user's problem states \"continuous function constant on the codomain\", which is conflicting. So maybe the user intended the standard definition of a retraction, and the \"constant on the codomain\" is a mistranslation. Therefore, to structure the problem correctly, we should note that a retraction is a continuous map r: M → ∂M such that r restricted to ∂M is the identity. \n\nSo, assumptions:\n\n- M is the Möbius strip.\n- The boundary of M is ∂M = S^1.\n- A retraction r: M → ∂M is a continuous function.\n- The retraction r satisfies r(x) = x for all x ∈ ∂M.\n\nProblem: Prove that no such retraction exists.\n\nBut the user's original problem statement says \"constant on the codomain\", which is confusing. But given the user's attempt using induced homomorphisms on fundamental groups, it's clear that the intended problem is about the standard retraction, which requires r to be the identity on ∂M. Therefore, correcting that in the assumptions would be appropriate. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: M is the Möbius strip.\n\nAssumption: The boundary of M is ∂M = S^1.\n\nAssumption: r: M → ∂M is a continuous function.\n\nAssumption: r(x) = x for all x ∈ ∂M.\n\nProblem: Prove that such a retraction r does not exist.\n\nBut the original problem says \"there is no retraction (i.e., continuous function constant on the codomain)\", which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct assumptions should include the standard retraction definition, and the problem is to prove no such retraction exists. Alternatively, if we take the user's definition literally, then the retraction is a constant function, which always exists, so the problem is ill-posed. But since the user mentions using fundamental groups, they must be referring to the standard retraction. \n\nTherefore, despite the user's possibly incorrect phrasing, the correct assumptions should be based on the standard definition. Hence, the formatted problem should list the standard retraction conditions.",
