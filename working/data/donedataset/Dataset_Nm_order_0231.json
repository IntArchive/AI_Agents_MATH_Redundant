    "Content": "Let $K$ be nonsingular symmetric matrix, prove that if $K$ is positive definite so is $K^{-1}$ . My attempt: I have that $K = K^T$ so $x^TKx = x^TK^Tx = (xK)^Tx = (xIK)^Tx$ and then I don't know what to do next.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $K$ is positive definite then $K$ is invertible, so define $y = K x$ . Then $y^T K^{-1} y = x^T K^{T} K^{-1} K x = x^T K^{T} x >0$ . Since the transpose of a positive definite matrix is also positive definite, cf. here , this proves that $K^{-1}$ is positive definite.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that if K is a nonsingular symmetric positive definite matrix, then its inverse K⁻¹ is also positive definite. \n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. A symmetric matrix K is positive definite if for any non-zero vector x, the expression xᵀKx is positive. Also, since K is nonsingular, its inverse exists. The question is about showing that xᵀK⁻¹x is also positive for any non-zero x.\n\nThe user's attempt started by noting that K is symmetric, so K = Kᵀ. Then they tried manipulating xᵀKx but got stuck. Maybe they were trying to relate K⁻¹ to K somehow. \n\nLet me think. One approach could be to use the properties of positive definite matrices. Since K is positive definite and symmetric, we know that all its eigenvalues are positive. The inverse of K would then have eigenvalues that are the reciprocals of K's eigenvalues, which are also positive. Since K⁻¹ is also symmetric (because the inverse of a symmetric matrix is symmetric), having all positive eigenvalues would imply that K⁻¹ is positive definite. That seems like a valid approach using eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more algebraic approach without eigenvalues. Let's consider that since K is positive definite, there exists a Cholesky decomposition K = LLᵀ where L is lower triangular with positive diagonal entries. Then K⁻¹ = (L⁻¹)ᵀL⁻¹. Since L⁻¹ is also invertible, this would mean K⁻¹ is positive definite because it's of the form MMᵀ where M is invertible. But maybe that's a bit advanced.\n\nAnother way: For any non-zero vector x, we need to show xᵀK⁻¹x > 0. Let me set y = K⁻¹x. Then x = Ky. Substitute into xᵀK⁻¹x: yᵀKᵀK⁻¹Ky. Wait, maybe that's not the right substitution. Let me think again. If y = K⁻¹x, then x = Ky. So substitute into xᵀK⁻¹x: (Ky)ᵀK⁻¹(Ky) = yᵀKᵀK⁻¹Ky. Since K is symmetric, Kᵀ = K, so this becomes yᵀKK⁻¹Ky = yᵀK y. But y is non-zero because x is non-zero and K is invertible. Since K is positive definite, yᵀK y > 0. Therefore, xᵀK⁻¹x = yᵀK y > 0. That works! So by substituting y = K⁻¹x, we can relate xᵀK⁻¹x to yᵀK y, which is positive.\n\nWait, but this requires that when x is non-zero, y is non-zero, which is true because K⁻¹ is invertible (since K is nonsingular). So yes, that substitution works. Therefore, xᵀK⁻¹x is positive for any non-zero x, hence K⁻¹ is positive definite.\n\nThe user's original attempt didn't get far, but perhaps they needed to consider substituting variables or using properties of inverses and symmetry. The key step is to relate xᵀK⁻¹x to something involving K and another vector, leveraging the invertibility and symmetry.\n\nSo the problem requires using the definition of positive definiteness, the invertibility of K, and maybe some substitution or eigenvalue approach. The main assumptions are that K is symmetric, nonsingular, and positive definite. The problem is to show K⁻¹ is also positive definite.",
