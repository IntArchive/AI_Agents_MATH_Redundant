    "AcceptedAnswer": "When proving theorems in mathematics, one starts from a set of axioms, statements that are accepted as true without argument. You might ask, \"but what if an axiom isn't true?\", and the answer is that we would be dealing with different mathematics. For example, Euclid included the parallel postulate as an axiom in his elements. For years mathematicians tried to prove that the parallel postulate could be derived from the other axioms. It turns out that if you don't accept the parallel postulate, you end up with different types of geometry that we now call non-euclidean. Einsteins theory of general relativity depends on these geometries. To come up with a proof of such a seemingly simple fact as $2 + 2 = 4$, we need a set of axioms to start with, and we need precise definitions of all the terms we are using. Depending on what set of axioms you start with, proving that $2 + 2 = 4$, and that no other natural number can equal $2+2$ may be either very simple or surprisingly difficult. For example in Russell and Whitehead's Principia , it famously took over 300 pages of work before they could prove that $1+1=2$. They started with a very sparse set of axioms though. The most common set of axioms for the natural numbers are the Peano Axioms . They are $0$ is a natural number. For every natural number $x$, $x=x$. For all natural numbers $x$ and $y$, if $x = y$, then $y = x$. For all natural numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x = y$ and $y = z$, then $x = z$. For all $a$ and $b$, if $a$ is a natural number, and $a = b$, then $b$ is a natural number. For every natural number $n$, $S(n)$ is a natural number. For every natural number $n$, $S(n) = 0$ is false. For all natural numbers $m$ and $n$, if $S(m) = S(n)$ then $m = n$. If $K$ is a set such that $0 \\in K$, and for every natural number $n$, $n \\in K$ implies that $S(n) \\in K$, then $K$ contains all natural numbers. Here $S$ is the successor function, it takes each natural number to its successor.\nThis might seem like a complicated mess compared to the simplicity of natural numbers, but we need to be precise. We need to carefully construct the axioms so that no contradiction can be derived from them, and so they encapsulate what we understand to be the natural numbers. We want to be able to prove interesting statements about the natural numbers from them. Note that the axioms contain undefined terms. The axioms don't need to state what the terms mean, only what they do. The following definitions are commonly used within this axiomatization. They are the definitions from Peano's original paper (An English translation is available in the book From Frege to Gödel ), modified to start at $0$ instead of $1$. $1$ is defined as $S(0)$, $2$ is defined as $S(1)$,\n$3$ is defined as $S(2)$, and $4$ is defined as $S(3)$. Addition is defined\nrecursively as follows. $$a + 0 = a$$\n$$a + S(b) = S(a + b)$$. Thus $$2 + 2 = 2 + S(1) = S(2 + 1) = S(2 + S(0)) = S(S(2 + 0)) = S(S(2)) = S(3) = 4$$ proving that $2+2 = 4$. This is the unique value of $2+2$ by axiom 4. If $x = 2+2$ and $2+2 = 4$, then $x = 4$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nThe problem given here is from the title: \"Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2+2.\" The question mentions it was featured on a comic and someone is looking for a proof. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem seems to be about showing that 4 is the unique solution to the equation 2+2. But wait, 2+2 is straightforward arithmetic. Maybe there's a hidden context here. The comic might be joking about alternative answers, but in standard arithmetic, 2+2 equals 4. The user probably wants to frame this as a mathematical proof problem, perhaps in a specific structure or under certain conditions.\n\nLooking at the example, assumptions were about the properties of n. Here, the equation is 2+2, but to prove 4 is the only solution, maybe there are implicit assumptions. For example, working in base 10, using standard addition, the numbers being integers, etc. Each assumption should be one line, one property applied to one object.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n- The operation is addition in the real numbers.\n- The numbers 2 and 2 are integers.\n- The base of the number system is 10.\n- The solution is sought in the set of real numbers.\n\nBut the problem statement itself is to prove that 4 is the only solution to 2+2. So structuring it, the assumptions would include these conditions. However, the original problem might not specify these, so I need to infer based on standard math context. Since the example included assumptions that were not in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), maybe here the user wants to make explicit the standard assumptions. But in the example, the assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, that example seems off. Wait, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", that's conflicting. Hmm, maybe there was a typo in the example. But the user provided that example, so perhaps they intended to show how to extract assumptions even if the original problem had some implicit ones? Or maybe the example was flawed. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, to structure it, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The operation \"+\" denotes standard addition in the real numbers.\nAssumption: The numbers \"2\" and \"2\" are integers.\nAssumption: The solution is sought in the set of real numbers.\nProblem: Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2 + 2.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context, like modular arithmetic, but the user's example didn't include that. Since the original problem is a joke from a comic, maybe it's a play on different number systems. For example, in base 5, 2+2=4, which is still 4. In base 3, 2+2=11. So maybe the assumption is that the base is 10. But the problem states 4 is the only solution, so maybe the assumption is that the base is greater than 4. But the user might not have that in the original problem. Since the original problem is \"Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2+2\", the key assumptions are the definition of addition and the number system. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where in some algebraic structures 2+2 can have different results, but under standard arithmetic, it's 4. So the assumptions would be the standard arithmetic operations. But how to phrase each as a single line. So:\n\nAssumption: The operation \"+\" is defined as standard addition.\nAssumption: The numbers \"2\" and \"2\" are elements of the set of integers.\nAssumption: The solution is considered within the field of real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2 + 2.\n\nBut I need to ensure each assumption is one line, one property, one object. Maybe the key assumptions here are the definitions of the numbers and the operation. Since without specifying the number system and operation, the problem is ambiguous. So, listing those would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a ring or group where 2 is an element, but in standard math, 2+2=4. So the assumptions would be the standard arithmetic axioms.\n\nBut I need to follow the example's structure. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example had a mistake. But regardless, I need to proceed.\n\nGiven that, for the problem \"Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2+2\", the assumptions would be:\n\n- The symbols \"2\" and \"2\" represent the natural numbers two.\n- The operation \"+\" represents standard addition.\n- The solution is sought in the set of natural numbers.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that 4 is the only solution.\n\nBut maybe the user wants minimal assumptions. Since in standard math, 2+2 is 4, but if you don't assume the number system, it could vary. So, the key assumptions are the number system (like base 10, integers) and the operation.\n\nSo, formatted as:\n\nAssumption: The numbers \"2\" and \"2\" are integers in base 10.\nAssumption: The operation \"+\" is standard addition.\nAssumption: The solution is an integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2 + 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe base 10 isn't necessary. But without specifying the base, the symbols \"2\" and \"4\" could be ambiguous. For example, in base 5, \"4\" is still a valid digit. But in base 3, \"4\" isn't a digit. But the problem mentions 4 as the solution, so maybe assuming base 10 is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of Peano arithmetic, where 2 is S(S(0)) and addition is defined recursively. But that's more formal.\n\nGiven the example provided by the user, where they added assumptions that weren't in the original problem (like n divisible by 7), perhaps here we should list implicit assumptions. The original problem's example added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake, but maybe it's intentional. Wait, looking back, the original example's formatted problem has assumptions that include \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem was to prove for every integer n. That seems contradictory. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. If that's the case, maybe the user intended to have the assistant extract the correct assumptions. But since the user provided that example, maybe they want to follow that structure even if it's incorrect. Therefore, in the current problem, perhaps the assumptions would include something not explicitly stated but necessary. But in this case, the problem is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was a bad example, and the user expects me to correctly structure the problem. For the current problem, \"Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2+2\", the key assumptions are the definitions of the numbers and the addition operation. So:\n\nAssumption: The numbers \"2\" and \"2\" are natural numbers.\nAssumption: The operation \"+\" is defined as standard addition.\nAssumption: The solution is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that 4 is the only solution to 2 + 2.\n\nThat seems reasonable. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The numbers are natural, the operation is standard addition, and the solution is in natural numbers. Therefore, the problem is to show that 4 is the unique result.",
