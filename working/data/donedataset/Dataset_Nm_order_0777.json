    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the expected value of a positive random variable T is equal to the integral of its survival function S(t) from 0 to infinity. Let me start by identifying the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that T is a positive random variable. That's one assumption. Then, they defined S(t) as the probability that T is greater than or equal to t. So, S(t) = P(T ≥ t). That's another assumption because it's defining the survival function. \n\nWait, the problem states \"Prove that E[T] = ∫₀^∞ S(t) dt.\" So, the assumptions are: T is a positive random variable, and S(t) is defined as P(T ≥ t). These need to be listed as separate assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. \n\nLooking back at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the example, both are about n. Here, the two assumptions would be about T and S(t). So, first, T is a positive random variable. Second, S(t) is defined as the probability that T is at least t. Then the problem is to prove the expected value equals the integral of the survival function.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a positive random variable,\nS(t) = P(T ≥ t).\n\nProblem:\nProve that E[T] = ∫₀^∞ S(t) dt.\n\nWait, the original question didn't mention any other conditions, like T being continuous or discrete. But in probability theory, this result holds for any non-negative random variable, whether discrete, continuous, or a mix. However, the survival function approach typically requires that the expectation exists, i.e., E[T] is finite. But maybe that's part of the problem's assumptions? Or is it considered part of the proof? The original problem statement just says T is a positive random variable. So, maybe the only assumptions are T is positive and S(t) is defined as P(T ≥ t). The problem is then to prove the expectation is the integral of the survival function. That seems to align with the example given. The example had two assumptions about n, even though the original problem only mentioned n being an integer. Wait, in the example, the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. Wait, that example seems conflicting. Wait, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there? But regardless, following the user's instructions, the task is to list the assumptions from the problem as given. In the current problem, the user states T is a positive random variable and S(t) = P(T ≥ t). So those are the two assumptions. The problem is to prove E[T] is the integral of S(t). So the formatted answer should list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
