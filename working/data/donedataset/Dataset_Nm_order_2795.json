    "Content": "Prove this: Let $f :[a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded and integrable function. Show that $f^2$ is integrable too. I'm in trouble with this. Can anyone show how to do it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Considering Riemann integrals, you can make the following argument. Notice that if $f$ is bounded with $|f(x)| \\leq B$, then $$|f^2(x) - f^2(y)|= |f(x)-f(y)||f(x)+f(y)|\\leq 2B|f(x)-f(y)|$$ and $$M_j(f^2)-m_j(f^2)=\\sup \\{f^2(x):x_{j-1}\\leq x\\leq x_j\\}-\\inf \\{f^2(x):x_{j-1}\\leq x\\leq x_j\\}\\leq 2B[M_j(f)-m_j(f)]$$ The difference of upper and lower sums for $f^2$ with respect to a partition $P$ is $$U(P,f^2) - L(P,f^2) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}[M_j(f^2)-m_j(f^2)](x_j-x_{j-1}) \\leq 2B[U(P,f) - L(P,f)].$$ Since $f$ is integrable, for any $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists a partition P such that $$U(P,f) - L(P,f) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2B},$$ and $$U(P,f^2) - L(P,f^2) < \\epsilon.$$ Therefore, $f^2$ satisfies the Riemann criterion for integrability.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to prove that if a function f is integrable on [a, b], then f squared is also integrable. The user mentions that f is bounded and integrable, so those are the key assumptions here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the assumptions. The function f is defined from the interval [a, b] to the real numbers. It's stated to be bounded, which means there's some M such that |f(x)| ≤ M for all x in [a, b]. Also, f is integrable on [a, b]. These are the main conditions given.\n\nNow, the problem is to show that f squared, which is f^2, is integrable as well. The user might be confused about how the properties of f (being bounded and integrable) lead to the integrability of its square. They might have tried using the definition of Riemann integrability directly, which can be tricky, or maybe they're not familiar with the criterion involving upper and lower sums or the concept of oscillation.\n\nI remember that one approach to proving that the square of an integrable function is integrable involves using the fact that if a function is integrable and another function is continuous on the range of the first, then the composition is integrable. Since squaring is a continuous function, composing it with f (which is integrable) would give an integrable function. But wait, this requires that f is bounded, which is given here. So that might be a way. Alternatively, using the Riemann condition that the difference between upper and lower sums can be made arbitrarily small. For f^2, we can relate the oscillation of f^2 to the oscillation of f. The oscillation of f^2 over an interval would be bounded by 2M times the oscillation of f over that interval. Since f is integrable, its oscillations can be controlled, hence making f^2 integrable.\n\nBut the user just needs the problem structured, not the solution. So focusing on formatting the problem correctly. The original problem states: Let f: [a,b] → ℝ be bounded and integrable. Show f² is integrable. The assumptions here are that f is defined on [a,b], it's bounded, and it's integrable. Each of these should be separate assumptions. So in the assumption section, each line should list one property applied to one object. The problem is to show f² is integrable.\n\nWait, the example given in the initial instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the assumptions are that f is a function from [a,b] to R, it's bounded, and it's integrable. So three separate assumptions. Each on a separate line. Then the problem is to show f² is integrable. That should be straightforward.",
