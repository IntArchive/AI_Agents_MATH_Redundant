    "Content": "Consider the measurable space $(\\mathbb{R}, \\Sigma)$, where \n$$\\Sigma := \\{ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\,:\\, A \\text{ is countable or } A^c \\text{ is countable}\\}.$$ Proving this is indeed a $\\sigma$-algebra is easy: The countable union of countable sets is again countable; if the countable union contains at least one cocountable set, the coset of this union will be a subset of a countable set and thus countable. Now consider the following map: $$\\mu: \\Sigma \\to [0,\\infty], \\quad A \\mapsto \\begin{cases}0 \\quad \\text{if $A$ is countable} \\\\ 1 \\quad \\text{else}\\end{cases}$$ How would I prove that this map is a measure? Again, if I only consider disjoint unions of countable sets $\\sigma$-additivity is obvious. But what about disjoint unions that contain uncountable sets with countable complement? I suspect that every disjoint union of sets in $\\Sigma$ contains at most one uncountable set with countable coset, but I can't find a rigorous proof for this. The only uncountable sets $A \\in \\Sigma$ with countable coset I can picture at this moment are of the form $$A = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus Q,$$ where $Q \\subset \\mathbb{Q}$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that there are two disjoint uncountable sets $A, B$ with countable complements. Then $\\mathbb{R} = (A\\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c$ would be the union of two countable sets, in contradiction to the uncountability of the real numbers.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into their specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about proving that a certain map μ is a measure on the sigma-algebra Σ, which consists of subsets of ℝ that are either countable or have countable complements. The user mentions that proving Σ is a sigma-algebra is already done, so the focus is on μ being a measure.\n\nThe main issue the user is facing is with σ-additivity, especially when dealing with disjoint unions that include uncountable sets (with countable complements). They suspect that such a union can have at most one uncountable set with a countable complement, which would resolve the problem because μ would just assign 1 to that set and 0 to others, summing to 1. But they need a rigorous proof for this.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's parse the original problem:\n\n1. The measurable space is (ℝ, Σ), where Σ is the collection of subsets A of ℝ such that A is countable or A's complement is countable.\n2. μ is defined as 0 if A is countable and 1 otherwise (i.e., if A is cocountable).\n3. The task is to prove μ is a measure on Σ.\n4. The challenge is handling disjoint unions that might contain uncountable sets with countable complements.\n\nAssumptions should be each condition applied to one object. So:\n\n- The sigma-algebra Σ consists of subsets of ℝ that are countable or have countable complements.\n- μ assigns 0 to countable sets and 1 to cocountable sets.\n\nThe problem is to prove that μ is a measure on Σ. But the key assumption here is the structure of Σ and the definition of μ. Additionally, there's an implicit assumption about disjoint unions in Σ: when taking a disjoint union of sets in Σ, how many of them can be cocountable? The user's intuition is that there can be at most one cocountable set in such a union, which would make μ additive.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is trying to verify that μ is a measure, which requires countable additivity. So the assumptions would include the definition of Σ and μ. Let me list them step by step.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Σ is the collection of subsets A of ℝ where A is countable or A^c is countable.\n- μ: Σ → [0, ∞] maps A to 0 if A is countable, and 1 otherwise.\n\nProblem: Prove that μ is a measure on Σ.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions that when considering disjoint unions, especially those containing uncountable sets (which would be cocountable), there's an issue. The key insight is that in any disjoint family of sets in Σ, at most one can be cocountable. Because if two cocountable sets are disjoint, their complements would both be countable, but the union of their complements would be the complement of their intersection (which is empty since they're disjoint), leading to ℝ being a union of two countable sets, which is impossible. Hence, in any disjoint collection, only one set can be cocountable, and the rest must be countable. Therefore, μ's additivity holds because the sum would be 1 (from the single cocountable set) and the measure of the union would be 1 if the union is cocountable, which it is if exactly one set is cocountable. Otherwise, all sets are countable, so the measure is 0. Therefore, σ-additivity holds.\n\nBut in formatting the problem, do I need to include that assumption about the disjoint union containing at most one cocountable set? Or is that part of the problem to be proven?\n\nLooking at the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem statement, the user had the problem to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the example might be an error. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. The user probably made an error here. Because the original problem doesn't restrict n to multiples of 7. The correct assumptions should just be n is an integer, but in the example, they added an extra assumption. Maybe the user intended to filter out irrelevant info, but in this case, they introduced a new assumption. Hmm. So perhaps the example is not a good one. But regardless, the task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the format.\n\nFor the current problem, the original question is about proving that μ is a measure, and the user's own thoughts mention that in a disjoint union of sets in Σ, there can be at most one cocountable set. So maybe that's a hidden assumption or a lemma needed for the proof.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking to prove μ is a measure. The assumptions are Σ is a sigma-algebra (already given as established), and the definition of μ. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\n- Σ is the sigma-algebra of subsets of ℝ that are countable or have countable complement.\n- μ assigns 0 to countable sets and 1 to cocountable sets.\n\nThe problem is to prove μ is a measure on Σ.\n\nHowever, in the original problem, the user also mentions their suspicion that every disjoint union of sets in Σ contains at most one uncountable set with countable complement. Is this an assumption or part of the problem? The user is asking how to prove μ is a measure, and the key step is proving that in any disjoint countable union, there can be at most one cocountable set, which then makes the measure additive. So perhaps this is part of the problem's reasoning, not an assumption.\n\nTherefore, in structuring the problem, the assumptions are the definition of Σ and μ. The problem is to prove μ is a measure, which inherently requires proving that in any disjoint countable collection, there's at most one cocountable set.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should have the assumptions about Σ and μ, and the problem statement is to prove μ is a measure.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nΣ consists of subsets of ℝ that are countable or have countable complement,\nμ maps countable sets to 0 and cocountable sets to 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that μ is a measure on Σ.\n\nI think that's correct. The user's own thoughts about the disjoint union containing at most one cocountable set are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. The problem is to prove μ is a measure, given the definition of Σ and μ.",
