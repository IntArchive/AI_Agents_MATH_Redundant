    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that an involutory matrix (a matrix where $A=A^{-1}$ ) has only eigenvalues $\\pm 1$ . I've been able to prove that $\\det(A) = \\pm 1$ , but that only shows that the product of the eigenvalues is equal to $\\pm 1$ , not the eigenvalues themselves. Does anybody have an idea for how the proof might go?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about proving that an involutory matrix has eigenvalues of ±1. An involutory matrix is one where A equals its inverse, right? So A = A⁻¹. That means when you multiply A by itself, you get the identity matrix. So A² = I.\n\nAlright, eigenvalues. Remember that if λ is an eigenvalue of A, then for some non-zero vector v, Av = λv. Since A is invertible (because it's its own inverse), all eigenvalues should be non-zero, but we already know the determinant is ±1, which is the product of the eigenvalues. But the question is about each individual eigenvalue being ±1.\n\nLet me think. If A² = I, then applying A twice to the eigenvector v gives A²v = Iv = v. But also, A²v = A(Av) = A(λv) = λ(Av) = λ²v. So from A²v = v and A²v = λ²v, we get that λ²v = v. Since v is non-zero, λ² must equal 1. Therefore, λ² = 1 implies λ = ±1. That seems straightforward. Did I miss something here? The user mentioned they already proved the determinant is ±1, which makes sense because determinant is the product of eigenvalues, so if all eigenvalues are ±1, their product would be 1 or -1. But the key step is showing each eigenvalue squares to 1. So the core of the proof is using the equation A² = I and applying it to an eigenvector. So maybe the answer is this: start with the eigenvalue equation, apply A twice, and show that λ² = 1. Therefore, each eigenvalue must be 1 or -1. I think that's the main idea. Let me check if there's another way or if there's a detail I overlooked. For example, is there a possibility of complex eigenvalues? Well, even if λ is complex, λ² = 1 would still require λ to be 1 or -1, because those are the only roots of x² -1 =0 in real or complex numbers. So regardless of the field we're working over (real or complex), the eigenvalues must satisfy λ²=1, hence ±1. So the proof holds. Therefore, the key assumption is that A is involutory (A²=I), and the problem is to show eigenvalues are ±1.",
