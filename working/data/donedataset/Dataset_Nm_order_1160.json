    "Content": "Does anyone know a nice (combinatorial?) proof and/or reference for the following identity? $$\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} \\right)^{n+1} \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^n \\frac{(n-j)!}{n!} |s(n+1, n+1-j)| \\alpha^j \\bmod \\alpha^{n+1}.$$ Here $$\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\frac{B_i \\alpha^i}{i!}$$ is one of the generating functions for the Bernoulli numbers , and $|s(n+1, n+1-j)|$ is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind . Motivation (feel free to ignore): this identity comes from two different computations of the Todd class of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$. One uses the Euler sequence . The other involves computing the holomorphic Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}(k))$ of the line bundles $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ using that the higher cohomology of $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ vanishes for $k$ large enough and that for $k \\ge 0$, $H^0(\\mathcal{O}(k))$ is the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ in $n+1$ variables, which is ${k+n \\choose n}$, then working out what the Todd class must be using Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch . This is a bit indirect to say the least, and I have no idea how to convert it into combinatorics.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The coefficients $B_j^{(r)}$ defined by$$\\sum_{j = 0}^\\infty B_j^{(r)} {{x^j}\\over{j!}} = \\left({x\\over{e^x - 1}}\\right)^r$$are usually called higher order Bernoulli numbers, so your identity is a formula for $B_j^{(r)}$ for $j < r$. Let $c(n, k) = |s(n, k)| = (-1)^{n - k}s(n, k)$. This is a fairly standard notation, used, for example, in Stanley's \"Enumerative Combinatorics\". Then$${{(-\\log(1 - x))^k}\\over{k!}} = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty c(n, k) {{x^n}\\over{n!}}.$$Differentiating this equation gives$${{(-\\log(1 - x))^k}\\over{(1 - x)k!}} = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty c(n + 1, k + 1) {{x^n}\\over{n!}}.\\tag*{$(1)$}$$For any formal Laurent series $f = f(\\alpha)$ we define the residue of $f$, denoted $\\text{res}\\,f$, to be the coefficient of $\\alpha^{-1}$ in $f$. So the coefficient of $\\alpha^k$ in $f$ is $\\text{res}\\,f/\\alpha^{j + 1}$. We will apply Jacobi's change of variables formula for residues, which is a form of the Lagrange inversion formula. See e.g. Gessel's survey of Lagrange inversion at https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05988 , Theorem 4.1.1. Suppose that $f(\\alpha)$ is a formal Laurent series in $\\alpha$ and that $g(\\alpha) = g_1 \\alpha + g_2\\alpha^2 + \\ldots$ is a formal power series in $\\alpha$ with $g_1 \\neq 0$. Then Jacobi's formula says that$$\\text{res}\\,f(\\alpha) = \\text{res}\\,f(g(\\alpha))g'(\\alpha).$$We apply Jacobi's formula with$$f(\\alpha) = \\left({\\alpha\\over{1 - e^{-\\alpha}}}\\right)^{n + 1} \\alpha^{-j - 1}$$and$$g(\\alpha) = -\\log(1 - \\alpha).$$Then the coefficient of $\\alpha^j$ in$$\\left({\\alpha\\over{1 - e^{-\\alpha}}}\\right)^{n + 1}$$is\\begin{align*}\n\\text{res}\\,f(\\alpha) & = \\text{res}\\,f(g(\\alpha))g'(\\alpha) \\\\ & = \\text{res}\\, {{(-\\log(1 - \\alpha)/\\alpha)^{n + 1}}\\over{(-\\log(1 - \\alpha))^{j + 1}(1 - \\alpha)}} \\\\ & = \\text{res}\\,{{(-\\log(1 - \\alpha))^{n - j}}\\over{\\alpha^{n + 1}(1 - \\alpha)}}.\n\\end{align*}This is the coefficient of $\\alpha^n$ in$${{(-\\log( 1- \\alpha))^{n - j}}\\over{1 - \\alpha}}$$which by $(1)$ is$${{(n - j)!}\\over{n!}} c(n + 1, n - j + 1).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition or property applied to one object, and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the original question. The user is asking about a combinatorial identity involving Bernoulli numbers and Stirling numbers. The identity given is:\n\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} \\right)^{n+1} \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^n \\frac{(n-j)!}{n!} |s(n+1, n+1-j)| \\alpha^j \\bmod \\alpha^{n+1}.$$\n\nThey mention that the generating function for Bernoulli numbers is involved, specifically:\n\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\frac{B_i \\alpha^i}{i!},$$\n\nand the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, |s(n+1, n+1-j)|.\n\nThe problem is to prove this identity, possibly with a combinatorial proof or reference. The motivation talks about Todd classes and some algebraic geometry, but the user mentions that part can be ignored.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The example structured the problem by listing each assumption line by line. In the original problem, the key components are:\n\n1. The left-hand side is the (n+1)-th power of the generating function for Bernoulli numbers.\n2. The right-hand side is a sum involving unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.\n3. The congruence is modulo α^{n+1}.\n4. The generating function for Bernoulli numbers is given as a power series.\n5. The coefficients involve Bernoulli numbers B_i.\n6. The Stirling numbers are unsigned and of the first kind.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me break this down:\n\nAssumption 1: The left-hand side is raised to the (n+1)th power. So the expression (α/(1 - e^{-α}))^{n+1} is part of the problem's setup.\n\nAssumption 2: The generating function for Bernoulli numbers is given by the series ∑_{i=0}^∞ (-1)^i (B_i α^i)/i!.\n\nAssumption 3: |s(n+1, n+1-j)| denotes the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.\n\nAssumption 4: The congruence is considered modulo α^{n+1}, meaning we're looking at the identity up to terms of degree higher than or equal to n+1.\n\nAssumption 5: The sum on the right-hand side is from j=0 to n, with coefficients involving (n-j)!/n! times the Stirling numbers.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the sum is from j=0 to n. So perhaps that's part of the problem's structure, not an assumption. The problem is to prove the congruence, given those elements. So maybe the assumptions are about the objects involved:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The generating function for Bernoulli numbers is ∑_{i=0}^∞ (-1)^i (B_i α^i)/i! = α/(1 - e^{-α}).\n\n- |s(n+1, n+1-j)| is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind.\n\n- The congruence is modulo α^{n+1}.\n\nBut the problem is to show that when you take (α/(1 - e^{-α}))^{n+1}, it's congruent to that sum modulo α^{n+1}.\n\nSo the key assumptions are about the definitions of the generating functions and the Stirling numbers. Also, the congruence modulo α^{n+1} is part of the problem's condition.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are about the objects (like the generating function definition, the Stirling numbers), but since the problem is to prove an identity given those definitions, maybe those are the assumptions.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe generating function for Bernoulli numbers is given by ∑_{i=0}^∞ (-1)^i (B_i α^i)/i! = α/(1 - e^{-α}),\n\n|s(n+1, n+1-j)| is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind,\n\nThe congruence holds modulo α^{n+1}.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} \\right)^{n+1} \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^n \\frac{(n-j)!}{n!} |s(n+1, n+1-j)| \\alpha^j \\bmod \\alpha^{n+1}.$$\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe generating function for Bernoulli numbers is $\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\frac{B_i \\alpha^i}{i!}$,\n\n$|s(n+1, n+1-j)|$ is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind,\n\nThe congruence is modulo $\\alpha^{n+1}$,\n\n$j$ ranges from $0$ to $n$ in the summation.\n\nBut perhaps the last one is part of the problem statement. Wait, the problem statement includes the sum from j=0 to n, so maybe that's part of the problem. The problem is to prove the identity with that sum. So the assumptions are about the definitions and the congruence modulus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the modulus being α^{n+1} is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the congruence mod α^{n+1} is part of the problem's equation. So perhaps the modulus is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The generating function for Bernoulli numbers is as given.\n\n- The Stirling numbers are unsigned of the first kind.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the congruence equation. So in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. Wait, the original problem in the example said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split it into two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem was to prove it for every integer n, but the user in the example added an extra assumption (maybe mistakenly). Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, unless there's a mistake. Wait, the original example's formatted problem has assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so perhaps the example has a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have the problem with n divisible by 7. So perhaps in their example, they might have made an error. So perhaps in the current problem, we need to list the definitions as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove that identity holds under the given definitions. So the generating function definition and the Stirling numbers are part of the problem's setup, hence listed as assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The generating function for Bernoulli numbers is given by $\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\frac{B_i \\alpha^i}{i!}$.\n\n2. $|s(n+1, n+1-j)|$ denotes an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind.\n\nThe problem is to prove the congruence modulo α^{n+1}.\n\nTherefore, structuring as:\n\nAssumption:\n\nThe generating function for Bernoulli numbers is $\\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\frac{B_i \\alpha^i}{i!}$,\n\n$|s(n+1, n+1-j)|$ is an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind.\n\nProblem: Prove that\n\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - e^{-\\alpha}} \\right)^{n+1} \\equiv \\sum_{j=0}^n \\frac{(n-j)!}{n!} |s(n+1, n+1-j)| \\alpha^j \\bmod \\alpha^{n+1}.$$\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The modulus modulo α^{n+1} is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. The assumptions are the definitions of the generating function and the Stirling numbers. The rest is part of the problem to prove.",
