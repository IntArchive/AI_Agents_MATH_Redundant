    "Content": "I've just started to work myself into the topic of irreducibility of polynomials and I would like to show the following: Prove that $x^4+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ . I've managed to come up with a proof that seems reasonable to me but I'm not sure if it is actually correct. Could someone tell me if I made any beginner's mistakes? My proof: Clearly $x^4+1$ has no root in $\\mathbb{Q}$ , so it can only be decomposed into two polynomials of degree $2$ . Therefore there must be $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ s.t. $x^4+1=(x^2+ax+1)(x^2+bx+1)$ . If we multiply this out we get $x^4+(a+b)x^3+(ab+2)x^2+(a+b)x+1$ . If we now equate the coefficients we get that $a+b = 0$ and therefore $a = -b$ and that $ab+2=0$ and therefore that $a^2=2$ , which is not possible in $\\mathbb{Q}$ . Any feedback is appreciated!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Your approach in principle works fine you just tried to take a short-cut that is not available, yet is not really needed. Instead: $$(x^4+1) = (x^2+ax+c)(x^2+bx+d)$$ We get $$x^4+(a+b)x^3+(ab+c+d)x^2+(ad+bc)x+cd.$$ You get $cd=1$ and thus $c=d^{-1}$. You still get $a=-b$ (from the third power), and then $ad +bc$ becomes $ad-ac$ and further $a(c^{-1}-c)$. Thus, $a=0$ or $c= c^{-1}$ (that is, $c = \\pm 1$). In the former case, you get $c+ c^{-1}= c+d = 0$ which is impossible. In the latter case, you already dealt with $c=d=1$ and $c= d= -1$ is essentially the same,  it yields the impossible $a^2 = -2$. That said, the Eisenstein approach mentioned in a comment is more elegant, if you have it available.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). They attempted a proof by assuming it factors into two quadratics with rational coefficients and then derived a contradiction. Let me check if their approach is correct and if there are any gaps.\n\nFirst, the user notes that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) has no rational roots. That's true because any rational root would have to be ±1 by the Rational Root Theorem, and plugging those in gives 1 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0. So, no linear factors. Therefore, if it's reducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), it must factor into two quadratics. That’s a valid starting point.\n\nThey set up the factorization as \\( (x^2 + ax + 1)(x^2 + bx + 1) \\). Wait, but why assume both constant terms are 1? The general form would be \\( (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + dx + e) \\) with \\( c, e \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\). By equating coefficients, the constant term would be \\( ce = 1 \\). Since we're working over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), possible values for c and e are 1 and 1 or -1 and -1. The user chose 1 and 1. Maybe they should check both possibilities? Let me see.\n\nIf they consider \\( c = e = 1 \\), then proceed as they did. Multiplying out gives \\( x^4 + (a + d)x^3 + (ad + c + e)x^2 + (ae + cd)x + ce \\). Wait, no, actually, expanding \\( (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + dx + e) \\):\n\nFirst term: x^2 * x^2 = x^4.\n\nNext terms: x^2 * dx + ax * x^2 = dx^3 + ax^3 = (a + d)x^3.\n\nNext terms: x^2 * e + ax * dx + c * x^2 = e x^2 + ad x^2 + c x^2 = (ad + e + c)x^2.\n\nThen, ax * e + c * dx = (ae + cd)x.\n\nFinally, c * e.\n\nSo in the user’s case, they set c = e = 1, so the expansion is x^4 + (a + d)x^3 + (ad + 1 + 1)x^2 + (a*1 + d*1)x + 1*1. That simplifies to x^4 + (a + d)x^3 + (ad + 2)x^2 + (a + d)x + 1. Comparing to \\( x^4 + 1 \\), they set coefficients equal:\n\n1. Coefficient of x^3: a + d = 0.\n\n2. Coefficient of x^2: ad + 2 = 0.\n\n3. Coefficient of x: a + d = 0.\n\n4. Constant term: 1 = 1, which is okay.\n\nFrom 1 and 3, we get a + d = 0, so d = -a. Plugging into 2: a*(-a) + 2 = 0 → -a² + 2 = 0 → a² = 2. So a = ±√2, which is irrational. Therefore, there's no solution in rational numbers a and d, hence no such factorization exists. So the user's proof is correct in this case.\n\nBut wait, what if the constant terms were -1 and -1? Let's check that alternative. Suppose the factorization is \\( (x^2 + ax -1)(x^2 + bx -1) \\). Then expanding:\n\nx^4 + (a + b)x^3 + (ab -1 -1)x^2 + (-a - b)x + 1.\n\nCompare to x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x +1. Then coefficients:\n\n1. a + b = 0 → b = -a.\n\n2. ab -2 = 0 → a*(-a) -2 = -a² -2 = 0 → -a² = 2 → a² = -2, which is impossible even in real numbers. So no solution here either.\n\nThus, regardless of whether the constant terms are 1 or -1, there's no rational solution. Hence, the polynomial doesn't factor into quadratics with rational coefficients. Therefore, the user’s proof is valid, and they didn’t miss any cases.\n\nAnother method to prove irreducibility is using Eisenstein's criterion, but the standard form doesn't apply here. However, sometimes applying Eisenstein after a substitution. For example, substitute x = y + 1 or another shift. Let's check:\n\nLet x = y + 1. Then x^4 +1 becomes (y +1)^4 +1 = y^4 + 4y^3 +6y^2 +4y +2. Applying Eisenstein with p=2: 4,6,4,2. Coefficients are 1,4,6,4,2. 2 divides all coefficients except the leading one, and 2²=4 does not divide the constant term 2. So Eisenstein applies here with p=2, hence irreducible. Wait, but the original polynomial is x^4 +1, which under substitution x = y +1 gives a polynomial that is Eisenstein at 2. Therefore, this substitution shows irreducibility. But the user didn't mention this approach, but their method is also correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to factor over the reals and see if it can factor into rationals. The polynomial factors over reals as (x^2 + √2 x +1)(x^2 -√2 x +1), but since √2 is irrational, these factors aren't in \\( \\mathbb{Q}[x] \\). So again, no rational factors.\n\nSo, the user’s proof is correct. They considered the only possible factorization into quadratics, showed that it leads to a contradiction in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), hence the polynomial is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\). They might have been concerned that they didn't check all possible factorizations, like different constant terms or different coefficients, but in this case, the only possible constant terms (given that their product must be 1) are 1 and 1 or -1 and -1, both of which lead to contradictions. Therefore, the proof is valid.",
