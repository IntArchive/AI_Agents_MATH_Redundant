    "Content": "Here it is asked whether for every $k>1$, there is a prime $p$ and $w_1,w_2,\\cdots ,w_k>1$, such that $p$ divides $w_1^2+w_2^2+\\cdots +w_k^2$, but none of the summands. Can we prove there is a solution for every $k$, if the $w$s must be pairwise distinct ? The prime $p$ need not be the same for different $k$s.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Let $p$ be any prime dividing $k$ (it exists since $k > 1$). Then set $w_1 = p + 1, \\: w_2 = 2p + 1, \\: \\dots, \\: w_k = kp + 1$ (in general, $w_i = ip + 1$). Now, clearly $p \\nmid w_i$ and the $w_i$'s are pairwise distinct. Moreover, $$w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \\cdots + w_k^2 \\equiv \\underset{k \\: \\text{times}}{\\underbrace{1 + \\cdots + 1}} = k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$$ Thus $p \\mid w_1^2 + \\cdots + w_k^2$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out the unrelated info, and present it with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user:\n\nThe title is \"Can we prove a stronger claim?\" The question is asking whether for every k > 1, there exists a prime p and integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k >1 such that p divides the sum of their squares but doesn't divide any of the individual summands. Additionally, the user wants to know if we can prove there's a solution for every k when the w's must be pairwise distinct. The prime p can vary for different k's.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse through the problem.\n\nThe main problem is to prove that for every k >1, there exists a prime p and k numbers w_1 to w_k (each >1), pairwise distinct, such that p divides the sum of their squares but doesn't divide any of the individual w_i^2.\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- k is an integer greater than 1.\n- The w_i's are integers greater than 1.\n- The w_i's are pairwise distinct.\n- There exists a prime p such that p divides the sum w_1^2 + ... + w_k^2.\n- The prime p does not divide any of the w_i^2 (and hence doesn't divide any w_i).\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition for one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is an integer,\n- k > 1,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i is an integer,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i > 1,\n- For all i ≠ j, w_i ≠ w_j (pairwise distinct),\n- There exists a prime p,\n- p divides the sum w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_k^2,\n- For each i from 1 to k, p does not divide w_i^2.\n\nThe problem statement would then be: Prove that for every integer k >1, such a prime p and integers w_1, ..., w_k exist with the given conditions.\n\nWait, the original question is phrased as asking whether this can be proven. So the problem is to prove existence for every k>1.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the actual statement to prove. So in the example, the original problem had some extra context, but the formatted problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the user is asking whether we can prove there's a solution for every k with distinct w's. The problem statement should then be the assertion that needs to be proven.\n\nSo, the problem would be: Prove that for every integer k >1, there exists a prime p and k pairwise distinct integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k >1 such that p divides the sum w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_k^2 but p does not divide any of the w_i^2.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that the prime p can vary for different k's. However, since the problem is for each k, p can be different, so maybe that's already implied. The example didn't include \"for different n\" because the problem was for every n. Here, since it's for every k, p can be different per k, which is allowed. So perhaps that doesn't need to be an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be each of the conditions on k, the w_i's, and the existence of p with those divisibility conditions. Each as separate lines.\n\nNow, checking if I have all the necessary parts. Let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nOriginal problem mentions \"the prime p need not be the same for different k's\". So maybe that's a condition, but in the problem statement, since we're asked to prove existence for each k, the prime p can vary. So perhaps that's part of the problem statement rather than an assumption. The example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user restructured it with assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but problem is to prove divisibility by 91. Wait, that might be an error. Wait the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But if the original problem says for every integer n, why is the assumption n divisible by 7? That seems contradictory. Wait maybe the example was from another problem?\n\nWait, maybe the example given by the user is not correctly formatted? Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would restrict it. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user is using it as a template.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the user's example is not the best, but we have to follow the instructions. For the current problem, the key is to list all assumptions. The problem is asking whether for every k>1, there exists p and w_i's with certain properties. So the assumptions would be the conditions on k and the w_i's and p. So the problem is to prove that such p and w_i's exist for every k>1.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is an integer,\n- k > 1,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i is an integer,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i > 1,\n- For all i ≠ j, w_i and w_j are distinct,\n- There exists a prime p,\n- p divides the sum w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_k^2,\n- For each i from 1 to k, p does not divide w_i^2.\n\nProblem: Prove that for every integer k >1, there exist a prime p and integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k satisfying the above conditions.\n\nBut the user might want each assumption line to be a single condition. So each line should state one condition. For example:\n\nAssumption:\n- k is an integer,\n- k > 1,\n- w_1, w_2, ..., w_k are integers,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i > 1,\n- For all i ≠ j, w_i ≠ w_j,\n- There exists a prime p,\n- p divides w_1^2 + w_2^2 + ... + w_k^2,\n- For each i from 1 to k, p does not divide w_i^2.\n\nProblem: Prove that such p and w_1, w_2, ..., w_k exist for every integer k >1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be phrased as: Prove that for every integer k >1, there exists a prime p and k pairwise distinct integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k >1 such that p divides the sum of their squares but does not divide any individual square.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is the concise statement to prove, with the assumptions listed separately.\n\nSo, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems like the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricts to n divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example, but perhaps the user intended that the original problem had some hidden assumption or perhaps the example was from a different problem.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original question is asking whether for every k>1, there exists a prime p and distinct w_i's >1 such that p divides the sum but not any summand. The user wants to structure this into Assumption and Problem.\n\nSo in the assumptions, we need to list all the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to prove existence for every k>1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- k is an integer.\n- k > 1.\n- w_1, w_2, ..., w_k are integers.\n- Each w_i > 1.\n- w_i are pairwise distinct.\n- There exists a prime p.\n- p divides the sum of squares of w_i.\n- For each w_i, p does not divide w_i^2.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for every integer k >1, such p and w_i exist.\n\nI think this covers all the conditions. Each line is one assumption. Now, the problem statement is to prove that for every k>1, these exist.\n\nBut maybe the existence of p is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, the problem is to show that there exists p and w_i's with those properties. So the existence is the conclusion, not the assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the original problem, the user is asking: \"Can we prove a stronger claim?\" Specifically, the question is whether for every k>1, there exists p and w_i's (distinct, >1) such that p divides the sum but none of the summands. So the problem is to prove existence. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions that must be satisfied by k, p, and w_i's. The problem is to prove that such p and w_i's exist for each k>1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should list all the conditions that the solution must satisfy. So each line is a condition that the objects (k, p, w_i's) must satisfy. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- k is an integer,\n- k > 1,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i is an integer,\n- For each i from 1 to k, w_i > 1,\n- For all i ≠ j, w_i ≠ w_j,\n- p is a prime,\n- p divides (w_1² + w_2² + ... + w_k²),\n- For each i from 1 to k, p does not divide w_i².\n\nProblem: Prove that for every integer k >1, there exist a prime p and integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k satisfying the above conditions.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single condition. The problem is to prove existence for every k>1.\n\nI think this is the correct structure. Let me check again. The original question's additional condition is that the w's must be pairwise distinct, which is covered in \"For all i ≠ j, w_i ≠ w_j\". The prime p need not be the same for different k's, but since the problem is for each k, p can vary, so that's already allowed. Thus, no need to state that p can vary in assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: \nk is an integer,\nk > 1,\nFor each i from 1 to k, w_i is an integer,\nFor each i from 1 to k, w_i > 1,\nFor all i ≠ j, w_i ≠ w_j,\np is a prime,\np divides w_1² + w_2² + ... + w_k²,\nFor each i from 1 to k, p does not divide w_i².\nProblem: \nProve that for every integer k >1, there exist a prime p and integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_k satisfying the above conditions.\n\nYes, this seems right.",
