    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user wants to prove that the integral from a to b of 1 over the square root of (x-a)(b-x) dx equals pi. Hmm, first, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions on a and b, but since the integral involves square roots of (x-a) and (b-x), the expression inside the square root must be positive. That means (x-a) and (b-x) should both be positive, so x has to be between a and b. Therefore, the integral is from a to b, which makes sense because the interval [a, b] ensures the integrand is real. \n\nWait, does the user assume anything else? The problem statement just gives the integral and asks to prove it's equal to pi. So the key assumptions here would be that a and b are real numbers with a < b, ensuring the interval is valid and the integrand is real and positive in the open interval (a, b). Each assumption should be listed line by line. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a and b are real numbers.\n- a is less than b.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the integral equals pi. \n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. For example, the integral is a definite integral over [a, b], so the function must be integrable there. Since the integrand is 1 over sqrt((x-a)(b-x)), which is continuous on (a, b) and has integrable singularities at the endpoints a and b, the integral converges. So maybe that's another assumption, but the example given in the original prompt didn't include convergence as an explicit assumption. The original example only listed conditions on variables, not on the integrability. So perhaps the user expects only the basic assumptions on a and b. \n\nTherefore, sticking to the example's style, the main assumptions are that a and b are real numbers with a < b. The problem is to prove the integral equals pi. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\na and b are real numbers,\na is less than b.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_a^b\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{(x-a)(b-x)}}=\\pi.$$\n\nI think that's all. The user might have been confused because integrating such a function from a to b resulting in pi is non-intuitive unless you recognize it's related to the Beta function or trigonometric substitution. But in terms of structuring the problem, those are the key assumptions and the problem statement.",
