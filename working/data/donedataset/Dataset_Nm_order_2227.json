    "Content": "It is well-known that for any ultrafilter $\\mathscr{u}$ in $\\mathbb{N}$, the map\\begin{equation}a\\mapsto \\lim_{\\mathscr{u}}a\\end{equation} is a multiplicative linear functional, where $\\lim_{\\mathscr{u}}a$ is the limit of the sequence $a$ along $\\mathscr{u}$. I vaguely remember someone once told me that every multiplicative linear functional on $\\ell^{\\infty}$ is of this form. That is, given a multiplicative linear functional $h$ on $\\ell^{\\infty}$, there is an ultrafilter $\\mathscr{u}$ such that \\begin{equation}\nh(a)=\\lim_{\\mathscr{u}}a\n\\end{equation} for all $a\\in\\ell^{\\infty}$. However, I cannot find a proof to this. I can show that if $h$ is the evaluation at $n$, then $h$ corresponds to the principal ultrafilter centered at $n$, but there are other kinds of multiplicative functionals (all these must vanish on any linear combinations of point masses though). Can somebody give a hint on how to do this latter case?\nThanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There are several ways of doing this, but I'll go with the most \"elementary\". Let $\\varphi$ be a nonzero multiplicative functional on $\\ell^\\infty(\\mathbb{N})$. Since $\\varphi(1)=\\varphi(1^2)=\\varphi(1)^2$, we get that $\\varphi(1)=1$ (it cannot be zero, because then $\\varphi=0$). Now let $a\\in\\ell^\\infty(\\mathbb{N})$ such that $a(n)\\in\\{0,1\\}$ for all $n$. Write $\\alpha=\\varphi(a)$. As $a(1-a)=0$, we have \n$$\n0=\\varphi(a(1-a))=\\varphi(a)\\varphi(1-a)=\\alpha(1-\\alpha).\n$$\nSo either $\\alpha=0$ or $\\alpha=1$. Note that we can write $a=1_A$, $A\\subset\\mathbb{N}$, where $A=\\{n: a(n)=1\\}$. Now define\n$$\n\\mathcal U=\\{A:\\ \\varphi(1_A)=1\\}.\n$$\nWe can see that $\\mathbb{N}\\in\\mathcal U$ (since $\\varphi(1)=1$) $A\\in\\mathcal U\\ \\iff\\ A^c\\not\\in\\mathcal U$ (because $1_A\\,1_{A^c}=0$) If $A,B\\in\\mathcal U$, then $A\\cap B\\in\\mathcal U$ (because $1_{A\\cap B}=1_A\\,1_B$) If $A\\in\\mathcal U$ and $A\\subset B$, then $B\\in\\mathcal U$ (because $1_A=1_A\\,1_B$) In other words, $\\mathcal U$ is an ultrafilter. Now let $c\\in\\ell^\\infty(\\mathbb{N})$ be positive, i.e. $0\\leq c\\leq 1$. Define sets\n$$\nA_j^{(n)}=\\{m:\\ \\frac{j}{2^n}\\leq c(m)<\\frac{(j+1)}{2^n}\\},\\ \\ j=0,1,\\ldots,2^n.\n$$\nFor fixed $n$, these sets are pairwise disjoint and $$\\tag{1}\\bigcup_jA_j^{(n)}=\\mathbb{N}.$$\nAs $\\mathcal U$ is an ultrafilter, for each $n$ there is exactly one $j(n)$ such that $A_{j(n)}^{(n)}\\in\\mathcal U$, and none of the others is (if $A\\cup B=\\mathbb N$, then either $A\\in\\mathcal U$ or $B=A^c\\in\\mathcal U$; by induction, this applies to arbitrary partitions of $\\mathbb N$). Define\n$$\nc_n=\\sum_{j=0}^{2^n-1}\\,\\frac{j}{2^n}\\,1_{A_j^{(n)}}.\n$$\nBy definition, $\\|c-c_n\\|\\leq 2^{-n}$, so $c_n\\to c$ in norm. As $\\varphi$ is norm-continuous, we have  $\\varphi(c)=\\lim_n\\varphi(c_n)$. And\n$$\n\\varphi(c_n)=\\sum_{j=0}^{2^n-1}\\,\\frac{j}{2^n}\\,\\varphi(1_{A_j^{(n)}})=\\frac{j(n)}{2^n},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\varphi(c)=\\lim_n \\ c(j(n))=\\lim_{\\mathcal U}\\ c.\n$$\nLast step is to extend by linearity to all of $\\ell^\\infty(\\mathbb{N})$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. \n\nThe problem is about multiplicative linear functionals on ℓ^∞. The user mentions that every multiplicative linear functional corresponds to the limit along an ultrafilter. The key points here are:\n\n1. The context is ℓ^∞, the space of bounded sequences.\n2. The functional in question is multiplicative and linear.\n3. The goal is to show that such a functional must be the limit along some ultrafilter.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is told that for any ultrafilter, the limit along it is a multiplicative linear functional. The converse is what's to be proven: every multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞ arises this way.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- h is a multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞. (This is the main object and its properties.)\n- The space considered is ℓ^∞ (the space of bounded sequences). (Assumption about the space where the functional is defined.)\n- The ultrafilter u is in ℕ. (Because the problem is about sequences indexed by natural numbers.)\n  \nWait, but the problem statement is about showing that given h, there exists an ultrafilter u such that h(a) = lim_u a for all a. So the assumptions are about h being a multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞, and the problem is to prove it's equal to some ultrafilter limit.\n\nBut the example given in the original question had assumptions listed as properties of the objects involved. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- h is a multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞.\n- The space ℓ^∞ consists of bounded sequences.\n- The ultrafilter u is in βℕ (the Stone-Čech compactification, but maybe just stating it's an ultrafilter on ℕ).\n\nWait, but the problem is to show that any multiplicative linear functional h is of the form lim_u a for some ultrafilter u. So the main assumption is that h is a multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞. The problem is to prove that h corresponds to an ultrafilter limit.\n\nSo in the Assumption section, each line should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nh is a multiplicative linear functional,\nh is defined on ℓ^∞,\nℓ^∞ is the space of bounded real (or complex) sequences,\nu is an ultrafilter on ℕ.\n\nWait, but the problem is not assuming u exists; the problem is to prove that such a u exists given h. So the assumptions are only about h and ℓ^∞. The existence of u is part of what needs to be proven.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be:\n\nh is a multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞,\nℓ^∞ is the space of bounded sequences.\n\nBut maybe the original problem mentions that it's well-known that for any ultrafilter u, the limit is a multiplicative linear functional, but the converse is what's being asked. So the user is starting from h being a multiplicative linear functional and needs to find u. Therefore, the assumptions are about h's properties and the space.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nh is a multiplicative linear functional,\nh is defined on ℓ^∞,\nℓ^∞ is the space of bounded sequences.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists an ultrafilter u on ℕ such that h(a) = lim_u a for all a ∈ ℓ^∞.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement says \"every multiplicative linear functional on ℓ^∞ is of this form\". So maybe the problem is to show that for every multiplicative linear functional h on ℓ^∞, there exists an ultrafilter u on ℕ such that h(a) = lim_u a for all a in ℓ^∞.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- h is a multiplicative linear functional,\n- h is defined on ℓ^∞,\n- ℓ^∞ consists of bounded sequences.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists an ultrafilter u on ℕ such that h(a) = lim_u a for all a ∈ ℓ^∞.\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The problem is to show the existence of the ultrafilter that represents h as the limit along it.",
