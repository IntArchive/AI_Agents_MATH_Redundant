    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let's start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking how to prove that the nth power of the matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]] equals the matrix [[F_{n+1}, F_n], [F_n, F_{n-1}]], where F_n represents the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem statement here is about proving a matrix exponentiation result related to Fibonacci numbers. The key assumptions here would be the properties or conditions that each object in the problem must satisfy. Let me break it down.\n\nThe matrix in question is [[1, 1], [1, 0]]. The exponent is n, which I assume is a positive integer, maybe including zero, but the problem doesn't specify. However, in mathematical induction proofs for such matrix exponentials, n is typically a non-negative integer. Also, the Fibonacci sequence is defined here with F_{n+1}, F_n, etc., so we might need to consider the definition of Fibonacci numbers. But the problem itself doesn't state the initial conditions of the Fibonacci sequence, so maybe that's an implicit assumption? Wait, the problem is to prove the equality, so the Fibonacci numbers here are defined as per the standard recurrence: F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2. But does that count as an assumption here?\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the problem is about proving the matrix identity. The assumptions would likely include that n is a non-negative integer, since matrix powers are defined for integer exponents, and the Fibonacci sequence is defined for non-negative integers as well. Also, the matrix multiplication follows standard rules. \n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n\n1. n is a non-negative integer.\n2. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, and F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n ≥ 2.\n3. The matrix exponentiation is defined as repeated multiplication.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention the definition of Fibonacci numbers. However, since the problem is about proving the matrix equality in terms of Fibonacci numbers, the definition of Fibonacci numbers is a necessary assumption. Otherwise, the reader might not know what F_n refers to. So that's an important assumption. But in the original problem, the user just mentions \"Fibonacci sequence with matrices,\" so maybe the Fibonacci sequence is given, but the exact starting values might vary. However, the standard starting points are F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1. So perhaps the problem assumes that the Fibonacci sequence is defined in the standard way.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that the Fibonacci numbers are defined in the standard recurrence relation. Also, the exponent n must be a non-negative integer because otherwise, taking the matrix power might not make sense (unless we consider inverses, but the problem doesn't mention negative exponents). \n\nSo, listing the assumptions:\n\n- n is a non-negative integer.\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1, and Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 2.\n- The matrix exponentiation is performed using standard matrix multiplication.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumptions were more about the conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is to prove the matrix identity. So, the key assumptions are the definition of the Fibonacci sequence and the value of n. The matrix exponentiation is standard, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem's context. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only explicit assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, and the rest is part of the problem's statement. But in the problem, the user writes \"How do you prove that: [matrix equation]\". The problem statement doesn't define F_n, so perhaps the assumption is that F_n follows the standard Fibonacci definition. Therefore, to make the problem self-contained, the assumptions should include the definition of the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₀ = 0, F₁ = 1,\nFor n ≥ 2, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}^n\n= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_{n+1} & F_n\\\\\nF_{n} & F_{n-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was part of the original problem. Wait, in the original example, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example was modified. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict n. That seems like an error in the example.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, there was a misunderstanding. Maybe the original problem had a different condition, but the user example is incorrect. However, regardless, the user is asking me to follow their format. In their example, they split the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions. So, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is \"n is an integer\", and then they added \"n is divisible by 7\" which might not be in the original. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut perhaps the point is to extract the assumptions from the problem. If the problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption is \"n is an integer\". If there's an additional condition, like \"n is divisible by 7\", that's another assumption. So, in the current problem, the user is asking to prove the matrix equation, so the assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a non-negative integer (since matrix powers are typically defined for non-negative integers unless specified otherwise).\n2. The Fibonacci numbers are defined with F₀=0, F₁=1, and the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, these are the necessary assumptions. The problem itself is to prove the matrix equality.",
