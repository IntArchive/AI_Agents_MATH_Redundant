    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a finite group G and a permutation γ in the symmetric group on G (which means γ is a bijection from G to itself). The conditions given are that γ fixes the identity element (γ(1) = 1) and that γ respects left cosets of any subgroup H of G. Specifically, for any g in G and any subgroup H ≤ G, γ(gH) = γ(g)H. The goal is to show that γ fixes the left cosets of the center C(G) of G. That is, for any g in G, γ(gC(G)) = gC(G), or equivalently, γ(g)C(G) = gC(G).\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the conditions. γ is a permutation of the elements of G that maps left cosets of any subgroup H to left cosets of H. Moreover, this permutation maps the identity element to itself. The problem is to show that when H is the center C(G), then the entire coset gC(G) is fixed by γ. That is, γ doesn't just permute the cosets of C(G), but actually fixes each coset as a set.\n\nHmm. So, since γ is a permutation of G that preserves the group operation? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because γ is just a permutation, not necessarily a group homomorphism. But it does preserve the left cosets of every subgroup. That is, if you take a coset gH, apply γ to every element, you get another coset of H, namely γ(g)H. So, for any H ≤ G, γ permutes the left cosets of H. But in the case where H is the center C(G), we need to show that this permutation is actually the identity permutation on the cosets of C(G). So, γ(g)C(G) = gC(G) for all g in G.\n\nLet me think. Since γ is a permutation of G that preserves all left cosets of any subgroup, perhaps there is some property of the center that can be used here. The center C(G) consists of elements that commute with every element of G. So, the cosets gC(G) are the conjugacy classes? Wait, no, conjugacy classes are different. The center is the set of elements that commute with everyone, so each coset gC(G) is a subset of G, but not necessarily conjugacy classes.\n\nBut perhaps we can use the fact that the center is a normal subgroup. Since C(G) is normal, the left cosets are the same as the right cosets. Also, the quotient group G/C(G) is a group. Maybe the permutation γ induces an automorphism on G/C(G)?\n\nWait, γ is a permutation of G that preserves all left cosets. So for any subgroup H, including C(G), γ permutes the cosets. But we need to show that for H = C(G), this permutation is trivial. That is, γ(gC(G)) = gC(G). So, how does γ act on the cosets? Since γ(gH) = γ(g)H, then the permutation of the cosets is determined by where γ sends the representatives. So, if H is C(G), then γ(gC(G)) = γ(g)C(G). But we need to show that γ(g)C(G) = gC(G). So, this would mean that γ(g) is in gC(G), i.e., γ(g) = g c for some c in C(G). So, γ acts on each element g by multiplying it by an element of the center, possibly depending on g. But since γ is a permutation of G, this multiplication must be consistent in some way.\n\nBut how do we connect this with the other condition that γ(1) = 1? Because if we take g = 1, then γ(1*C(G)) = γ(1)C(G) = 1*C(G), which is C(G). So, at least the coset of the identity is fixed. But we need to show that all cosets are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the induced permutation on G/C(G). Since γ permutes the cosets, we have a permutation π of G/C(G) defined by π(gC(G)) = γ(g)C(G). But we need to show that π is the identity permutation. Since γ(1) = 1, then π(C(G)) = C(G). Maybe there is a way to show that π is an automorphism of G/C(G), but since G/C(G) is a group, and automorphisms have certain properties. But G/C(G) is centerless, right? The center of G/C(G) is trivial. So, if we have a permutation of G/C(G) induced by γ, which is compatible with the group operation?\n\nWait, but γ is not necessarily a group homomorphism. However, the condition that γ(gH) = γ(g)H for all H ≤ G might imply that γ is a group automorphism. Wait, if we take H = G, then γ(gG) = γ(g)G, which is just G. So that doesn't tell us anything. If we take H = {1}, then γ(g{1}) = γ(g){1}, so γ is a permutation of G. But if we take H = some other subgroup, maybe we can derive that γ is a homomorphism.\n\nWait, let's check if γ is a group automorphism. Suppose γ(ab) = γ(a)γ(b). Let's see if the given conditions imply this. Let me test with H = G. Then, for any g in G, γ(gG) = γ(g)G. But gG = G, so γ(G) = γ(g)G. Since γ is a permutation, γ(G) = G, so γ(g)G = G, which is always true. So that doesn't give us anything. If we take H = {1}, then γ(g{1}) = γ(g){1}, which is just saying that γ is a permutation. Not helpful.\n\nBut maybe take H as the cyclic subgroup generated by some element. Let's see. Suppose H is generated by h. Then, γ(g⟨h⟩) = γ(g)⟨h⟩. So, if γ sends the coset g⟨h⟩ to γ(g)⟨h⟩. So, in general, γ permutes the cosets of any cyclic subgroup. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that since γ permutes the left cosets of every subgroup, it must preserve some structure. For example, conjugation. If γ permutes the cosets of H, then maybe γ commutes with conjugation? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look at the action of γ on G. Since γ is a permutation of G, and it preserves all left cosets, then for any H ≤ G, γ acts as a permutation on the set of left cosets G/H. So, for each H, we have a permutation π_H of G/H such that π_H(gH) = γ(g)H. Now, the problem states that for H = C(G), we need to show that π_{C(G)} is the identity permutation. So, π_{C(G)}(gC(G)) = γ(g)C(G) = gC(G). Thus, we need to show that γ(g)C(G) = gC(G), which is equivalent to γ(g) ∈ gC(G) for all g ∈ G.\n\nTherefore, we need to prove that γ(g) is in the coset gC(G). So, for each g, there exists c ∈ C(G) such that γ(g) = g c.\n\nHow can we show that? Let's consider the properties of γ.\n\nWe know γ(1) = 1, which is already in 1*C(G) since 1 is in C(G). So, that case is fine.\n\nSuppose we take H = C(G). Then, the permutation π_{C(G)} acts on G/C(G). Since γ(g C(G)) = γ(g) C(G), and we need to show this is equal to g C(G). Therefore, π_{C(G)} is the identity permutation.\n\nBut why is π_{C(G)} the identity? Perhaps because G/C(G) has trivial center, and the permutation π_{C(G)} commutes with the left multiplication in G/C(G)?\n\nWait, let's think about the group G/C(G). Let’s denote this quotient group as Q = G/C(G). Then Q is a group with trivial center. The permutation π_{C(G)} is a permutation of Q, since the cosets are elements of Q. Now, the permutation π_{C(G)} is such that π(q) = γ(g) C(G) where q = g C(G). So, π is a permutation of Q. But how does π relate to the group structure of Q?\n\nPerhaps the permutation π must be an automorphism of Q. Let me check. Suppose we have two elements q1 = g1 C(G) and q2 = g2 C(G) in Q. Then, the product q1 q2 is (g1 g2) C(G). If π is an automorphism, then π(q1 q2) = π(q1) π(q2). Let’s see what π(q1 q2) would be. It would be γ(g1 g2) C(G). On the other hand, π(q1) π(q2) = γ(g1) C(G) γ(g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). So, for π to be a homomorphism, we need γ(g1 g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). That is, γ(g1 g2) ≡ γ(g1) γ(g2) mod C(G). So, γ(g1 g2) = γ(g1) γ(g2) c for some c ∈ C(G). But is this true?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that γ preserves all left cosets of all subgroups. So, if we take H = C(G), then for any g, γ(g C(G)) = γ(g) C(G). But if we can show that γ is a homomorphism modulo C(G), then we can get that π is an automorphism of Q. However, I'm not sure how to connect this.\n\nAlternatively, since γ preserves all left cosets, maybe it commutes with inner automorphisms. Let's think. Let’s take an element x ∈ G, and consider the inner automorphism φ_x: g ↦ x g x^{-1}. Does γ commute with φ_x? That is, does γ(φ_x(g)) = φ_x(γ(g))? If so, then γ would be an automorphism commuting with all inner automorphisms, which would imply that γ is in the center of Aut(G), but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps take any element x ∈ G. Then, consider the left coset x H for H = C(G). Since γ(x H) = γ(x) H. If we can relate this to conjugation, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, take H = ⟨x⟩, a cyclic subgroup generated by x. Then, γ(g⟨x⟩) = γ(g)⟨x⟩. But not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that γ preserves all left cosets, so in particular, it preserves the conjugacy classes? Wait, conjugacy classes are not necessarily cosets. Wait, conjugacy classes are orbits under the conjugation action. Maybe not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following: since γ permutes the left cosets of any subgroup H, and in particular, H = C(G), then π_{C(G)} is a permutation of Q = G/C(G). Since Q has trivial center, perhaps π_{C(G)} must be the identity permutation because any automorphism of Q that commutes with all inner automorphisms is trivial? But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, since Q has trivial center, the only automorphisms that commute with all inner automorphisms are inner automorphisms themselves. But π_{C(G)} is a permutation induced by γ. If π_{C(G)} is an automorphism, then since Q is centerless, it must be an inner automorphism. However, if we can show that π_{C(G)} commutes with all inner automorphisms of Q, then it must be trivial. Wait, but how do we know that π_{C(G)} commutes with all inner automorphisms?\n\nAlternatively, take any element q ∈ Q, and consider the inner automorphism φ_q: Q → Q defined by φ_q(q') = q q' q^{-1}. If π_{C(G)} commutes with φ_q for all q ∈ Q, then π_{C(G)} is in the center of Aut(Q). But since Q has trivial center, its automorphism group has trivial center as well. Therefore, π_{C(G)} must be the identity.\n\nBut how do we show that π_{C(G)} commutes with all inner automorphisms of Q?\n\nAlternatively, think about how π_{C(G)} is defined. For any q = gC(G), π_{C(G)}(q) = γ(g)C(G). So, if we can show that π_{C(G)} is an automorphism of Q and that it commutes with all inner automorphisms, then it must be the identity.\n\nTo show π_{C(G)} is an automorphism, we need to show that π_{C(G)}(q1 q2) = π_{C(G)}(q1) π_{C(G)}(q2). That is, γ(g1 g2)C(G) = γ(g1)C(G) γ(g2)C(G) = γ(g1)γ(g2)C(G). So, we need γ(g1 g2) ≡ γ(g1) γ(g2) mod C(G). So, γ(g1 g2) = γ(g1) γ(g2) c for some c ∈ C(G). If this holds, then π_{C(G)} is a homomorphism.\n\nBut how do we show that γ(g1 g2) ≡ γ(g1) γ(g2) mod C(G)?\n\nAlternatively, take H = G, then γ(gG) = γ(g)G, which is trivial. Take H = C(G), but that's the case we are interested in. Maybe use the fact that γ preserves all left cosets, so for any H, and in particular, for H = C(G), but I need a different approach.\n\nWait, another idea: since γ preserves left cosets of every subgroup, then for any g ∈ G and any h ∈ H ≤ G, γ(g h) ∈ γ(g) H. Therefore, γ(g h) = γ(g) h' for some h' ∈ H. So, γ(g h) = γ(g) h' where h' depends on g and h. But if we fix H = C(G), then for any h ∈ C(G), γ(g h) = γ(g) h', where h' ∈ C(G). So, for h ∈ C(G), we have γ(g h) = γ(g) h'.\n\nBut since h is in the center, it commutes with everything. Let's see. Maybe consider commuting elements.\n\nAlternatively, since h is in the center, g h = h g. So, γ(g h) = γ(h g). But γ(h g) must be in γ(h) C(G) and also in γ(g) C(G). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's take H = C(G). For any h ∈ C(G), we have γ(g h) = γ(g) h' where h' ∈ C(G). So, if we fix g and vary h ∈ C(G), then γ(g h) = γ(g) h'. Let's consider the map φ_g: C(G) → C(G) defined by φ_g(h) = h' where γ(g h) = γ(g) h'. Since γ is a bijection, φ_g must be a permutation of C(G). Moreover, since γ(1) = 1, when g = 1, we have γ(1 * h) = γ(1) * h' ⇒ γ(h) = h', so φ_1(h) = γ(h). But since H = C(G) is abelian, maybe these maps φ_g are automorphisms?\n\nAlternatively, since γ is a permutation of G that preserves left cosets of C(G), then for each g, the map φ_g: C(G) → C(G) defined by γ(g h) = γ(g) φ_g(h) is a permutation of C(G). Because if you fix g, then as h ranges over C(G), g h ranges over the coset g C(G), and γ(g h) ranges over γ(g) C(G). Therefore, φ_g must be a bijection from C(G) to itself.\n\nNow, if we can show that φ_g is the identity map, then γ(g h) = γ(g) h, which would imply that γ is C(G)-equivariant. Then, in particular, for h ∈ C(G), γ(g h) = γ(g) h. Then, if we set g = 1, we get γ(h) = γ(1) h = 1 * h = h, since γ(1) = 1. Therefore, φ_1 is the identity map, so γ fixes C(G) pointwise. Then, for any g ∈ G and h ∈ C(G), γ(g h) = γ(g) h. Then, since γ is a bijection and fixes C(G) pointwise, maybe we can use this to show that γ(g) ∈ g C(G).\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose we take h ∈ C(G). Then, γ(g) h = γ(g h). But since h is in C(G), and γ fixes C(G), γ(h) = h. So, γ(g h) = γ(g) h. Now, suppose we write γ(g) = g c_g for some c_g ∈ C(G). Then, γ(g h) = g c_g h. But also, γ(g h) = γ(g) h = g c_g h. So, this holds. Therefore, if γ(g) = g c_g for some c_g ∈ C(G), then the condition γ(g h) = γ(g) h is satisfied. Conversely, suppose that γ(g h) = γ(g) h for all h ∈ C(G). Let’s set h = 1, which is in C(G), then γ(g *1) = γ(g) *1, which is trivial. But for other h, this gives us a condition on γ. If we fix g and vary h, then since γ is a bijection, the map h ↦ γ(g h) must be a bijection from C(G) to γ(g) C(G). But if γ(g h) = γ(g) h, then this map is h ↦ γ(g) h, which is a bijection (right multiplication by γ(g) is a permutation of G, but restricted to C(G), since γ(g) is in some coset, but maybe not. Wait, but γ(g) is in γ(g C(G)) = γ(g) C(G). So, if γ(g) is in γ(g) C(G), then multiplying by h ∈ C(G) on the right gives elements in γ(g) C(G). So, the map h ↦ γ(g) h is a bijection from C(G) to γ(g) C(G). Therefore, the condition γ(g h) = γ(g) h for all h ∈ C(G) is equivalent to γ being C(G)-equivariant. But we need to show that γ(g) ∈ g C(G). \n\nSuppose we assume that γ(g) = g c_g for some c_g ∈ C(G). Then, γ(g C(G)) = γ(g) C(G) = g c_g C(G) = g C(G), since c_g is in C(G). Therefore, the coset is fixed. So, our goal is to show that γ(g) ∈ g C(G) for all g ∈ G.\n\nHow can we show this? Let's consider the permutation π induced on G/C(G). We need to show that π is the identity permutation. To do this, we can use the fact that G/C(G) has trivial center and that any automorphism of G/C(G) induced by conjugation must be inner. But since γ is not necessarily a group automorphism, but a permutation that preserves all cosets, maybe π is an automorphism.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since γ preserves all left cosets, including the conjugacy classes? Wait, no, cosets and conjugacy classes are different. Alternatively, since for any H ≤ G, γ permutes the left cosets of H, then in particular, for H = the centralizer of an element, but that might complicate things.\n\nAnother approach: Let’s consider that γ induces an automorphism on the lattice of subgroups of G. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the action of γ on G. Since γ preserves all left cosets of all subgroups, then for any subgroup H, and any g ∈ G, γ(gH) = γ(g)H. This is similar to the property of a group automorphism, except that γ is not required to be a homomorphism. However, a group automorphism does satisfy γ(gH) = γ(g)γ(H), but here we have γ(gH) = γ(g)H, which is different unless γ(H) = H for all H. But γ is a permutation, so it could send H to a different subgroup. Wait, no. If H is a subgroup, then γ(gH) = γ(g)H, which implies that the image of the left coset gH under γ is the left coset γ(g)H. Therefore, γ maps the subgroup H to itself? Because if we take g = 1, then γ(1*H) = γ(1)H = H. So, γ(H) = H. Therefore, γ fixes every subgroup H of G as a set. So, γ is a subgroup-preserving permutation of G, and moreover, it acts as the identity on each subgroup? Wait, no, it fixes each subgroup as a set. That is, γ(H) = H for every subgroup H ≤ G. Because γ(1*H) = γ(1)H = H. So, γ maps H to itself. Therefore, γ permutes the elements of H, but keeps H as a set.\n\nAdditionally, since γ preserves all left cosets, for any g ∈ G, γ(gH) = γ(g)H. So, if H is normal, then the left cosets are the same as the right cosets, but here H can be any subgroup.\n\nNow, since γ fixes every subgroup H as a set, then in particular, γ fixes the center C(G) as a set. So, γ(C(G)) = C(G). Moreover, since γ is a permutation of G, it acts as a bijection on C(G). Also, since γ(1) = 1, and 1 ∈ C(G), we know that γ fixes the identity element.\n\nBut how does this help us show that γ fixes the cosets of C(G)? We need to show that for any g ∈ G, γ(g C(G)) = g C(G). Given that γ(g C(G)) = γ(g) C(G), so we need γ(g) C(G) = g C(G). Which is equivalent to γ(g) ∈ g C(G). Therefore, for each g ∈ G, there exists c ∈ C(G) such that γ(g) = g c.\n\nTo show that, we might need to use the fact that γ fixes all subgroups and preserves their cosets. Since γ fixes C(G) as a set, and also preserves the cosets, perhaps we can relate γ(g) to g via the center.\n\nLet’s consider the function f: G → C(G) defined by f(g) = g^{-1} γ(g). If we can show that f(g) ∈ C(G) for all g ∈ G, then we are done. Because then γ(g) = g f(g) with f(g) ∈ C(G).\n\nSo, let’s check if f(g) = g^{-1} γ(g) is in C(G). To do this, we need to show that for all x ∈ G, x f(g) = f(g) x.\n\nCompute x (g^{-1} γ(g)) = x g^{-1} γ(g). And (g^{-1} γ(g)) x = g^{-1} γ(g) x.\n\nWe need these to be equal. So, x g^{-1} γ(g) = g^{-1} γ(g) x. Multiply both sides on the left by g:\n\ng x g^{-1} γ(g) = γ(g) x.\n\nBut g x g^{-1} is the conjugation of x by g. Let’s denote this as g x g^{-1} = x^g. Then:\n\nx^g γ(g) = γ(g) x.\n\nSo, x^g = γ(g) x γ(g)^{-1}.\n\nBut how does this relate to the properties of γ?\n\nAlternatively, since γ preserves all left cosets, maybe we can use the fact that γ commutes with conjugation?\n\nWait, take any element x ∈ G, and consider the inner automorphism φ_x: g ↦ x g x^{-1}. We can apply γ to both sides:\n\nγ(φ_x(g)) = γ(x g x^{-1}).\n\nBut γ preserves left cosets of any subgroup, including the cyclic subgroup generated by x. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that γ preserves all subgroups, so γ(⟨x⟩) = ⟨x⟩. Therefore, γ(x) is in ⟨x⟩. Wait, is that true? If H = ⟨x⟩, then γ(H) = H. So, γ(x) ∈ H = ⟨x⟩. Therefore, γ(x) is a power of x. Similarly, γ acts on each cyclic subgroup by permuting its elements. But since γ is a bijection, it must send generators to generators. So, for each cyclic subgroup ⟨x⟩, γ(x) is a generator of ⟨x⟩, i.e., γ(x) = x or x^{-1} if the order is not 2. However, this is only true if the cyclic subgroup is of prime order. But in general, for any cyclic group, the automorphism group is the multiplicative group modulo the order. So, γ restricted to ⟨x⟩ is an automorphism of ⟨x⟩. But since γ is a permutation of G preserving all subgroups, it must act as an automorphism on each cyclic subgroup.\n\nBut wait, this seems like a big assumption. The problem doesn't state that γ preserves the group operation, only that it permutes the cosets. However, if γ preserves all cyclic subgroups, then for each x ∈ G, γ(x) ∈ ⟨x⟩. So, γ(x) = x^k for some integer k. Then, if γ is a bijection, the exponents k must be chosen such that the map is bijective. For example, in a cyclic group of order n, the automorphisms are generated by exponentiation to primes coprime to n. But in a general group, each element's cyclic subgroup is preserved, so γ acts as an automorphism on each cyclic subgroup.\n\nBut how does this help with showing that γ fixes the cosets of C(G)?\n\nIf we can show that for each g ∈ G, γ(g) = g c_g with c_g ∈ C(G), then we are done. Suppose that for each g, γ(g) = g c_g. Then, since γ preserves all left cosets, for any subgroup H, γ(g H) = γ(g) H = g c_g H. But for this to equal g H, we need c_g ∈ H. However, this must hold for all subgroups H. Wait, but c_g must be in the intersection of all subgroups H of G that contain g^{-1} γ(g). But the intersection of all subgroups containing an element is the cyclic subgroup generated by that element. So, unless c_g is the identity, this seems impossible. But this suggests that c_g must be the identity, which would mean γ is the identity permutation. But the problem does not state that γ is the identity, only that it fixes the cosets of the center.\n\nTherefore, my earlier approach might be flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: Since γ preserves all left cosets, then in particular, it preserves the left cosets of the centralizer of any element. Let’s recall that the centralizer C_G(g) of an element g ∈ G is the set of elements commuting with g. The center C(G) is the intersection of all centralizers.\n\nBut maybe we can use the fact that γ preserves the left cosets of C_G(g) for any g ∈ G. Let’s see. For any g ∈ G, C_G(g) is a subgroup, so γ permutes its left cosets. So, γ(x C_G(g)) = γ(x) C_G(g). But the left cosets of C_G(g) are in bijection with the conjugacy class of g, since the number of conjugates of g is [G : C_G(g)]. However, γ permuting these cosets might imply that it preserves the conjugacy class structure.\n\nBut how? If we take an element x C_G(g), then the elements of this coset are those h such that h g h^{-1} = x g x^{-1}. So, each coset corresponds to a particular conjugate of g. Therefore, γ permutes the conjugates of g. Therefore, γ must map the conjugacy class of g to itself. Therefore, γ preserves each conjugacy class.\n\nBut wait, if γ preserves all conjugacy classes, then for any g, γ(g) is conjugate to g. But we need to show that γ(g) is in the coset g C(G). How does being conjugate relate to the coset?\n\nIf γ(g) is conjugate to g, then there exists x ∈ G such that γ(g) = x g x^{-1}. But we need to show γ(g) ∈ g C(G), i.e., γ(g) = g c for some c ∈ C(G). So, conjugating g by x gives an element in g C(G) only if x centralizes g modulo C(G). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since γ preserves all conjugacy classes, then for each g, γ(g) is conjugate to g. Therefore, there exists x ∈ G such that γ(g) = x g x^{-1}. If we can show that x can be chosen such that x ∈ C(G), then x g x^{-1} = g, so γ(g) = g. But this would only happen if x is in the center. But we cannot assume that x is in the center.\n\nWait, but if γ(g) = x g x^{-1}, then in the quotient group Q = G/C(G), the image of γ(g) is equal to the image of x g x^{-1} which is x C(G) g C(G) x^{-1} C(G)) = (x C(G)) (g C(G)) (x C(G))^{-1}. But since Q has trivial center, the conjugacy class of g C(G) in Q is just itself if and only if g C(G) is central in Q, which it is not unless g ∈ C(G). Therefore, if Q has trivial center, then every non-central element has a non-trivial conjugacy class. But γ induces a permutation of Q that preserves the conjugacy classes. Therefore, the permutation π of Q induced by γ must send each element to a conjugate. But since Q has trivial center, the only element that is conjugate to itself is itself. Therefore, π must be the identity permutation. Therefore, γ(g) C(G) = g C(G), which is what we needed to show.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me elaborate.\n\nSince γ preserves all left cosets of all subgroups, it preserves the conjugacy classes. Because, as I mentioned earlier, the left cosets of the centralizer C_G(g) correspond to the conjugates of g. Therefore, γ permutes these conjugates, hence preserves the conjugacy class of g. Therefore, γ(g) is conjugate to g for every g ∈ G.\n\nNow, consider the image of γ(g) in the quotient group Q = G/C(G). Since Q has trivial center, the conjugacy class of q = g C(G) in Q is either trivial (if q is central) or has size >1. But since Q has trivial center, the only element with trivial conjugacy class is the identity. Therefore, if q ≠ 1, then its conjugacy class is non-trivial.\n\nBut γ(g) is conjugate to g, so the image of γ(g) in Q is conjugate to the image of g in Q. That is, π(q) = γ(g) C(G) is conjugate to q = g C(G). But in Q, if an element is conjugate to q, then unless q is central (which it isn't, since the center is trivial), the conjugacy class has size >1. However, if π is a permutation of Q induced by γ, which preserves conjugacy classes, then π must map each element to an element in its conjugacy class. But since π also preserves the group structure in some way.\n\nWait, but earlier we thought that π might be an automorphism of Q. If π is an automorphism, then since Q has trivial center, the automorphism group of Q is such that any automorphism that preserves all conjugacy classes must be inner. But in this case, π is induced by γ, which is a permutation of G, not necessarily an automorphism.\n\nAlternatively, since Q has trivial center, the only automorphism that fixes all conjugacy classes is the identity. Because if an automorphism maps each element to a conjugate, and the group has trivial center, then the automorphism must be inner. But here, we don't know if π is an automorphism. However, if π preserves the group operation, then it is an automorphism. But does π preserve the group operation?\n\nWe need to check if π(q1 q2) = π(q1) π(q2). Let’s see. Let q1 = g1 C(G), q2 = g2 C(G). Then q1 q2 = g1 g2 C(G). Then π(q1 q2) = γ(g1 g2) C(G). On the other hand, π(q1) π(q2) = γ(g1) C(G) γ(g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). So, for π to be a homomorphism, we need γ(g1 g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). This is equivalent to γ(g1 g2) ≡ γ(g1) γ(g2) mod C(G). So, γ(g1 g2) = γ(g1) γ(g2) c for some c ∈ C(G).\n\nBut how can we show this? Since γ is a permutation preserving all left cosets, perhaps we can relate this to the multiplication in G.\n\nLet’s take H = G. Then, γ(g G) = γ(g) G. Not helpful.\n\nTake H = C(G). Then, γ(g1 g2 C(G)) = γ(g1 g2) C(G). But also, since γ preserves left cosets, γ(g1 g2 C(G)) = γ(g1 g2) C(G). On the other hand, if we consider the product of cosets q1 q2 = g1 C(G) g2 C(G) = g1 g2 C(G). If π is a homomorphism, then π(q1 q2) = π(q1) π(q2), which gives the condition γ(g1 g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). Therefore, π is a homomorphism if and only if γ(g1 g2) ≡ γ(g1) γ(g2) mod C(G).\n\nSo, to prove that π is a homomorphism, we need this condition. But how?\n\nLet’s try to compute γ(g1 g2). Since γ preserves all left cosets, consider the left coset of the subgroup generated by g2. Let’s take H = ⟨g2⟩. Then, γ(g1 H) = γ(g1) H. Therefore, γ(g1 g2^k) = γ(g1) g2^{m} for some m. But since H is cyclic, and γ permutes its elements, the image of g1 H under γ is γ(g1) H. Therefore, γ(g1 g2) must be in γ(g1) H. So, γ(g1 g2) = γ(g1) g2^{m} for some m. But this must hold for any g1 and g2. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since γ preserves all left cosets, for any g ∈ G and any subgroup H, γ(g H) = γ(g) H. This is similar to a homomorphism, but with H on the right instead of γ(H). If γ were a homomorphism, then γ(g H) = γ(g) γ(H). But here, it's γ(g) H. So, unless γ(H) = H, which we know is true, but still, the difference is that the image of the coset is γ(g) H instead of γ(g) γ(H).\n\nBut since γ(H) = H, then γ(g H) = γ(g) H. So, for any H ≤ G, γ acts as a permutation on G/H, the set of left cosets, by sending gH to γ(g)H. Therefore, γ induces a automorphism of the coset space G/H. But in general, this doesn't necessarily correspond to a group automorphism unless H is normal and we consider the quotient group.\n\nBut in our case, H = C(G) is normal, so G/C(G) is a group. The permutation π of G/C(G) induced by γ is a permutation that preserves the group operation if and only if γ(g1 g2) C(G) = γ(g1) γ(g2) C(G). As we saw earlier.\n\nBut how to show that this holds? Maybe use the fact that γ preserves all left cosets, including those of the form g1 g2 C(G). But I don't see the connection.\n\nWait, another idea: consider that for any g ∈ G, γ(g) ∈ g C(G). If we can show this, then we are done. So, assume for contradiction that there exists g ∈ G such that γ(g) ∉ g C(G). Then, γ(g) C(G) ≠ g C(G). But since γ permutes the left cosets of C(G), this would mean that π_{C(G)} is a non-trivial permutation of G/C(G). However, if we can show that any permutation of G/C(G) induced by γ must be the identity, then we reach a contradiction.\n\nTo show that π_{C(G)} is the identity, note that Q = G/C(G) has trivial center. Suppose π is a non-trivial permutation of Q. Since π is a permutation induced by γ, which preserves all conjugacy classes (as γ preserves all left cosets of centralizers, hence preserves conjugacy classes), then π must preserve the conjugacy classes of Q. But since Q has trivial center, the only way π can preserve all conjugacy classes is if it maps each element to itself. Because in a group with trivial center, the only element in its own conjugacy class is the identity. For non-identity elements, their conjugacy classes have size greater than 1. Therefore, if π preserves conjugacy classes, it must map each element to itself. Hence, π is the identity permutation.\n\nTherefore, π_{C(G)} is the identity, which means γ(g) C(G) = g C(G) for all g ∈ G, which is what we needed to prove.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. γ preserves all left cosets, hence preserves conjugacy classes in G.\n\n2. The permutation π induced by γ on Q = G/C(G) preserves the conjugacy classes of Q.\n\n3. Since Q has trivial center, the only way π can preserve conjugacy classes is by fixing each element.\n\n4. Hence, γ fixes each coset of C(G).\n\nThis completes the proof.",
