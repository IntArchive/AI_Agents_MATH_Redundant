    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. So the user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the ratio of two infinite series A and B equals 2x/(2x-1) for every integer x ≥ 2. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that x is an integer and x is greater than or equal to 2. Then, there are the definitions of A and B as infinite series. The problem is to show that 2x/(2x-1) equals A/B. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in this case, the first assumption is that x is an integer. The second assumption is that x is at least 2. Then, A and B are defined as specific infinite series, so those would be separate assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variables and their conditions. Here, A and B are defined in terms of x, so maybe the definitions of A and B are part of the problem statement rather than assumptions. But the problem's assumptions should include all given conditions. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The user listed two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer. Then, perhaps in the example, the second assumption was redundant, but maybe the user included it as a condition. Wait, no, the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it was to prove divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13). So maybe the example had a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the format.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions should include that x is an integer, x ≥ 2, and the definitions of A and B as given in equations (1) and (2). Wait, but in the example, the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem didn't state that. So perhaps the example is wrong. Wait, maybe the example was for a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\". Therefore, the example might be incorrect, but the user's instruction is to follow the format, so perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are x is an integer, x ≥ 2, A is defined as the sum in equation (1), B is defined as the sum in equation (2). Each of these should be separate lines in the Assumption section.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption 2: x ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption 3: A = 1 + (x-1)/(x+1) + (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)] + ... (as in equation 1).\n\nAssumption 4: B = 1 + (x-2)/x + (x-2)(x-3)/[x(x+1)] + ... (as in equation 2).\n\nThen the problem is to show that (2x)/(2x -1) = A/B.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about properties of the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the definitions of A and B are part of the problem setup, so they should be included as assumptions. Each assumption is a single line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each of these as separate assumptions. Let me check if the user's example included definitions as assumptions. In the example, the original problem defined A(n) as a certain expression, and in the formatted problem, they included the expression as part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem says \"Problem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So the definition of A(n) is part of the problem statement. Similarly, in the current problem, the definitions of A and B are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem statement included the definition of A(n). So perhaps in this case, the definitions of A and B are part of the problem statement, and the assumptions are the conditions on x. Therefore, the assumptions should be x is an integer, x ≥ 2, and the problem is to show that 2x/(2x-1) = A/B where A and B are defined as in equations (1) and (2).\n\nBut the example's formatted problem included the expression of A(n) within the problem statement, not in the assumptions. So perhaps the current problem's assumptions are only the conditions on x, and the definitions of A and B are part of the problem's statement. Let me look at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might be incorrect. Maybe the example is flawed. However, following the user's instruction, I need to structure the current problem accordingly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original question starts with \"Let x ≥ 2 denote an integer.\" So that's two assumptions: x is an integer, and x ≥ 2. Then, the definitions of A and B are given in equations (1) and (2). The problem is to show that 2x/(2x-1) = A/B. Therefore, the assumptions should list the conditions on x, and the problem statement includes the definitions of A and B and the required proof.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem statement included the definition of A(n). So following that pattern, in the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption: x ≥ 2.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that 2x/(2x -1) = A/B, where A is defined as [equation (1)] and B is defined as [equation (2)].\n\nBut the user's example included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. So perhaps in this case, the problem statement should include the definitions of A and B as part of the problem, not the assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are only about x being an integer and x ≥ 2. Then the problem statement includes defining A and B and asking for the ratio.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user wrote \"Let x≥2 denote an integer. Consider: [A defined as (1)] and [B defined as (2)]. How does one show that 2x/(2x-1)=A/B?\" So the assumptions are that x is an integer, x≥2, and A and B are defined as those series. So each of these is an assumption. But according to the user's example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption: x ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: A is defined as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of the product from k=0 to n of (x - k)/(x + k).\n\nAssumption: B is defined as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of the product from k=0 to n of (x - 2 - k)/(x + k - 2) ??? Wait, let me check the original definitions.\n\nOriginal problem's equations (1) and (2):\n\nEquation (1) (A): 1 + (x-1)/(x+1) + (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)] + ... \n\nThis can be written as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of product_{k=0}^n (x -1 -k)/(x +1 +k - 0)? Wait, let's see:\n\nFirst term (n=0): 1 = product_{k=0}^0 (x -k)/(x +k) ? Wait, no. Wait, the first term is 1. Then for n=1, the term is (x-1)/(x+1). For n=2, (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)], etc. So in general, for each term in A, the nth term (starting from n=0) is product_{k=0}^n (x -1 -k)/(x +1 +k). Wait, let's check:\n\nAt n=0: term is 1. If k ranges from 0 to 0, then product is (x -1 -0)/(x +1 +0) = (x -1)/(x +1), but the first term is 1. So perhaps there's a shift. Wait, the original problem's equation (1) starts with 1, then adds (x-1)/(x+1), etc. So maybe A is written as sum_{n=0}^infty product_{k=0}^n (x - (k +1))/(x + (k +1)) ? Because for n=0: term is 1 (product from k=0 to 0 would be (x -1)/(x +1), but that's not the first term. Wait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the nth term in A is product_{m=1}^n (x - m)/(x + m). So when n=0, term is 1. For n=1, (x -1)/(x +1). For n=2, (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)], etc. So yes, A can be written as sum_{n=0}^∞ product_{m=1}^n (x - m)/(x + m). Similarly for B.\n\nBut in the user's problem statement, they rephrased A and B using the Pochhammer symbols. The user's attempt mentions (x)_n and (x)^n, which are the falling and rising factorials. So in equation (3), A is written as x + (x)_2/(x)^2 + (x)_3/(x)^3 + ... So perhaps there's a different way to express A and B.\n\nBut for the purpose of structuring the problem, the exact definitions of A and B as per equations (1) and (2) should be included. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption: x ≥ 2.\n\nAssumption: A is the series defined by equation (1): 1 + (x-1)/(x+1) + (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)] + ... \n\nAssumption: B is the series defined by equation (2): 1 + (x-2)/x + (x-2)(x-3)/[x(x+1)] + ... \n\nEach of these should be separate lines in the assumptions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement includes the definition of A(n). So perhaps the problem statement here should include the definitions of A and B. However, the user's example shows that the problem statement includes the expression of A(n), but in the formatted problem, the assumptions are about the variables. So in this case, the problem statement is to prove that 2x/(2x -1) = A/B given the definitions of A and B as per equations (1) and (2). Therefore, the assumptions are about x being an integer and x ≥ 2, and the definitions of A and B are part of the problem statement. Wait, but the example included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(...) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\n\nAssumption: n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. However, perhaps the user intended that the formatted problem's assumptions are the conditions given in the original problem, and any additional constraints. But in the original problem here, there are no additional constraints beyond x being an integer and x ≥ 2.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- x is an integer.\n\n- x ≥ 2.\n\nAnd the problem is to show that 2x/(2x-1) = A/B, where A and B are defined as in equations (1) and (2).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user included the definitions of A and B in the question. So to follow the example's structure, perhaps the definitions of A and B are part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption: x ≥ 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2x/(2x -1) = A/B, where A is defined as [equation (1)] and B is defined as [equation (2)].\n\nAlternatively, the definitions of A and B could be part of the problem statement. But according to the user's example, the problem statement includes the expression of A(n). So in this case, the problem would be:\n\nProve that 2x/(2x -1) = A/B, where \nA = 1 + (x-1)/(x+1) + (x-1)(x-2)/[(x+1)(x+2)] + ... \nand \nB = 1 + (x-2)/x + (x-2)(x-3)/[x(x+1)] + ... \n\nBut the user's example wrote the problem as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So the expression is included in the problem statement. Therefore, the current problem's formatted version should include the definitions of A and B in the problem statement, and the assumptions are about x.\n\nThus, the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption: x is an integer.\n\nAssumption: x ≥ 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that (2x)/(2x -1) = A/B, where \nA = 1 + (x-1)/(x+1) + [(x-1)(x-2)]/[(x+1)(x+2)] + ⋯ \nand \nB = 1 + (x-2)/x + [(x-2)(x-3)]/[x(x+1)] + ⋯.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single line, and the problem statement includes the definitions of A and B as given in the original question.\n\nAdditionally, the user's example did not include the definitions in the assumptions but included them in the problem. Hence, this seems consistent.",
