    "Content": "In Abbot's Understanding Analysis I am asked to show that $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ is an algebraic number. I have shown that those two are algebraic separately (that was simple), but I can't figure out what to do to show that their sum is algebraic, too. For example, I tried $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^{2}=5+\\sqrt{24}$ and then I tried to think of a polynomial of form $ax^2-bx^{0}=0$ e.g. $c(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})^{2}-c(5+\\sqrt{24})=0$ that would work, but couldn't find the $c$ value that would make $b=c(5+\\sqrt{24})$ integer, but couldn't find one. Maybe I can somehow conjecture that the sum of two algebraic numbers must be algebraic, too, but I was wondering if there's a way to find a polynomial to show this. Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $x=\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$. Note that $x^2=2+2\\sqrt{6}+3$ and therefore $x^2-5=2\\sqrt{6}$. We can square both sides of this equation and obtain $(x^2-5)^2=24$. You should now be able to show that $x$ is an algebraic number (over $\\mathbb{Q}$). (In fact, it is instructive to expand this equation and obtain a monic polynomial $p$ of degree $4$ such that $p(x)=0$.) The following exercises are relevant: Example-Based Exercises : Exercise 1 : Prove that the following numbers are algebraic (over $\\mathbb{Q}$): (a) $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5}$ (b) $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{4}$ (c) $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt[3]{3}$ The degree of an algebraic number $x$ is defined to be the least positive integer $n$ such that there is a monic polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ with $p(x)=0$. Compute the degrees of each of the algebraic numbers above (in (a) , (b) and (c) ). Prove that your answer is correct in each case. Exercise 2 : Let $p_1,\\dots,p_n$ be distinct (positive) prime numbers. Prove that the number $x=\\sqrt{p_1}+\\cdots+\\sqrt{p_n}$ is algebraic. What is the degree of $x$? Exercise 3 : Let $x$ be an algebraic number and let $q$ be a rational number. Prove that the degree of $x$ equals the degree of $x+q$. Exercise 4 : Let $x=\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ for some positive integer $n$. Is $x$ algebraic (over $\\mathbb{Q}$)? If not, prove it, and if so find the degree of $x$. (Your answer will depend on $n$.) Theoretical Exercises : Exercise 5 : Let $x\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and define $\\mathbb{Q}[x]=\\{f(x):f\\text{ is a polynomial with rational coefficients}\\}$. (a) Prove that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $x$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. (Hint (for one direction): if $x$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and if $a_0+a_1x+\\cdots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^n=0$ where $a_i\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ for all $0\\leq i\\leq n$, show that $\\{1,x,x^2,\\dots,x^{n-1}\\}$ spans $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space.) (b) Prove that $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a field if $x$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. (Hint: it suffices to prove that $x$ has a multiplicative inverse. Let $p$ be a monic polynomial of minimal degree (with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$) such that $p(x)=0$. Prove that $p(0)\\neq 0$ if $x\\neq 0$.) (c) Prove that if $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq K\\subseteq L$ is a tower of fields and if $K$ is a finite dimensional $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space, $L$ is a finite dimensional $K$-vector space, then $L$ is a finite dimensional $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. (d) Prove that the sum and product of two algebraic numbers (over $\\mathbb{Q}$) is algebraic. (Hint: if $x$ and $y$ are algebraic, use (c) to show that $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]=\\{f(x,y):f\\text{ is a polynomial in two variables with rational coefficients}\\}$ is a finite dimensional $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. (a) is relevant.) Challenge : If $x$ and $y$ are algebraic numbers (over $\\mathbb{Q}$), can you find an explicit polynomial $p$ with rational coefficients such that $p(x+y)=0$? Can you find an explicit polynomial $q$ with rational coefficients such that $q(xy)=0$? I hope this helps!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that √2 + √3 is algebraic. They mentioned that they know √2 and √3 are algebraic separately, which makes sense because each satisfies a polynomial equation (x² - 2 = 0 and x² - 3 = 0 respectively). But they're stuck on showing the sum is algebraic.\n\nIn their attempt, they squared (√2 + √3) and got 5 + √24. Then they tried to form a polynomial but couldn't find the right coefficients. Let me think. Squaring gives 5 + 2√6, wait, actually (√2 + √3)² = 2 + 2√6 + 3 = 5 + 2√6, not √24. Wait, 2√6 is √24? Because √24 is 2√6. So that part is correct. So they have x² = 5 + √24. Then they need to eliminate the radical. So maybe they can rearrange and square again. Let's set x = √2 + √3. Then x² = 5 + 2√6. If I isolate the radical: x² - 5 = 2√6. Then square both sides: (x² - 5)² = (2√6)² → x⁴ -10x² +25 = 24 → x⁴ -10x² +1 = 0. So that's a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, x is algebraic. So the polynomial is x⁴ -10x² +1. Therefore, the answer should be that polynomial. \n\nBut wait, the user tried to use a quadratic polynomial but couldn't find the right c. Maybe they didn't consider squaring twice. The key is to start with x = √2 + √3, then square to get rid of the square roots step by step. Each time there's a radical left, you square again. Here, after squaring once, we still have a √6, so isolating it and squaring again removes the radical, leading to a quartic equation. \n\nSo the assumptions here are that √2 and √3 are algebraic, which they already established, but the problem specifically asks about their sum. The problem doesn't state any restrictions, so the main assumption is that we're dealing with the sum of these two algebraic numbers. The problem is to show that this sum is algebraic by finding a polynomial with integer coefficients that it satisfies. \n\nTherefore, in the format requested, the assumptions would be that √2 and √3 are algebraic numbers, and the problem is to show their sum is algebraic by finding such a polynomial. However, the original problem in the example didn't list the separate algebraic nature as assumptions, but maybe here we need to state them. Wait, looking at the example provided, the user included the assumptions as specific conditions. In the example, they had \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, maybe the assumptions are that √2 and √3 are algebraic. But the problem is to show their sum is algebraic. However, the original question in the example didn't list the algebraic nature of √2 and √3 as assumptions, but perhaps the user wants the structured problem to list any necessary conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had to do with divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the user is just asked to show the sum is algebraic. The given problem's assumptions might be implicit, like √2 and √3 are algebraic, but perhaps the problem doesn't require those as explicit assumptions because the question is to show the sum is algebraic regardless. Wait, the problem as stated in the original question is: \"show that √2 + √3 is algebraic.\" So the only assumption is that √2 and √3 are real numbers (which they are), but the problem is to demonstrate the sum is algebraic. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables. Maybe here, the assumptions are that √2 and √3 are algebraic, but since the problem is to show their sum is algebraic, perhaps the problem itself doesn't require those as assumptions because the question is to prove it regardless. Hmm. The example given by the user included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed the assumption to n being an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. Let me check again: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps the user intended to filter unrelated information but made a mistake. Anyway, following the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the format. The original problem is: \"Show that √2 + √3 is algebraic.\" So the assumptions here are that √2 and √3 are real numbers (which are algebraic), but since the problem is to show their sum is algebraic, perhaps the assumptions should be the algebraic nature of √2 and √3. But in the example, they included the conditions on n. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions here other than the definitions. The problem is simply to prove that the sum is algebraic. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is empty, but the user's example included assumptions even when the problem didn't state them. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the user intended to include all necessary conditions. But in this current problem, there are no explicit conditions given; the problem is straightforward. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are that √2 and √3 are algebraic numbers. But the problem is to show their sum is algebraic. However, the problem may not require those as assumptions because the user is supposed to know that √2 and √3 are algebraic. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions beyond the basic definitions. So, following the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions are that √2 and √3 are algebraic numbers. Then the problem is to show their sum is algebraic. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, perhaps the only assumption is that √2 and √3 are algebraic, but the problem is to show their sum is algebraic. But the problem as stated in the user's question is just \"show that √2 + √3 is algebraic.\" So maybe the formatted problem should have no assumptions, but the example had some. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should include the necessary assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been an error. But perhaps the user intended to capture the necessary conditions. In this case, since the problem is to show the sum is algebraic, the necessary assumptions would be that √2 and √3 are algebraic, but that's part of the problem's context. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical definitions. The problem is to demonstrate that a specific number is algebraic. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section is empty. However, the example included assumptions, so maybe I should list the necessary ones. Let me see. If we follow the example's approach, the problem is \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But in the original problem, the user was asked to prove for every integer n, so adding \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example was wrong, but the user wants the assistant to follow that structure. In this current problem, perhaps the assumptions are that √2 and √3 are algebraic numbers. But the problem is to show their sum is algebraic. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n√2 is an algebraic number,\n√3 is an algebraic number.\nProblem:\nShow that √2 + √3 is algebraic.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find a polynomial, maybe the assumptions are just that √2 and √3 exist as real numbers. But I think the key assumptions here are that √2 and √3 are algebraic, which is already known, and the problem is to show the sum is algebraic. However, since the problem is to show that the sum is algebraic, perhaps the assumptions are not needed because the problem is self-contained. But according to the example, even if the original problem didn't state assumptions, the formatted version included some. Therefore, to adhere to the user's example, maybe list the assumptions that √2 and √3 are algebraic. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\n√2 is an algebraic number,\n√3 is an algebraic number.\nProblem:\nShow that √2 + √3 is algebraic by finding a polynomial with integer coefficients it satisfies.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention finding a polynomial, just showing it's algebraic. However, the user's attempt tried to find a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is implicitly to find such a polynomial. But the original problem states: \"show that √2 + √3 is an algebraic number.\" The answer is to find a polynomial, so the problem is as stated. Therefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions as above and the problem as stated. However, in the example, the problem included the expression and the divisibility. So perhaps the correct formatted version here is:\n\nAssumption:\n√2 is an algebraic number,\n√3 is an algebraic number.\nProblem:\nShow that √2 + √3 is algebraic.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable n, which is part of the problem's statement. Here, maybe the assumptions are not necessary, but according to the user's example, they included assumptions even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake, but we need to follow it. Given the user's example included assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem was for every integer n, perhaps in this case, we need to include assumptions like √2 and √3 are algebraic. However, since the problem is to show their sum is algebraic, and given that the user already knows they're algebraic separately, maybe those are the assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would list those two as assumptions and the problem as stated.",
