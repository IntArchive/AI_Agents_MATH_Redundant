    "Content": "Prove that the function $x \\mapsto \\dfrac 1{1+ x^2}$ is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ . Attempt: By definition a function $f: E →\\Bbb R$ is uniformly continuous iff for every $ε > 0$ , there is a $δ > 0$ such that $|x-a| < δ$ and $x,a$ are elements of $E$ implies $|f(x) - f(a)| < ε.$ Then suppose $x, a$ are elements of $\\Bbb R. $ Now \\begin{align}\n|f(x) - f(a)| \n&= \\left|\\frac1{1 + x^2} - \\frac1{1 + a^2}\\right|\n\\\\&= \\left|  \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)}\\right|\n\\\\&= |x - a| \\frac{|x + a|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)}\n\\\\&≤ |x - a| \\frac{|x| + |a|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)}\n\\\\&= |x - a| \\left[\\frac{|x|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)} + \\frac{|a|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)}\\right]\n\\end{align} I don't know how to simplify more. Can someone please help me finish? Thank very much.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are nearly finishing the proof. $$|x - a| (\\frac{|x|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)} + \\frac{|a|}{(1 + x^2)(1 + a^2)})\\le |x - a| (\\frac{1}{2(1 + a^2)} + \\frac{1}{2(1 + x^2)})\\le |x-a|$$ Take $\\delta=\\epsilon$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the function f(x) = 1/(1 + x²) is uniformly continuous on ℝ. The user attempted the proof by starting with the definition of uniform continuity and manipulating the expression |f(x) - f(a)|. They got to a point where they have |x - a| multiplied by some fraction involving |x| and |a|, and they're stuck on simplifying further.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The function is given as x ↦ 1/(1 + x²), and the domain is all real numbers. The problem is to show uniform continuity on ℝ. The assumptions should be line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. So, the main objects here are the function f and the domain ℝ. The function's definition is f(x) = 1/(1 + x²). The domain is all real numbers. The problem is about uniform continuity. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is a function defined by f(x) = 1/(1 + x²).\n- The domain of f is ℝ.\n- The problem requires proving uniform continuity.\n\nBut wait, the example given had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7. In this case, the assumptions here are inherent to the problem statement. The problem states \"Prove that the function x ↦ 1/(1 + x²) is uniformly continuous on ℝ.\" So the key elements are the definition of f, its domain, and the property to prove (uniform continuity). The user's attempt also mentions the definition of uniform continuity, but that's part of the problem-solving process, not an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = 1/(1 + x²),\nThe domain of f is ℝ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is uniformly continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut the example had multiple assumptions listed line by line. In the original problem here, the function is defined as such, and the domain is specified. So each of these is a separate assumption. The function's definition is one assumption, the domain is another. The problem is to prove uniform continuity. The user's attempt includes calculations, but those are part of their solution attempt and not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem's own assumptions are just the function's form and its domain. There's no additional condition like in the example where n was an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is straightforward: given this function on ℝ, show it's uniformly continuous. So the assumptions are two: function definition and domain. The problem is to prove uniform continuity. That should be it.",
