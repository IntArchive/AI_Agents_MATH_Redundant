    "AcceptedAnswer": "3rd edit: I have now typed things up in a slightly more streamlined way: http://relaunch.hcm.uni-bonn.de/fileadmin/geschke/papers/ConvexOpen.pdf Old answer: How about this:  Call a set $U\\subseteq\\mathbb R^n$  star-shaped\nif there is a point $x\\in U$ such that for all lines $g$ through\n$x$, $g\\cap U$ is a connected open line segment.\nEvery convex set is star-shaped.\nTranslating $U$ if necessary we may assume that $x=0$.\nNow use arctan to map $U$ homeomorphically to a bounded set.\nThis set is still star-shaped around $x=0$. Now scale each ray from $0$ to the boundary of the open \nset appropriately, obtaining a homeomorphism from the open set onto\nthe open unit ball. Edit:  I am very sorry that I didn't reply to the comments earlier.\nIt seems that my answer was too sketchy.  I think we agree that we can assume that the origin is an element of the original open set $U$.\nAs Henning Makholm points out, we use arctan applied to the radius in Polar coordinates to map our potentially unbounded set $U$ to a bounded open set $V$. Now we show that in any direction the distance of the boundary of $V$ \nfrom the origin depends continuously on that direction. Let $v$ be a direction, i.e., let $v$ be a vector in $\\mathbb R^n$ of length $1$. First case: the ray from the origin in the direction of $v$ is contained in $U$.\nIn this case $U$ is unbounded in the direction of $v$.\nSince $U$ is open, there is $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the $\\varepsilon$-ball around the origin is still contained in $U$.  Since $U$ is convex, the convex hull of the union of the ray in the direction of $v$ and the open $\\varepsilon$-ball is also contained in $U$.  Let us call this convex open set $C$. For every $N>0$ the set of elements of $C$ that have distance at least $N$ from the origin is open.  It follows that the set of directions $v'$ such that the\nray in direction $v'$ has elements of $C$ of distance at least $N$ from the origin is open. But this implies that the map assigning to each direction $v$ the distance of the boundary of the transformed set  $V$ to the origin in that direction is actually continuous in all the directions in which the original set $U$ is unbounded. Second case: the ray from the origin in the direction $v$ is not contained in\n$U$, i.e., $U$ is bounded in the direction of $v$.\nWe have to show that the distance of the boundary of the transformed set \n$V$ in some direction $v'$ is continuous in $v$. But since arctan is continuous, it is enough to show the same statement for\nthe distance to the boundary of the original set $U$. So, let $d$ be the distance of the boundary of $U$ from the origin in the direction of $v$.\nLet $\\varepsilon>0$.  Choose $x\\in U$ in the direction $v$ such that \n$d-|x|<\\varepsilon/2$.  For some $\\delta>0$, the $\\delta$-ball around $x$ is contained in $U$.  The set of directions $v'$ such that the ray in that direction passed through the open ball of radius $\\delta$ around $x$ is an open \nset of directions containing $v$.  It follows that on an open set of directions\ncontaining $v$ the distance of the boundary of $U$ is at least $d-\\varepsilon$. Now let $x$ be a point on the ray in the direction of $v$ with $|x|>d$.\nIf we can show that $x$ is not in the closure of $U$, then there is an open ball around $x$ that is disjoint from $U$ and we see that there an open set of directions that contains $v$ such that for all directions $v'$ in that set \nthe distance of the boundary in direction $v'$ from the origin is at most\n$|x|$.  This shows that the map assigning the distance of the boundary of $U$ to\nthe direction is continuous in $v$ and we are done. So it remains to show that $x$ is not in the closure of $U$.\nWe assume it is.\nLet $y$ be the point on the ray in direction $v$ that satisfies $|y|=d$.\n$y$ is on the boundary of $U$.  Then $|y|<|x|$.\nLet $B$ be an open ball around the origin contained in $U$.\nWe may assume that $x\\not in B$.\nNow I am waving my hands a bit, but I think this should be clear:\nThere is some $\\varepsilon>0$ such that when $|x-z|<\\varepsilon$, then $y$ is in the convex hull $C_z$ of the union of $B$ and $\\{z\\}$.\nNow choose $z\\in U$ such that $|x-z|<\\varepsilon$.\nNow $y\\in C_z$ and by the convexity of $U$, $C_z\\subseteq U$.\nBut $C_z\\setminus\\{z\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $y$.\nThis shows that $y$ is not on the boundary of $U$, a contradiction. This finishes the proof of \"continuity of scaling\".  I hope this was comprehensible. 2nd edit:  It doesn't seem clear why the map $d$ assigning to each direction $v$ the distance of the boundary of $V$ from the origin in direction $v$ is well defined.  For $v\\in\\mathbb R^n$ of length $1$ (i.e., $v$ a direction) let\n$$d(v)=\\inf\\{|x|:x\\in\\mathbb R^n\\setminus V\\wedge x/|x|=v\\}.$$\nSince $V$ is bounded, this is well defined.  I take that as the definition of\n\"the distance from the origin of the boundary of $V$ in the direction of $v$\".  In the \"so it remains to show\"-paragraph above it is shown that no point $x$ in the direction of $v$ with $d(v)<|x|$ is in the closure of $V$. (Strictly speaking, I prove this for $U$ instead of $V$, and only in the case that the ray in direction $v$ is not contained in $U$.  But if the ray is not contained in $U$, the arctan transformation preserves the property that we have shown for $U$.   If the ray is contained in $U$, then $d(v)$ is $\\pi/2$ and\nthe point $\\pi v/2$ is the unique point on the boundary of $V$ in the direction of $v$.\nThe problem with $U$ is that it is unbounded and hence we might be taking the infimum over the empty set.  In this case the distance would be $\\infty$.)\nIt follows that the unique point $y$ in the direction of $v$ with $|y|=d(v)$ is in the boundary of $V$.  Hence every ray through the origin intersects the boundary of $V$ in exactly one point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem from Kelley's book. The task is to prove that all convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic. Hmm, first, I need to recall what convex and open mean in this context. A convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the entire line segment connecting them is also within the set. Open means that around every point, there's an ε-ball entirely contained in the set. \n\nThe example mentioned uses the arctan function in ℝ¹, which probably refers to showing that open intervals are homeomorphic to ℝ. For example, using arctan to map ℝ to (-π/2, π/2), which is an open interval. But in higher dimensions, it's more complicated. \n\nI remember that in ℝⁿ, a common technique to show two spaces are homeomorphic is to find a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse. For convex open sets, maybe there's a way to map them to the entire space ℝⁿ. But how?\n\nFirst, consider the simplest case: ℝⁿ itself is convex and open. So it's trivially homeomorphic to itself. Then, what about an open ball centered at the origin? An open ball is convex and open. There's a standard homeomorphism between the open ball and ℝⁿ, like using the function x ↦ x/(1 - ||x||) which maps the open unit ball to ℝⁿ. Similarly, maybe any convex open set can be mapped to the open ball, and then to ℝⁿ, hence all convex open sets are homeomorphic.\n\nBut wait, the problem says all convex open sets are homeomorphic. So does that mean any convex open set in ℝⁿ is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ? Or that all convex open sets are homeomorphic to each other? Because in ℝ¹, all open intervals are homeomorphic to each other and to ℝ. In higher dimensions, if all convex open sets are homeomorphic, then they must all be homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. \n\nBut wait, is every convex open set in ℝⁿ homeomorphic to ℝⁿ? For example, an open cube in ℝ³ is convex and open. Is it homeomorphic to ℝ³? Yes, because it's an open ball in another norm, and all norms on ℝⁿ are equivalent in terms of topology. So maybe the key is that any convex open set can be mapped to the unit ball via some radial scaling, preserving convexity, and then the unit ball is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ via the standard map.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the concept of star-shaped sets. A convex set is star-shaped with respect to any of its points. There's a theorem that star-shaped open sets are homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. So perhaps that's the approach.\n\nBut the user wants to structure the problem as per the given format. Let's look at the example again. The original problem had an assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove the expression is divisible by 91. So in the current problem, the assumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem here is to prove that convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The set is a subset of ℝⁿ.\n2. The set is convex.\n3. The set is open.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to the set. The problem is to prove that such sets are homeomorphic. Wait, but the original problem might be to prove that any two convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic, or that each convex open set is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. The question is a bit ambiguous. The user's example was about divisibility, but here the problem's exact statement is a bit unclear from the original question.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Proof that convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic?\" The title is phrased as a question. The user says it's from Kelley's book and asks for a proof. The way it's phrased, it's likely that the problem is to show that any convex open set in ℝⁿ is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. Alternatively, that any two convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic. The answer would depend on that.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption was that n is an integer divisible by 7. So similarly, here the assumptions would be that the set is convex, open, and in ℝⁿ. The problem is to prove they're homeomorphic. But homeomorphic to what? The question says \"are homeomorphic,\" which could mean to each other. So the problem is to show that all convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic to each other, hence to ℝⁿ.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The set is a subset of ℝⁿ.\n- The set is convex.\n- The set is open.\n\nProblem: Prove that the set is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is that all convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic to each other, then the problem statement should reflect that. But the original question's title is \"Proof that convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic?\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, in topology, when you say a class of sets are homeomorphic, it usually means that any two sets in the class are homeomorphic to each other. So the problem is to prove that any two convex open subsets of ℝⁿ are homeomorphic.\n\nBut wait, in ℝⁿ, all open balls are homeomorphic to each other and to ℝⁿ. Similarly, any convex open set can be homeomorphic to an open ball, hence to ℝⁿ, hence to each other. So the key steps would be:\n\n1. Show that any convex open set is homeomorphic to the unit open ball in ℝⁿ.\n2. Since all open balls are homeomorphic to ℝⁿ, hence all convex open sets are homeomorphic to ℝⁿ and thus to each other.\n\nTherefore, the problem statement is to prove that every convex open set in ℝⁿ is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ (which implies they are all homeomorphic to each other). \n\nSo, structuring the problem accordingly:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set is a subset of ℝⁿ.\n- The set is convex.\n- The set is open.\n\nProblem: Prove that the set is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is that all convex open sets are homeomorphic to each other, the problem statement would be that. But given the example provided, where the problem was about divisibility by 91, the key is to list all the assumptions and the problem. The original problem here, from the user, is to show that convex open sets in ℝⁿ are homeomorphic. So the problem is to prove that any convex open set in ℝⁿ is homeomorphic to ℝⁿ. Hence, the formatted problem would have the three assumptions and the problem statement as proving homeomorphism to ℝⁿ.",
