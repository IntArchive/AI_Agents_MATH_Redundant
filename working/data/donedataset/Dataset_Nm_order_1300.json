    "Content": "In the proof here a strictly positive function in $(0,\\pi)$ is integrated over this interval and the integral is claimed as a positive number. It seems intuitively obvious as the area enclosed by a continuous function's graph lying entirely above the x-axis and the x-axis should not be zero. But how can I prove this formally? If the function is positive over a closed interval apparently the result is not true (link goes to page 147 in Theories of Integration by Kurtz and Swarz). This has further confused me. Can someone please clarify my doubt. Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $f : I \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function on some interval $I$. If $f$ is continuous and positive on $I$, then $\\displaystyle \\int_I f >0$. Indeed, $f \\geq \\alpha >0$ on some closed interval $K \\subset I$, so $\\displaystyle \\int_I f \\geq \\int_K f \\geq \\alpha \\cdot \\mu(K)>0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether the Riemann integral of a strictly positive function over an interval is positive. They mentioned an example where a function is strictly positive on (0, π) and the integral is claimed positive. The user is confused because they found a reference where, even if a function is positive on a closed interval, the integral might not be positive. Hmm, I need to clarify this.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions. A function f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] if the upper and lower integrals are equal. The integral is then that common value. Now, if f is strictly positive on [a, b], meaning f(x) > 0 for all x in [a, b], does that guarantee the integral is positive?\n\nWait, but the user mentioned a function positive on (0, π), which is an open interval. Maybe the function is zero at the endpoints? Like, if the function is positive on (0, π) but f(0) = f(π) = 0. Then, integrating over [0, π], the function is non-negative everywhere, but strictly positive in the interior. In that case, is the integral still positive?\n\nThe user also refers to a book where apparently even if a function is positive on a closed interval, the integral might not be positive. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the function in the book example is not Riemann integrable? Or maybe it's a function that's positive but not bounded away from zero? Because if a function is continuous on [a, b] and positive, then it's bounded away from zero, so the integral should be positive. But if the function is just Riemann integrable and positive everywhere, but can get arbitrarily close to zero, then maybe the integral could be zero? Wait, is that possible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose f is non-negative on [a, b] and Riemann integrable. The integral is zero if and only if the set of points where f is positive has measure zero. So if f is strictly positive on a set of positive measure, then the integral should be positive. But if a function is strictly positive everywhere on [a, b], then the set where it's positive is the entire interval, which has measure b - a > 0. Therefore, the integral should be positive. But the user says that in the book, it's claimed that even if the function is positive on a closed interval, the integral might not be positive. That must be under different assumptions, maybe the function isn't Riemann integrable? Or maybe the book is using a different type of integral?\n\nWait, the book is \"Theories of Integration\" by Kurtz and Swarz, page 147. Without looking it up, maybe they discuss different types of integrals where this can happen. For example, in the context of the Riemann integral, if the function is positive everywhere on [a, b], then the integral must be positive. However, perhaps the example in the book is about a function that's positive on a closed interval but not Riemann integrable, so the integral isn't defined? Or maybe it's a function that's positive but has discontinuities on a set of positive measure, making it non-integrable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is positive almost everywhere but not everywhere. For instance, if f is zero on a dense set of points but positive elsewhere. In such a case, if the function is Riemann integrable, the set where it's non-zero must have measure zero. Wait, no. If a function is zero except on a dense set, but if that dense set has measure zero, then the integral would be zero. But if the set where it's positive has measure greater than zero, then the integral would be positive. But Riemann integrable functions must be continuous almost everywhere. So if f is Riemann integrable and positive on a closed interval except possibly on a set of measure zero, then the integral is positive. However, if f is positive at every point, then the set where it's positive is the entire interval, which has full measure, so the integral must be positive.\n\nTherefore, maybe the confusion comes from the difference between \"positive everywhere\" versus \"positive almost everywhere.\" If a function is positive almost everywhere on [a, b], then its integral is non-negative, and if it's positive on a set of positive measure, the integral is positive. But if the function is zero almost everywhere, even if it's positive at some points (but measure zero), then the integral is zero.\n\nSo, going back to the original question. The user is integrating a strictly positive function on (0, π). If the function is strictly positive on (0, π), but perhaps is zero at the endpoints 0 and π. Then over the closed interval [0, π], the function is non-negative, and strictly positive on (0, π). So the set where it's positive is (0, π), which has measure π > 0. Therefore, if the function is Riemann integrable on [0, π], then the integral should be positive. \n\nBut the user is confused because the book says that even if the function is positive on a closed interval, the integral might not be positive. That must be a case where the function is not Riemann integrable. For example, consider a function that is 1 on a Smith–Volterra–Cantor set (which has positive measure) and 0 elsewhere. This function is discontinuous on the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set, which has positive measure, so it's not Riemann integrable. Hence, the integral isn't defined in the Riemann sense, but maybe in another sense. Or maybe the book is using a different integral where even if the function is positive everywhere, the integral can be zero? That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the example in the book might involve a function that is positive on the closed interval but not bounded away from zero. For example, f(x) = x on (0,1], and f(0) = 1. Wait, that's still bounded away from zero. Hmm. Wait, if a function is continuous on a closed interval and positive, then by compactness, it attains its minimum, which is positive, so the integral is at least the minimum times the length of the interval, hence positive. Therefore, for continuous functions, the integral of a positive function is positive.\n\nBut if the function is not continuous, it might not be bounded away from zero. For example, define f on [0,1] by f(x) = x for x ≠ 0, and f(0) = 1. Then f is positive everywhere on [0,1], but it's not bounded away from zero. The infimum is zero, so the lower integral is zero. Wait, but the upper integral would be the integral of x from 0 to1, which is 1/2. Since the upper and lower integrals differ, the function is not Riemann integrable. So in this case, the function isn't integrable. Hence, maybe the example in the book is of a non-integrable function?\n\nAlternatively, consider a function that is 1 at x=0 and 1/n for x in [1/(n+1), 1/n) for each n. This function is positive everywhere on [0,1], but the integral would be the sum of 1/n * (1/n - 1/(n+1))). But I need to check if this is integrable. The function has countable discontinuities, so it's Riemann integrable. Wait, Riemann integrable functions must be continuous almost everywhere. If the discontinuities are countable, that's measure zero. So this function would be Riemann integrable. Then the integral would be sum_{n=1}^\\infty (1/n)(1/n - 1/(n+1))). Let's compute this:\n\nsum_{n=1}^\\infty (1/n^2 - 1/(n(n+1))) = sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2 - sum_{n=1}^\\infty (1/n - 1/(n+1))).\n\nThe first sum is π²/6, and the second sum telescopes to 1. Therefore, the integral would be π²/6 - 1 ≈ 0.6449..., which is positive. So even though the function is not bounded away from zero, as long as it's positive on a set of positive measure and integrable, the integral is positive.\n\nWait, but if the function is positive everywhere but the infimum is zero, can the integral still be positive? Yes, because even if the infimum is zero, the integral could still be positive. For example, consider f(x) = x on (0,1], f(0) = 1. Wait, but this function is not continuous at 0. But if we make it continuous except at 0, which is a single point, hence measure zero. Then the integral would be the same as integrating x from 0 to1, which is 1/2, which is positive. Wait, but in this case, f is not bounded away from zero, but the integral is still positive.\n\nSo maybe the key point is that if a Riemann integrable function is non-negative on [a, b] and positive on a set of positive measure, then the integral is positive. So if the function is strictly positive everywhere on [a, b], then the set where it's positive is the entire interval, which has measure b - a > 0, hence the integral must be positive. Therefore, the confusion arises when the function is positive on a closed interval but not Riemann integrable. However, if it's Riemann integrable and positive on a closed interval, the integral is positive.\n\nBut the user mentioned that in the proof, the function is strictly positive on (0, π), and the integral over [0, π] is claimed positive. So even if the function is zero at the endpoints, as long as it's positive on (0, π), and Riemann integrable on [0, π], then the integral is positive. However, the user is confused because the book says something different. Perhaps the book's example is a non-Riemann integrable function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the book is discussing functions that are positive but not necessarily Riemann integrable, so the integral (in some other sense) might not be positive. But in the context of the original question, the user is talking about the Riemann integral, so assuming the function is Riemann integrable.\n\nSo to answer the user's question: If f is Riemann integrable on [a, b], and f(x) > 0 for all x in [a, b], then the integral is positive. If f is strictly positive on (a, b) but zero at a and/or b, as long as it's integrable on [a, b], then the integral is still positive because the set where it's positive is (a, b), which has measure b - a. \n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are that the function is Riemann integrable on the closed interval and strictly positive on the open interval (which is a set of full measure). Hence, the integral must be positive. The confusion from the book example might be when the function is not integrable or when considering a different type of integral.\n\nSo structuring the problem as per the user's requested format:\n\nAssumption: The function is Riemann integrable on [0, π].\nAssumption: The function is strictly positive on the interval (0, π).\nProblem: Prove that the integral of the function over [0, π] is positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem in the user's question doesn't specify the integrability, but in the example they mention, the function is continuous. If the function is continuous on [0, π] and positive on (0, π), then since [0, π] is compact, the function attains its minimum, which would be at least zero. But since it's positive on (0, π), the minimum is zero only at the endpoints. Wait, but if the function is continuous at the endpoints and positive in the interior, then actually, the minimum would be zero (at the endpoints). So the function is non-negative on [0, π], but not strictly positive. However, the integral of a non-negative continuous function with zeros only at the endpoints would still be positive, because the function is positive on a set of full measure.\n\nWait, let's take an example: f(0) = 0, f(π) = 0, and f(x) > 0 for x in (0, π). If f is continuous on [0, π], then the integral over [0, π] is positive. Because even though f is zero at the endpoints, it's positive everywhere else. For example, f(x) = sin(x) on [0, π]. The integral is 2, which is positive. So yes, even if the function is zero at the endpoints but positive in between, as long as it's continuous, the integral is positive.\n\nBut if the function is not continuous, like having a dense set of zeros but positive elsewhere, but still Riemann integrable, then the set of zeros must have measure zero, so the integral would still be positive.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- The function is Riemann integrable on [0, π].\n- The function is strictly positive on the open interval (0, π).\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that the integral over [0, π] is positive.\n\nBut the user's original question says \"a strictly positive function in (0, π)\" is integrated over [0, π], and the integral is claimed positive. The user is confused because they found a case where even if a function is positive on a closed interval, the integral might not be positive. But that must be under different conditions, maybe the function isn't integrable or the integral is defined differently.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem with the necessary assumptions:\n\nAssumption: The function is Riemann integrable on [0, π].\nAssumption: The function is strictly positive for all x in (0, π).\nProblem: Prove that the integral of the function over [0, π] is positive.\n\nThis way, the assumptions ensure that the function is integrable and positive on the interval except possibly at the endpoints, but since the endpoints have measure zero, the integral is positive.",
