    "Content": "Without appealing to the axiom of choice, it can be shown that (Proposition:) if $X$ is well-orderable, then $2^X$ is totally -orderable. Question: can we show the stronger result that if $X$ is well-orderable, then so too is $2^X$? Proof of Proposition . Pick any well-ordering of $X$. Then the lexicographic order totally orders $2^X$. More explicitly: for any two $f,g \\in 2^X$, define $f < g$ iff there exists $x \\in X$ such that $f(x) \\neq g(x)$, and if $x \\in X$ is minimal such that $f(x) \\neq g(x)$, then $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=1$. It can be shown that $<$ totally-orders $2^X$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "No. The axiom \"If $X$ can be well-ordered then $2^X$ can be well-ordered\" implies the axiom of choice in $\\sf ZF$. In $\\sf ZFA$ or $\\sf ZF-Reg$ this is no longer true, though. To see more details see the first part of Jech, The Axiom of Choice Chapter 9. One very interesting observation about the fact that in $\\sf ZFA$ this statement does not prove the axiom of choice, is that if $\\psi(X)$ is a statement in which all the quantifiers are either bounded in $y$ or bounded in $\\mathcal P(y)$ (where $y$ is a variable, of course), and in $\\sf ZF$ we have that $\\forall X\\psi(X)$ implies $\\sf AC$, then in $\\sf ZFA$ we have that $\\forall X\\psi(X)$ implies that the power set of a well-ordered set is well-orderable. (This is the first problem in the aforementioned chapter 9.)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about whether, without using the axiom of choice, we can prove that if a set X is well-orderable, then its power set 2^X is also well-orderable. The proposition mentioned states that 2^X is totally orderable under these conditions, but the question is if it's actually well-orderable.\n\nLooking at the example provided, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the key points are that X is well-orderable, and the context is without using the axiom of choice. The problem is to show the stronger result of well-ordering 2^X under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure the assumptions are correctly extracted. The main assumption is that X is well-orderable. The problem is to prove that 2^X is also well-orderable without appealing to the axiom of choice. The proposition mentioned uses a lexicographic order to totally order 2^X, but total order isn't necessarily a well-order. So the question is whether this total order is a well-order or if another approach can achieve a well-order.\n\nWait, but the user's example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nThe example original problem states \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem under assumptions lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut perhaps in that example, maybe there was a typo or misunderstanding. However, for the current problem, I need to focus on the actual question. The user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions here are that X is well-orderable, and the context is without using the axiom of choice. However, the problem is to show that 2^X is well-orderable under that assumption.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Without appealing to choice, can we prove that if X is well-orderable, then so too is 2^X?\" So the main assumption is that X is well-orderable, and the problem is to prove 2^X is well-orderable without AC. So the assumptions should include that X is well-orderable, and the context is working without the axiom of choice. However, the user's example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\" which was part of the original problem's universal quantifier. In this case, the original problem's assumption is \"X is well-orderable\", and the question is about 2^X under that assumption, without using AC.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: X is a well-orderable set.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^X is well-orderable without appealing to the axiom of choice.\n\nBut wait, the example had assumptions split into separate lines. So each assumption is one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the main assumption is that X is well-orderable, and perhaps that we are working in ZF without AC. But the problem states \"without appealing to choice\", which is a condition on the proof, not an assumption about the objects. So maybe the assumptions are only about the objects, not the meta-condition of the proof. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's universal quantifier.\n\nIn this case, the original problem is \"if X is well-orderable, then so too is 2^X\", and the context is \"without appealing to AC\". So the assumption is that X is well-orderable, and the problem is to show 2^X is well-orderable, under the condition that the proof doesn't use AC. But in the user's example, the assumption included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the original problem was \"for every integer n\", which didn't have the divisibility condition. That suggests perhaps the example had a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to include all given conditions as assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement.\n\nSo in this problem, the assumption is that X is well-orderable, and the problem is to prove 2^X is well-orderable without using AC. But the example's format included assumptions that were part of the problem's premise. Therefore, here, the assumption is \"X is well-orderable\", and the problem is to show 2^X is well-orderable (without AC, which is part of the problem statement's condition). However, the user's example included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem, perhaps indicating that the user's example had an error. But regardless, I need to follow the format as per the user's instruction.\n\nSo, for the current problem:\n\nAssumption: X is a set that is well-orderable.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^X is well-orderable without appealing to the axiom of choice.\n\nBut the original problem's title also mentions the proposition that 2^X is totally-orderable, which is given. But the question is about the stronger result of well-orderability. The user's example didn't include the proposition's content in the assumptions. So the only assumption here is that X is well-orderable. The problem is to prove 2^X is well-orderable without AC.\n\nSo I think that's the correct structure.",
