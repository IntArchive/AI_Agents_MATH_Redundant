    "Content": "The well known proof of Cantor's theorem (stating that $A<2^A$ for any set $A$ ) does not make any use of the axiom of choice. I have now spent some time wondering if the analogous result $A^2<3^A$ can be proved by similarly explicit means. It is straightforward enough to produce an injection from $A^2$ into $3^A$ (just send $(a,b)$ to $\\chi_{\\{a\\}}+\\chi_{\\{a,b\\}}$ ). But trying to mimic the proof to show that there can be no surjection gives me trouble and I am wondering if there even is some explicit construction. Note that the strict inequality is a theorem of $\\sf ZF$ alone, but the only proof I know (an adaptation of Lemma 11.10 in Jech's \"The Axiom of Choice\") instead shows that there can be no injection going the other way, using (for instance) the Hartogs Aleph of $A$ . But apart from not giving that much insight into a more explicit method, this does not even rule out the existence of such a surjection. So my question is this: Can you give a proof without $\\sf AC$ that there is no surjection from $A^2$ onto $3^A$ ? Alternatively, are there models of $\\sf ZF$ , where there is such a surjection for some set $A$ (much to my surprise)? Any insights into this are well appreciated",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's consistent relative to ZF that ZF holds and there's a surjection of this kind; the argument of Peng, Shen,  Wu linked to in the comments\ncan be slightly modified to give a model in which there is a set $A$ and a surjection $\\Phi:[A]^2\\to\\mathcal{P}(A)\\times\\mathcal{P}(A)$ , and hence a surjection $\\pi:A^2\\to 3^A$ . For this, following their notation, modify their map $h_n$ so that $$h_n:[\\omega_{n+1}\\backslash\\omega_n]^2\\twoheadrightarrow\\big(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega_n)\\times\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)\\big)^2.$$ (This part is done using choice and enough GCH, so there is no difficulty here.)\nIn adapting Lemma 3.1, the functions $g$ are of course of the form $$g:\\alpha\\to\\big(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega_n)\\times\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)\\big)^2.$$ A partial automorphism of $\\mathcal{A}_n$ is then a map $\\pi:D\\to\\omega_{n+1}$ with domain some $D\\subseteq\\omega_{n+1}$ , satisfying conditions as in the paper,\nexcept that in the second bullet point,\nif $$h_n(\\{\\xi,\\eta\\})=\\big(\\left<B_0,r_0\\right>,\\left<B_1,r_1\\right>\\big)$$ where $B_0,B_1\\subseteq\\omega_n$ and $r_0,r_1\\subseteq\\omega$ ,\nthen $$h_n(\\{\\pi(\\xi),\\pi(\\eta)\\})=\\big(\\left<\\pi``B_0,r_0\\right>,\\left<\\pi``B_1,r_1\\right>\\big).$$ Lemma 3.2 adapts correspondingly,\nand the definition of automorphism of $\\mathcal{A}$ adapts analogously\nto that for $\\mathcal{A}_n$ . Lemma 3.3 is just the same. The model $\\mathcal{V}$ is constructed from $\\mathcal{A}$ as before.\nLemma 3.4 goes through. And finally for Lemma 3.5, define the surjection $$\\Phi:[A]^2\\twoheadrightarrow\\mathcal{P}(A)\\times\\mathcal{P}(A)$$ via the obvious adaptation: set $$\\Phi(\\{\\xi,\\eta\\})=\\left<B_0\\cup\\bigcup_{k\\in r_0}\\omega_{n+k+1}\\backslash\\omega_{n+k},B_1\\cup\\bigcup_{k\\in r_1}\\omega_{n+k+1}\\backslash\\omega_{n+k}\\right>$$ where $h(\\{\\xi,\\eta\\})=\\big(\\left<B_0,r_0\\right>,\\left<B_1,r_1\\right>\\big)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully to extract the key assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original problem is about proving, without using the axiom of choice, that for any set \\( A \\), there's no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\). The user also mentions an injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\) using characteristic functions, but the difficulty lies in showing no surjection exists. They reference ZF set theory and alternative models where such a surjection might exist.\n\nNow, the task is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then state the problem concisely.\n\nAssumptions here would be:\n\n1. The context is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (ZF).\n2. \\( A \\) is any set.\n3. There exists an injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\).\n4. The proof must not use the Axiom of Choice.\n\nThe problem is to prove there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\), or alternatively, find a ZF model where such a surjection exists for some \\( A \\).\n\nWait, the original question mentions both parts: proving no surjection exists without AC, or finding a model where such a surjection does exist. However, in the example provided, the problem was focused on proving divisibility. So maybe the main problem here is the first part, and the alternative is an additional query. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example had assumptions and then the problem. \n\nLooking at the original problem statement again: \"Can you give a proof without AC that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\)? Alternatively, are there models of ZF where there is such a surjection...?\"\n\nBut the example format only includes one problem. So perhaps the primary problem is the first part, and the alternative is another question. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which for the original problem was to state the main problem after the assumptions. \n\nIn the example, assumptions included that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in this case, the assumptions would be about the set theory context (ZF without AC), any set \\( A \\), and the existence of an injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\). The problem is to prove no surjection exists from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user says that the straightforward injection is given (sending (a,b) to χ_{a} + χ_{a,b}), but the challenge is showing no surjection exists. The problem is to prove that there's no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\) without using AC. The alternative question is about models where such a surjection exists, but perhaps that's a separate part. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as the example, which only had the main problem. So maybe the main problem here is the first part.\n\nBut the example included assumptions like \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are:\n\n- Working in ZF (without AC).\n- \\( A \\) is any set.\n- There's an injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user also mentions that the strict inequality \\( A^2 < 3^A \\) is a theorem of ZF alone, but the proof they know uses methods that don't rule out surjection. So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The proof is in ZF set theory (without AC).\n2. \\( A \\) is any set.\n3. An injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\) exists (as constructed explicitly).\n\nBut the problem is to show there's no surjection. Alternatively, the user is asking whether such a proof exists or if there are models with such surjections. But according to the example, the problem should be phrased as the main question. So perhaps the problem is: \"Prove without using the Axiom of Choice that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\), or alternatively, determine if there are models of ZF where such a surjection exists.\"\n\nBut the example's problem was a single statement. Maybe the primary problem is the first part. The alternative is an additional question. The user's original problem says \"Can you give a proof without AC that there is no surjection... Alternatively, are there models of ZF where...\" So maybe the problem is split into two, but the example only has one problem. Hmm.\n\nThe example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So following that structure, the problem here would be \"Prove that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\) without using the Axiom of Choice.\" The alternative part is a separate question but perhaps needs to be included as part of the problem statement. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the example, which has a single problem. So perhaps the main problem is the first part.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The context is ZF set theory (without AC).\n- \\( A \\) is any set.\n- There exists an injection from \\( A^2 \\) to \\( 3^A \\).\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\).\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove that for any set \\( A \\), there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\) without using the Axiom of Choice.\" But the original problem also asks about the existence of models where such a surjection exists, but perhaps that's a secondary question. Since the example only has one problem, I think the main problem is the first part. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Working in ZF set theory (without AC).\n- \\( A \\) is any set.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\).\n\nThe injection part is mentioned in the original question as a given, but maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem context. The key assumptions are that we're in ZF and \\( A \\) is any set. The problem is to show no surjection exists. So I think the formatted problem should list assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof is in ZF set theory (without the Axiom of Choice),\n\\( A \\) is any set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\).\n\nBut the example's assumptions included properties of the object (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the context (ZF without AC) is part of the framework, not an assumption on A. Hmm, maybe the assumption is that the proof must not use AC, and \\( A \\) is any set. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe proof does not use the Axiom of Choice,\n\\( A \\) is any set.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no surjection from \\( A^2 \\) onto \\( 3^A \\).\n\nThis seems closer to the example, where assumptions were about the object (n being integer, divisible by 7). Here, the key points are that we're working without AC and \\( A \\) is any set. The problem is to show no surjection exists. The existence of the injection is part of the problem context but not an assumption. So the formatted version should be as above.",
