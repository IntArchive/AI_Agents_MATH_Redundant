    "Content": "I know that there are three important results when taking the Determinants of Block matrices $$\\begin{align}\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B \\\\\n0 & D \n\\end{bmatrix} &= \\det(A) \\cdot \\det(D) \\ \\ \\ \\ & (1) \\\\ \\\\\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B \\\\\nC & D \n\\end{bmatrix} &\\neq AD - CB & (2) \\\\ \\\\\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B \\\\\nC & D \n\\end{bmatrix} &= \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B \\\\\n0 & D - CA^{-1}B\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{\\det(A)\\cdot \\det\\left(D-CA^{-1}B\\right)}_\\text{if $A^{-1}$ exists} \\\\ \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{\\det\\left(AD-CB\\right)}_\\text{if $AC=CA$} & (3)\n\\end{align}$$ Now I understand in result $(3)$, that all that row operations are being performed to bring it into the form we see in $(1)$, but I can't seem to convince myself that result $(1)$ is true in the first place. Furthermore in result $(3)$, I understand that,  $\\det(A)\\cdot \\det\\left(D-CA^{-1}B\\right) = \\det\\left(A(D-CA^{-1}B)\\right)= \\det(AD-CB)$, via the product rule for determinants I also understand that we need $A^{-1}$ to exist, for the initial row operation to reduce the matrix into an upper triangular form $U$, and I understand that we require $AC = CA$, to allow commutativity when we multiply $ACA^{-1}B$ to reduce it to $CB$. Can someone provide proofs for results $(1)$ and $(2)$, as I can't seem to find proofs for them in any of the textbooks I have at my disposal",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To prove $(1)$ , it suffices to note that $$\n\\pmatrix{A &B\\\\0&D} = \\pmatrix{A & 0\\\\0 & D} \\pmatrix{I&A^{-1}B\\\\0 & I}\n$$ From here, it suffices to note that the second matrix is upper-triangular, and to compute the determinant of the first matrix.  It is easy to see that the determinant of the first matrix should be $\\det(A)\\det(D)$ if we use the Leibniz expansion. Alternatively, the determinant of the first matrix can be further decomposed into $$\n\\det \\left[\\pmatrix{A & 0\\\\0 & I}\\pmatrix{I & 0\\\\0 & D} \\right] = \\det \\pmatrix{A & 0\\\\0 & I} \\det \\pmatrix{I & 0\\\\0 & D}.\n$$ For an example where $(2)$ fails to hold, consider the matrix $$\n\\pmatrix{\n0&1&0&0\\\\\n0&0&1&0\\\\\n0&0&0&1\\\\\n1&0&0&0\n} = \n\\pmatrix{B&B^T\\\\B^T&B}\n$$ For an example where the diagonal blocks are invertible, add $I$ to the whole matrix.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proofs for two results (1) and (2) regarding determinants of block matrices. The user already understands result (3) but is confused about why (1) is true and why (2) is stated as an inequality. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions block matrices, so I should identify the conditions under which results (1) and (2) hold. \n\nFor result (1), the matrix is a block upper triangular matrix with A and D on the diagonal and B and 0. The key assumptions here are the structure of the matrix (blocks A, B, 0, D) and that A and D are square matrices. Also, the determinant is the product of det(A) and det(D). So the assumptions would involve the structure of the matrix and the blocks being square.\n\nFor result (2), the matrix is a general block matrix where the determinant is not equal to AD - CB. The assumption here is that the matrix is partitioned into blocks A, B, C, D, but without any specific conditions like being triangular or commutative. The inequality highlights that the determinant isn't simply the product of the diagonal blocks minus the product of the off-diagonal blocks unless certain conditions hold (like in result 3). So the assumption is that the blocks don't satisfy the conditions required for the determinant to be AD - CB.\n\nProblem (1) asks to prove that the determinant of the block upper triangular matrix is det(A)det(D). Problem (2) asks to show that the determinant is not equal to AD - CB in general. \n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single condition applied to one object. For example, in result (1), the matrix structure is one assumption, the blocks A and D being square is another. For result (2), the matrix structure and the lack of specific conditions (like triangular form or commutativity) are the assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the original question, result (2) is written as det(...) ≠ AD - CB. So the problem here is to show that the determinant of a general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB. So the assumption would be that the block matrix is partitioned into A, B, C, D without any restrictions (like C being zero or A and C commuting). So the assumption is that the blocks are arbitrary (except being compatible sizes) and the problem is to show that det(...) ≠ AD - CB.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions for (1): The matrix is a block upper triangular matrix with blocks A, B, 0, D. A and D are square matrices.\n\nAssumptions for (2): The matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D with no specific conditions (like C being zero or commuting).\n\nBut the user wants each problem to be addressed separately. Wait, in the example given, the user had one problem with assumptions. But here, the original question is asking for proofs for both results (1) and (2). So perhaps each result is a separate problem? But the user's format seems to require each problem to be structured with its own assumptions and problem statement. However, the user provided an example where the original problem was about proving divisibility, and the formatted problem had assumptions and the problem. \n\nIn the current case, the user is asking for proofs of (1) and (2). So maybe treat each result as a separate problem. But the user's example only has one problem. Alternatively, perhaps structure the problem as two separate problems under the same heading. But the user's format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". So perhaps list all assumptions for both results, then state both problems. However, each result has different assumptions.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's query had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem only mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the original problem, the user wants to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem in the example lists the assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But actually, the original problem doesn't require n to be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. So the example might have been a mistake. \n\nBut regardless, the current task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the format. The question is about proofs for results (1) and (2). \n\nResult (1) is about the determinant of a block upper triangular matrix. So assumptions for (1): the matrix is block upper triangular (with 0 in the lower left block), A and D are square matrices. Problem (1): Prove that det of this matrix is det(A)det(D).\n\nResult (2) is that det of a general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB. Assumption: the matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D with no specific conditions. Problem: Show that det ≠ AD - CB.\n\nHowever, the user's example only listed one problem with assumptions. Here, we have two separate results (1) and (2). The original question is asking for proofs of both. So perhaps structure them as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements.\n\nBut the user's format example only shows one problem. So maybe we need to combine them. Alternatively, the problem statement can be split into two parts. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Can someone provide proofs for results (1) and (2), as I can't seem to find proofs for them in any of the textbooks I have at my disposal\"\n\nSo the user wants proofs for both (1) and (2). Therefore, perhaps structure each as a separate problem. But the user's format example has one problem. The user might prefer both in the same problem, but given that they are two different results, they might need separate assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, the assumptions for each result can be listed, and the problem includes proving both (1) and (2). However, each result has different assumptions.\n\nWait, result (1) has specific assumptions (block upper triangular, A and D square), while result (2) is a general case where the determinant is not equal to AD - CB, which is probably under the assumption that there's no structure (so arbitrary blocks). \n\nTherefore, perhaps structure it as two problems:\n\nFirst problem: assumptions for (1), problem: prove (1). Second problem: assumptions for (2), problem: prove (2). But the user's example only has one problem. However, in this case, the original problem is asking for two proofs, so maybe the formatted problem should list both with their respective assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user's example had multiple assumptions for a single problem, here we might have two separate problem entries. But the user's format example shows one problem. Maybe the answer should have two sections. But the user's format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". Therefore, perhaps list all assumptions for both results and then state both problems.\n\nBut that might not be correct. Let me think again. The original problem is asking for proofs of (1) and (2). Each result has different assumptions. So perhaps, structure them as two separate problems. But the user's format example has one problem. So perhaps the answer should present two formatted problems. But the user's instructions say to structure the problem as the given format. So maybe the answer should have two formatted blocks? Or combine them into one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants each result to be a separate problem entry. Since the original question is asking for two proofs, each with different conditions, it's better to split them into two separate formatted problems. However, the user's example doesn't do that. But since the example was a different case, maybe here it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement can be written as two parts under the same problem. But the user's format example lists assumptions line by line. So perhaps list all the assumptions related to each result and then state the problems.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions for result (1): The matrix is a block matrix with A and D as square matrices, and the lower-left block is 0.\n\nProblem (1): Prove that det[...] = det(A)det(D).\n\nAssumptions for result (2): The matrix is a block matrix partitioned into A, B, C, D with no specific conditions (arbitrary blocks).\n\nProblem (2): Show that det[...] ≠ AD - CB.\n\nBut in the user's format, there is only one \"Assumption\" section and one \"Problem\" section. Therefore, maybe list all assumptions for both results, then state both problems. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is a block upper triangular matrix with blocks A, B, 0, D,\nA and D are square matrices,\nThe matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D without any specific conditions.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the determinant of the block upper triangular matrix is det(A)det(D),\nShow that the determinant of the general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nBut this might not be precise, as the assumptions are separate for each problem. Alternatively, perhaps the original question is considered as two separate problems, each requiring their own assumptions. But according to the user's example, even when the problem was to prove divisibility for all integers n, an extra assumption was added (n divisible by 7), which seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is wrong? Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless there's a typo. But that's the user's example.\n\nIn any case, perhaps for the current problem, it's best to structure each result as a separate problem. However, given that the user's format example only has one problem, maybe the answer should be two formatted blocks. But the user might not want that. Alternatively, given that the user's original question is about two results (1) and (2), maybe present both in one formatted problem by listing all assumptions and then the two problems. But that might be conflating them.\n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended that each result is a separate problem, hence two separate formatted entries. However, since the user hasn't specified, and given the example, perhaps structure it as one problem with multiple assumptions and multiple problem statements. But the format requires \"Problem: <the problem>\", singular. So maybe combine them.\n\nAlternatively, the original question is considered as one problem with two parts. So:\n\nAssumptions: \nFor result (1): The matrix is a block upper triangular matrix with blocks A, B, 0, D,\nA and D are square matrices.\nFor result (2): The matrix is a general block matrix partitioned into A, B, C, D.\n\nProblem: \nProve that:\n1. The determinant of the block upper triangular matrix is det(A)det(D).\n2. The determinant of the general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nBut the user's format example lists assumptions line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor the first result, the matrix is block upper triangular with A, B, 0, D,\nA and D are square matrices.\nFor the second result, the matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D with no specific conditions.\n\nProblem:\nProve results (1) and (2) as stated.\n\nHmm, but this is a bit convoluted. Alternatively, maybe split into two separate formatted entries. But since the user's example has one, perhaps follow that. However, in this case, the original question is about two distinct results with different assumptions. Therefore, I think the best approach is to present two separate formatted problems, each addressing one result. But the user's format example doesn't do that, but maybe that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user's example may have been incorrect (adding an assumption not present in the original problem), perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to list the assumptions required for each result and then state the problems.\n\nBut how to fit this into the given format? The user's format has \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\". Each assumption is one line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFor result (1):\n\nAssumptions:\n- The matrix is a block matrix partitioned into four blocks A, B, 0, D.\n- A is a square matrix.\n- D is a square matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that the determinant of the matrix is det(A) * det(D).\n\nFor result (2):\n\nAssumptions:\n- The matrix is a block matrix partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D.\n- No additional conditions are imposed on the blocks (e.g., C is not necessarily zero, A and C do not necessarily commute).\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of the matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nTherefore, in total, two formatted problems. But according to the user's instructions, the answer should follow the format:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: <list>\nProblem: <problem>\n###\n\nSo if we need to present both, maybe combine them into one, but that would mix assumptions. Alternatively, present each result separately. However, the user's example only has one problem. Given that, maybe combine them:\n\nAssumption: \nFor result (1): The matrix is block upper triangular with blocks A, B, 0, D,\nA and D are square matrices.\nFor result (2): The matrix is partitioned into blocks A, B, C, D without specific conditions.\n\nProblem: \nProve that:\n1. For a block upper triangular matrix with A and D square, det(matrix) = det(A)det(D).\n2. For a general block matrix, det(matrix) ≠ AD - CB.\n\nBut this is combining two problems into one, which may not fit the format. The user's example had a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two separate formatted blocks. But the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one format per original problem. Given that, the original question is one problem asking for two proofs. Therefore, list all relevant assumptions and state the problem as proving both results.\n\nBut how to list assumptions for both results in one list? Each assumption line should address one property for one object.\n\nFor result (1):\n- The matrix is block upper triangular (lower-left block is zero).\n- A is a square matrix.\n- D is a square matrix.\n\nFor result (2):\n- The matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D.\n- No conditions are imposed on the blocks (C is non-zero, A and C may not commute).\n\nSo combining:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is block upper triangular with lower-left block zero,\nA is a square matrix,\nD is a square matrix,\nThe matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D,\nNo conditions are imposed on the blocks in the general case.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The determinant of the block upper triangular matrix is det(A)det(D).\n2. The determinant of the general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nBut this is a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps structure the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nFor the block matrix in result (1):\n- The matrix is partitioned into blocks A, B, 0, D,\n- A and D are square matrices.\nFor the block matrix in result (2):\n- The matrix is partitioned into blocks A, B, C, D,\n- No specific conditions are imposed on the blocks.\n\nBut the user's format requires each assumption to be a single line. Therefore, perhaps list them as:\n\nAssumption:\nIn result (1), the matrix is block upper triangular,\nIn result (1), A is a square matrix,\nIn result (1), D is a square matrix,\nIn result (2), the matrix is partitioned into four blocks A, B, C, D,\nIn result (2), no specific conditions are imposed on the blocks.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The determinant of the block upper triangular matrix is equal to det(A) multiplied by det(D).\n2. The determinant of the general block matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a single line, addressing one property for one object (either result (1) or (2)). However, the user's example didn't prefix assumptions with \"In result (1)\", but maybe that's acceptable for clarity. Alternatively, rephrase:\n\nAssumption:\nFor the first matrix, the lower-left block is zero,\nFor the first matrix, A is a square matrix,\nFor the first matrix, D is a square matrix,\nFor the second matrix, the blocks A, B, C, D are arbitrary,\nFor the second matrix, no commutativity conditions hold between blocks.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The determinant of the first matrix is det(A)det(D).\n2. The determinant of the second matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nThis seems better. Each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property for one object (either the first or second matrix). The problem then states both proofs required.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first matrix is block upper triangular with lower-left block zero,\nThe first matrix's block A is square,\nThe first matrix's block D is square,\nThe second matrix is partitioned into four arbitrary blocks A, B, C, D,\nNo commutativity conditions are assumed between blocks of the second matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. The determinant of the first matrix is det(A) · det(D).\n2. The determinant of the second matrix is not equal to AD - CB.\n\nThis way, all assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition, and the problem is stated as two parts. This should fit the user's format.",
