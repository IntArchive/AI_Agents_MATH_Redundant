    "Content": "Define the trace of a matrix with entries in $\\mathbb C$ to be the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity. It is a standard (but I think extremely surprising) fact that this is the sum of the elements along the diagonal. One proof of this is as follows: Define $Tr'(A)$ to be the sum of the entries along the diagonal of $A$. If $A$ is an $n\\times m$ matrix and $B$ and $m\\times n$ matrix, we have\n$$Tr'(AB)=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}b_{ji}=\\sum_{j=1}^m\\sum_{i=1}^n b_{ji}a_{ij}=Tr'(BA)$$\nand thus for any invertible matrix $P$ we have $Tr'(PAP^{-1})=Tr'(P^{-1}PA)=Tr'(A)$, i.e. $Tr'$ is independent of basis. Thus it suffices to note that when $A$ is in Jordan Normal Form, $Tr'(A)$ is the trace of $A$. I find this proof pretty unsatisfying, mainly because I don't see any reason I would expect the sum along the diagonal to be basis-independent. Is there a more illuminating proof of this out there?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let us start with another basis-independent yet more tractable (as it does not require the characteristic polynomial to split) definition of the trace. We will check in the end that it coincides with your definition, and with the sum of the diagonal coefficients with respect to any basis. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $F$. And let $L(V)$ be the algebra of $F$-linear maps from $V$ to $V$. Note that we have a canonical isomorphism $$\nL(V)\\simeq V\\otimes V^*\n$$ via $v\\otimes w^* \\simeq w^*(\\cdot)v$. In other words, $L(V)$ is a natural incarnation of the tensor product of $V$ with its dual $V^*$, with rank-one operators as elementary tensors. Observe that the bilinear map $(v,w^*)\\longmapsto w^*(v)$ factors uniquely through the tensor product. That's the trace, which is therefore characterized by\n  $$\n\\mathrm{tr}:V\\otimes V^*\\longrightarrow F\\qquad \\mathrm{tr}(v\\otimes w^*)=w^*(v).\n$$ Now choose any basis $\\{e_i\\}$ for $V$ and denote its dual basis by $\\{e_i^*\\}$. We have $\\mathrm{tr}(e_i\\otimes e_j^*)=\\delta_{ij}$. Therefore, for every $x=\\sum x_{ij}e_i\\otimes e_j^*\\in L(V)$, we have \n$$\n\\mathrm{tr} (x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ii}.\n$$ Conclusion When given a matrix $x$ in $M_n(F)$, think of it as an operator in $L(F^n)$ via the canonical basis of $F^n$. Its trace is then defined canonically as above. And whatever basis you choose for $F^n$, the sum of the diagonal coefficients will be equal to $\\mathrm{tr}(x)$. In particular, it is also equal to the sum of the eigenvalues counted with multiplicities when the characteristic polynomial of $x$ splits. Note It also helps understand why $\\mathrm{tr} (ab)=\\mathrm{tr}(ba)$, beyond the calculation you mentioned. Indeed\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}((v_1\\otimes w_1^*)(v_2\\otimes w_2^*))=w_1^*(v_2)\\mathrm{tr}(v_1\\otimes w_2^*)=w_1^*(v_2)w_2^*(v_1)\n$$\n$$\n=w_2^*(v_1)w_1^*(v_2)=w_2^*(v_1)\\mathrm{tr}(v_2\\otimes w_1^*)=\\mathrm{tr}((v_2\\otimes w_2^*)(v_1\\otimes w_1^*))\n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user is asking why the trace of a matrix, defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, is equal to the sum of the diagonal entries. They provided a proof using basis invariance and Jordan form, but find it unsatisfying because the connection between diagonal sums and eigenvalues isn't clear.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The original problem defines trace as the sum of eigenvalues. Then, they mention Tr' as the sum of diagonal entries. The proof shows Tr' is invariant under similarity transformations (like change of basis), hence equals trace when in Jordan form. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. Trace is defined as the sum of eigenvalues (with multiplicity).\n2. Tr' is defined as the sum of diagonal entries.\n3. The field is complex numbers (since eigenvalues are considered in C).\n4. The proof uses similarity invariance to equate Tr' and trace in Jordan form.\n\nBut the user is looking for an alternative proof that makes the relationship between diagonal sum and eigenvalues more intuitive. So the problem they want answered is why the sum of the diagonal equals the sum of eigenvalues, possibly without relying on Jordan form or basis invariance.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity.\n- The entries of the matrix are in the complex numbers.\n- Tr'(A) is defined as the sum of the diagonal entries of matrix A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix (sum of eigenvalues) is equal to the sum of its diagonal entries.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user is not asking to prove it again but why it's true, seeking a more illuminating proof. However, the format requires stating the problem as a directive. So perhaps rephrase the problem as: \"Prove that the trace of a matrix, defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, is equal to the sum of the elements along its diagonal.\"\n\nBut the original problem's title is \"Why is the trace of a matrix the sum along its diagonal?\" So the core problem is to show the equivalence between the two definitions: sum of eigenvalues vs sum of diagonal entries.\n\nThe assumptions need to list the conditions given. The user mentions that the trace is defined as the sum of eigenvalues, and Tr' is the sum of diagonal entries. The field is C (as eigenvalues are in C). The matrices considered are square matrices (since trace is defined for square matrices). So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity).\n- Matrices have entries in the complex numbers.\n- For any square matrix A, Tr'(A) is the sum of its diagonal entries.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix equals Tr'(A), i.e., the sum of its eigenvalues equals the sum of its diagonal entries.\n\nBut the user's actual question is asking for a more illuminating proof than the one presented. However, according to the task, we need to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info. The example given had the user's original problem, and the formatted version extracted assumptions and the problem. So here, we need to list all assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem mentions:\n\n- Trace defined as sum of eigenvalues.\n- Tr' is sum of diagonal entries.\n- The proof given uses similarity invariance (Tr'(AB)=Tr'(BA)), hence Tr' is basis-independent, so equals trace in Jordan form.\n\nBut the user finds this unsatisfying. The problem is to find another proof. So the problem to structure is \"Prove that the trace of a matrix (sum of eigenvalues) is equal to the sum of its diagonal entries.\"\n\nBut the assumptions would include the definitions given. Let's check the example again. The example had:\n\nOriginal problem's formatted version listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\" but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" because perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted version changed assumptions to n is an integer, n divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the original problem had \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user's example may have a typo. Hmm. But regardless, for the current problem, we need to extract assumptions from the user's problem statement.\n\nThe user's problem statement:\n\nDefine trace as sum of eigenvalues. Then, they define Tr' as sum of diagonal. The proof uses that Tr' is invariant under similarity transformation, hence same as trace in Jordan form. User wants a more illuminating proof.\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Trace is sum of eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity).\n2. Entries are in C (since eigenvalues are considered in C).\n3. Tr' is sum of diagonal entries.\n4. The problem is in the context of complex matrices (since Jordan form applies over algebraically closed fields).\n\nBut the problem is to show Tr = Tr', given that definitions. However, the user is not stating the problem as \"Prove Tr = Tr'\", but rather questioning why the sum along diagonal equals sum of eigenvalues. So the formatted problem should be to prove that the trace (sum of eigenvalues) equals the sum of the diagonal entries.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity.\n- The entries of the matrix are in the complex numbers.\n- Tr'(A) is defined as the sum of the diagonal entries of matrix A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix equals Tr'(A), i.e., the sum of its eigenvalues equals the sum of its diagonal entries.\n\nWait, but the user mentions that the proof given uses invariance under similarity transforms. So maybe another assumption is that Tr' is similarity-invariant, but the user's question is to find another proof. However, the assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem, not the steps of the proof. So perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions of trace and Tr', and that the field is C.\n\nYes, so:\n\nAssumption:\n- The trace of a matrix with entries in $\\mathbb{C}$ is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity.\n- For any square matrix $A$, $Tr'(A)$ is defined as the sum of the elements along its diagonal.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix equals $Tr'(A)$, i.e., the sum of its eigenvalues equals the sum of its diagonal entries.",
