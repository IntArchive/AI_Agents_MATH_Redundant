    "Content": "Prove that any two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence are relatively prime. My attempt: We have $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2, \\dots$, so obviously $\\gcd(f_1, f_2) = 1$. Suppose that $\\gcd(f_n, f_{n+1}) = 1$; we will show that $\\gcd(f_{n+1}, f_{n+2}) = 1$.\nConsider $\\gcd(f_{n+1}, f_{n+2}) = \\gcd(f_{n+1}, f_{n+1} + f_n)$\nbecause $f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n.$ Then $\\gcd(f_{n+1}, f_{n+1} + f_n) = \\gcd(f_{n+1}, f_{n}) = 1$ (gcd property). Hence, $\\gcd(f_n, f_{n+1}) = 1$ for all $n > 0$. Am I on the right track? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is stated clearly.\n\nThe original problem is about proving that any two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence are relatively prime. The user's attempt uses induction, starting with the base case of gcd(f1, f2) = 1, then assuming gcd(fn, fn+1) = 1 and showing it for the next step. They use the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a + b) which simplifies to gcd(fn+1, fn) = 1 due to the induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, applying the required format. The problem is to prove that consecutive Fibonacci numbers are coprime. The assumptions would include the definition of Fibonacci sequence: f1 = 1, f2 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous. However, looking at the example given, the assumptions were about the variable (n being an integer and divisible by 7). But in this problem, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included the conditions on n. Here, the problem's assumptions might be the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. However, since the problem is general, maybe the assumptions are the definition of Fibonacci numbers. Let me check the example again. The original problem in the example had A(n) defined with 5^n and 6^n terms, and the assumption was n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, they only kept the assumption that n is an integer and added that it's divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But perhaps in their example, the actual problem required n divisible by 7? Hmm, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem actually requires n to be an integer without any divisibility conditions, but the answer might involve showing divisibility by 7 and 13. But the user formatted it as assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems wrong. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, I need to follow their format as per the example. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user's original question is about consecutive Fibonacci numbers being coprime. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by f1=1, f2=1, and f_{n+2}=f_{n+1}+f_n. The user's attempt uses induction. So for the assumptions, we need to list each assumption. The problem is to prove that any two consecutive terms are relatively prime. The definition of the Fibonacci sequence is part of the problem setup. The assumptions might be the properties used in the proof. Wait, but according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions. For instance, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. But maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that the user needs to apply. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user filtered out unrelated information. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake or was more complex, and the formatted problem corrects it. But maybe in the example, the original problem actually had n divisible by 7 as a condition? The original problem is stated as: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But 91=13*7. To be divisible by 91, the expression must be divisible by both 7 and 13. If n is any integer, then maybe the expression is divisible by 7 and 13 for all n. But perhaps in the example, the user mistakenly added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. But that might not be necessary. So maybe the example is incorrect. However, regardless of that, I need to follow the user's example structure. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as follows. The problem is to prove that consecutive Fibonacci numbers are coprime. The assumptions would be the properties of the Fibonacci sequence. Let's look at the original question: \"Prove that any two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence are relatively prime.\" The Fibonacci sequence is defined as f1=1, f2=1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1, and f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n for n ≥ 1.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is one property applied to one object. So the definition of the Fibonacci sequence is part of the problem setup, so maybe the assumption is the recursive definition. Alternatively, since the problem is about consecutive terms, maybe the assumption is that the Fibonacci sequence is defined with f1=1, f2=1, and each term after is the sum of the previous two. But each part should be a separate line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_1 = 1,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_2 = 1,\nFor all n ≥ 1, f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n.\n\nBut in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each part of the definition would be separate lines.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove that any two consecutive terms are relatively prime. The user's attempt uses induction, starting with the base case gcd(f1, f2)=1, then assuming gcd(fn, fn+1)=1 and showing gcd(fn+1, fn+2)=1. Using the property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, a + b). So in the problem statement, the key assumptions are the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. The problem is to prove the consecutive terms are coprime. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBut maybe the problem itself doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the definition. The original problem doesn't state any conditions; it's a general statement about all consecutive terms. So the assumptions would be the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, each part of the definition as separate lines.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_1 = 1,\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by f_2 = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence are relatively prime.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not require listing the Fibonacci definition as assumptions, but since the example included assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), here the Fibonacci sequence's definition is part of the problem's assumptions. Hence, each line for each part.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf_1 = 1,\nf_2 = 1,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that any two consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence are relatively prime.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each part of the Fibonacci definition is a separate assumption line. The problem is to prove they're coprime. The user's attempt uses induction, but the problem itself doesn't require induction as part of the assumptions. The key is to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions.",
