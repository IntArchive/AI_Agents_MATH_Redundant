    "AcceptedAnswer": "I've just been able to prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions. First, note that it is sufficient to prove the following $(\\star)$ : $(\\star)\\ \\ $ Any natural number $N$ can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions. (If we get $(\\star)$, then all we need is to divide $N$ by an odd which is the very denominator.) Now, let $p_i$ be the $i$-th odd prime number arranged in ascending order. ($p_1=3, p_2=5, p_3=7, \\cdots$) Here, we use the following two famous facts : $(1) \\ \\ p_{i+1}\\lt 2p_i$ (by Chebyshev) $(2) \\ \\frac1{p_1}+\\frac1{p_2}+\\cdots$ diverges. (by Euler) By $(2)$, we can take $n\\ge 5$ such that \n$$\\frac1{p_1}+\\frac1{p_2}+\\cdots+\\frac1{p_n}\\gt N+1.$$\nLet's fix one of such $n$. Then, letting $P=p_1p_2\\cdots p_n$, we know that $P\\gt 3$ and that \n$$\\left(1+\\frac1{p_1}\\right)\\cdots\\left(1+\\frac1{p_n}\\right)\\gt 1+\\left(\\frac1{p_1}+\\cdots+\\frac1{p_n}\\right)\\gt 1+(N+1)\\gt N+1+\\frac 3P.$$ Now, let $q_j$ be the $j$-th positive divisor of $P$ arranged in ascending order: ($q_1, q_2,\\cdots,q_m$ where $m=2^n$)\n$$q_1=1, q_2=3,q_3=5,q_4=7, q_5=11, q_6=13, q_7=15, \\cdots, q_n=P.$$ Lemma 1 : $q_{i+1}\\lt 2q_i$ when $i=2,\\cdots,m-2$. (Note that this lacks $i=1,m-1$ because $\\frac{q_2}{q_1}=\\frac{q_m}{q_{m-1}}=3\\gt 2$.) Lemma 2 : Each of $3,4,\\cdots, q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_i$ can be represented as the sum of some different elements in $q_1,q_2,\\cdots,q_i$ when $i=3,\\cdots,m-1$. (For example, when $i=3$, we get $3=q_2, 4=q_1+q_2, 5=q_3, 6=q_1+q_3$. When $i=4$, we get $7=q_4, 8=q_1+q_4,9=q_1+q_2+q_3, 10=q_2+q_4, 11=q_1+q_2+q_4, 12=q_3+q_4, 13=q_1+q_3+q_4.)$ (I'll prove these lemmas at the last.)\n Let's prove that $(\\star)$ follows these lemmas. To do this, let $R=q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_{m-1}$.( Note that this lacks both of $q_2=3$ and $q_m=P$) Then, we get\n$$R=(q_1+q_2+\\cdots+q_m)-(3+P)=(p_1+1)\\cdots(p_n+1)-(3+P).$$ \nHence, since we get\n$$\\frac RP=\\frac{(p_1+1)\\cdots (p_n+1)}{P}-\\left(\\frac 3P+1\\right)=\\left(1+\\frac1{p_1}\\right)\\cdots\\left(1+\\frac1{p_n}\\right)-\\left(\\frac 3P+1\\right)\\gt\\left(N+1+\\frac 3P\\right)-\\left(\\frac 3P+1\\right)=N,$$\nwe know that $3\\le NP\\lt R$. By lemma 2, we can represent $NP$ as\n$$NP=q_{a_1}+q_{a_2}+\\cdots+q_{a_k} \\ \\ (1\\le a_1\\lt aa_2\\lt \\cdots\\lt a_k\\le m-1).$$\nHence, we get\n$$N=\\frac{q_{a_1}}{P}+\\cdots+\\frac{q_{a_k}}{P}.$$\nHere, since each of $q_{a_i}$ is a positive divisor of $P$, each of $\\frac{q_{a_i}}{P}$ is an odd unit fraction. Now the proof for $(\\star)$ is completed. In the following, we are going to prove the above lemmas. Proof for lemma 1 : Let $_kr_i$ be the $i$-th number in ascending order which can be represented the product of $k\\ (k=0,\\cdots,n)$ different elements in $p_1,\\cdots,p_n$. For example, $$_kr_1=p_1p_2\\cdots p_k,\\  _kr_{\\binom{n}{k}}=p_np_{n+1}\\cdots p_{n-k+1},\\  _0r_1=1, \\ _nr_1=P.$$\nThen, by the fact $(1)$, we know that we can get $_kr_{j+1}\\lt 2 _kr_j$. Now, let's prove that $q_{i+1}\\lt 2q_i$ for $i=2,\\cdots, m-2$. Note that $q_i=_kr_j$ for some $k,j$ where $1\\le k\\le n-1$. First, if $j\\lt \\binom nk$, then we know that \n$$q_{i+1}\\le _kr_{j+1}\\lt 2_kr_j=2q_i.$$\nNext, if $j=\\binom nk$, then we get\n$$q_i=p_n\\times p_{n-1}\\times \\cdots\\times p_{n-k+1}$$\nwhere $i\\le m-2$ leads $k\\le n-2$ and $n-k+1\\ge 3$. In the $n=5$ case, by $p_n=p_5=13$ and $p_1\\times p_2=3\\times 5=15$, we know \n$$q_{i+1}\\le p_1\\times p_2\\times p_{n-k+1}\\times p_{n-k+2}\\times\\cdots\\times p_{n-1}=\\frac{15}{13}p_{n-k+1}\\times p_{n-k+2}\\cdots\\times p_{n-1}\\times p_n=\\frac{15}{13}q_i\\lt 2q_i.$$\nIn the $n\\ge 6$ cases, by $p_n\\ge p_6=17\\gt 15=p_1\\times p_2$, we get \n$$_{k+1}r_1\\lt _kr_{\\binom nk}\\lt _{k+1}r_{\\binom{n}{k+1}}.$$\nHence, since we can tak $l$ such that \n$$_{k+1}r_{l}\\lt _kr_{\\binom nk}\\lt _{k+1}r_{l+1},$$\nwe know that \n$$q_{i+1}\\le _{k+1}r_{l+1}\\lt 2 _{k+1}r_{l}\\lt 2q_i$$\nfor $q_i= _kr_{\\binom nk}.$ Now the proof for lemma 1 is completed. Proof for lemma 2 : The $i=3$ case is obvious. We treat $l\\ge 4$ in the following. First, by induction on $i$, we are going to prove \n$$(\\star\\star)\\ \\ 3+q_{i+1}\\le q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_i+1$$\nwhen $4\\le i\\le m-2$. In $i=4$ case, we get\n$$LHS=3+q_5=3+11=14, RHS=q_1+q_3+q_4+1=1+5+7+1=14.$$\nNow, supposing that $(\\star\\star)$ is true when $i=k\\ (4\\le k\\le m-3)$, in $i=k+1$ case, by lemma 1 and inductive supposition, $LHS=3+q_{k+2}\\lt 3+2q_{k+1}=(3+q_{k+1})+q_{k+1}\\lt (q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_k+1)+q_{k+1}=RHS.$\nHence, the proof for $(\\star\\star)$ is completed. Now, let's prove lemma 2 by induction on $i$. The $i=4$ case has been already proved, so let's suppose that lemma 2 is true when $i=k\\ (4\\le k\\le m-2)$. We know that the numbers from $3+q_{k+1}$ to $q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_{k+1}$ can be represented as the sum of some different elements in $q_1,q_2, \\cdots, q_{k+1}.$ By the way, by $(\\star\\star)$, since\n$$3+q_{k+1}\\le q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_k+1,$$\nas a result we know that the numbers from $3$ to $q_1+q_3+q_4+\\cdots+q_{k+1}$ can be represented as the sum of some different elements in $q_1,q_2,\\cdots,q_{k+1}$. So lemma 2 is true when $i=k+1$. Hence we know that lemma 2 is true for $4\\le i\\le m-1$. Now the proof for lemma 2 is completed.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if any odd fraction can be represented as a finite sum of distinct odd unit fractions. First, let me parse the definitions they provided. An \"odd fraction\" is one where the denominator is odd. An \"odd unit fraction\" has a numerator of 1 and an odd denominator. The question is whether every such odd fraction can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd unit fractions.\n\nLooking at the examples they gave, like 2/5 being 1/3 + 1/15, it seems like they're looking for representations similar to Egyptian fractions but restricted to denominators that are odd. The motivation mentions Egyptian Fractions, so maybe there's a connection here. But Egyptian fractions allow denominators to be any positive integer, as long as they're distinct. Here, the restriction is that all denominators must be odd, and the original fraction also has an odd denominator.\n\nI need to structure this problem according to the specified format. The original problem mentions that any odd fraction (with an odd denominator) can be represented as a finite sum of different odd unit fractions. So the assumptions would include the definitions provided. Let me check the example given by the user. In their example, the assumption includes that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nFor this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The fraction in question has an odd denominator (since it's called an odd fraction).\n2. The sum must consist of finite terms.\n3. Each term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (so denominator is odd, numerator is 1).\n4. All the unit fractions in the sum must be different (no duplicates).\n\nSo, translating these into the assumption lines:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd),\nThe sum must be finite,\nEach term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator is odd, numerator is 1),\nAll terms in the sum are distinct.\n\nProblem: Is it true that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions?\n\nWait, the original question says \"any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\" So the problem is asking for a proof or counterexample of that statement. The assumptions would then include the definitions given. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem's question is: \"Is the following true? 'Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.'\"\n\nSo the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement. The original fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd), and the sum requires that each term is an odd unit fraction (so denominator is odd, numerator 1), and they are distinct. Also, the sum must be finite.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumption included the specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more general. Let me list the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. The fraction has an odd denominator (since it's an odd fraction).\n2. The sum is finite.\n3. Each term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator is odd, numerator is 1).\n4. All terms in the sum are distinct.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is whether any such fraction can be represented under these conditions. Therefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd),\nThe sum must be finite,\nEach term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator is odd and numerator is 1),\nAll terms in the sum are distinct.\n\nProblem: Is it true that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions?\n\nWait, the problem is a yes/no question. But in the example given by the user, the problem was a statement to prove. So maybe in this case, since the original question is phrased as \"Is the following true?\", the problem line should be the statement to verify. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem under \"Problem:\" was \"Prove that...\", which matches. Here, the original question is asking if a certain statement is true. So the problem line should restate that statement as the assertion to verify. Therefore:\n\nProblem: Is the statement \"Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions\" true?\n\nBut the user's example converted the original question into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". Here, the original problem is a question asking if a statement is true. But according to the user's instruction, the problem line should be the problem to solve. Since the user's example includes the problem as the statement to prove, perhaps here we need to structure it similarly, i.e., present the statement as the problem to be proven or disproven. Therefore, the problem line would be:\n\nProblem: Determine whether any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is phrased as a yes/no question, maybe we need to rephrase it as a statement. But the user's example shows that the problem line is the assertion to prove, even if the original question was a request to prove. So perhaps in this case, the problem line should be the assertion given in the question, which is \"Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\"\n\nThus, following the example, the formatted problem should present the assertion as the problem to prove or disprove, with the assumptions listed as per the problem's conditions. The user's example included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the fraction being an odd fraction, the sum being finite, terms being odd unit fractions, and distinctness.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd),\nThe sum is finite,\nEach term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator is odd, numerator is 1),\nAll terms in the sum are different.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem line starts with \"Prove that...\". The original question here is phrased as \"Is the following true?\" which is a yes/no question, but according to the user's example, they converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. However, in the original example, the problem was to prove something. Here, since the user is asking whether the statement is true, perhaps the problem line should be \"Determine whether any odd fraction...\", but the example's structure had \"Problem: Prove that...\". To adhere to the user's example format, perhaps it's better to present it as the assertion to prove, even if the original question is phrased as a question. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the given example. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem's problem line: \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo they rephrased the original problem's question as a \"Prove that\" statement, even though the original was already a \"Prove that\". In the current case, the original problem is a question asking if the statement is true. So perhaps the problem line should be the statement in question. The user's example did not include \"prove or disprove\" but just \"Prove that...\", but perhaps in cases where the problem is a conjecture, the problem line should present the conjecture. So here, since the original problem is asking if the statement is true, the problem line should be the assertion: \"Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\" Therefore, the problem line would be: \"Prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\" However, the user hasn't specified whether they want the problem line to include \"Prove that\" or to present it as a question. The example shows \"Prove that...\", so perhaps following that, even if the original is a question, the problem line is the assertion to prove.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem line should mirror the original question's intent. The original question is asking for proof or counterexample, so perhaps the problem line should be \"Is the following true? 'Any odd fraction...'\", but the user's example structured the problem line as the assertion to prove. Therefore, to follow the example, the problem line here should be the assertion. Thus:\n\nProblem: Prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\n\nBut the original question is whether this is true, not a direct request to prove it. However, given the example, the user structured the problem as the assertion to prove. Hence, perhaps the correct approach here is to present the problem line as the statement to be proven, even if the original question is phrased as a question. This is because the user's example took an original problem that was a \"Prove that...\" and made it the problem line. Therefore, in this case, the problem line would be the statement from the original question: \"Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\"\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example format, where the problem line starts with \"Prove that...\", perhaps the problem line here should start similarly. However, since the original problem is phrased as a question, maybe we should present it as a question. But the example didn't. Let me check the user's instruction again.\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format. You will be given some example which I structured before.\"\n\nThe example's formatted problem has:\n\nAssumption: ... (list of assumptions)\nProblem: Prove that ...\n\nTherefore, even if the original problem is a question, the formatted problem line is a statement to prove. Hence, in this case, the problem line should be the assertion given in the original question. The original question's main assertion is \"Any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\" Therefore, the problem line would be: \"Prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\"\n\nBut since the original problem is phrased as a question asking whether it's true, perhaps the problem line should be \"Determine whether any odd fraction...\", but the example's problem line is a direct \"Prove that...\". Given that the user provided the example, we should follow their style. Therefore, the answer should be structured with the problem line as \"Prove that...\", even though the original is a question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem line should just restate the assertion without \"Prove that\", but the example includes \"Prove that\". So perhaps the correct format is to use \"Prove that\".\n\nBut the original problem is not a direct request to prove but to verify if the statement is true. However, the example shows that even if the original problem is a request to prove, the formatted problem line is \"Prove that...\". Therefore, in this case, even though the original question is phrased as a yes/no question, the formatted problem line should present the assertion as a statement to prove, because that's what the user's example did. Thus:\n\nProblem: Prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\n\nBut the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" However, the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) - 6^n(3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. But perhaps in that example, the user made an error. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem required n divisible by 7, but the user's example added that. But that seems conflicting. However, since the user provided that example as their structure, we have to follow their format. Therefore, in that example, the original problem's conditions were filtered, and the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem line to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nBut in the original example problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that maybe the original problem had a mistake, or the user modified it. But regardless, we have to follow the user's example structure.\n\nTherefore, in our current problem, we need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- The fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd).\n\nThe problem is asking if such a fraction can be expressed as a sum of distinct odd unit fractions, which implies:\n\n- The sum must be finite.\n\n- Each term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator odd, numerator 1).\n\n- All terms are distinct.\n\nTherefore, each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fraction is an odd fraction (denominator is odd),\nThe sum must be finite,\nEach term in the sum is an odd unit fraction (denominator is odd and numerator is 1),\nAll terms in the sum are distinct.\n\nProblem: Prove that any odd fraction can be represented as the finite sum of different odd unit fractions.\n\nHowever, the original problem's examples include fractions like 2/5, 3/5, etc., which have even numerators but odd denominators. So the key is that the denominator is odd, regardless of the numerator. The assumptions must capture that the fraction in question has an odd denominator, and the terms in the sum are distinct odd unit fractions.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be as above.",
