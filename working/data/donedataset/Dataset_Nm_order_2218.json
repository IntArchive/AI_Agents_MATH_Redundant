    "Content": "I am trying to find an elementary proof that if $\\phi$ is a linear map from $\\mathbb{Z}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^m$ represented by an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$, then the map is surjective iff the gcd of the determinants of all the $m\\times m$ minors of $A$ is $1$. I know that for there to be surjectivity between $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $\\mathbb{Z}^m$ $n$ must be greater than or equal to $ m$ and for there to even be $m \\times m$ minors $n$ again must be greater than or equal to $ m$, so I just assume this throughout. I sort of have one direction $\\Leftarrow$ i) Greatest Common Divisor =1 implies surjectivity: First observe that the if $ | \\mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M)| < \\infty$ then $|\\det M| = | \\mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M) |$ otherwise $\\det(M) = 0$ where $M$ is an $m\\times m$ matrix. We can consider the $n$ columns of $A$ as column vectors $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$. These $n$ column vectors live in $\\mathbb{Z}^m$. Let $S'' = \\{ v_i\\}$ and then let $S'$ be subsets of $S''$ of cardinality $m$ and lastly let $S$ be the elements of $S'$ such that when the $m$ $v_i$ vectors are considered as $m\\times m$ matrices, the determinant is not zero, thus $S$ consists of all $m\\times m$ minors of $A$ with non-zero determinant (we ignore zeroes since they do not affect gcd). For each $s\\in S$ define a map $i_s: \\mathbb{Z}^m \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^n$ that maps the standard basis of \n$\\mathbb{Z}^m$ to the basis elements $e_k \\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $v_k \\in s$. That is, $\\phi \\circ i_s$ gives the matrix created by the column vectors of \n$s$. Let $\\Lambda$ be the lattice Im$\\phi \\supset \\sum_{s\\in S}$ Im\n$\\phi\\circ i_s =\\sum_{s \\in S} \\Lambda_s$. Thus $\\forall s \\in S$, \n$\\Lambda_s \\subset \\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^m$. Thinking in terms of group theory, we have that $\\Lambda$ is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^m$ and all the \n$\\Lambda_s$ are subgroups of $\\Lambda$. Thus by Lagrange's Theorem, we have \n$|\\mathbb{Z}/\\Lambda| \\Big\\vert |\\mathbb{Z}^m/\\Lambda_s|$ Since $|\\mathbb{Z}^m/\\Lambda_s|$ are the determininants of the $m\\times m$ minors and the definition of the common divisor of several integers is the greatest positive integer dividing all of them. Thus by hypothesis $|\\mathbb{Z}/\\Lambda| \\leq 1$ and so $|\\mathbb{Z}/\\Lambda| =1$ and we have that Im$A=\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^m$ so the map is surjective. I was hoping to get a more elementary proof that doesn't rely on the observation that the if $ | \\mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M)| < \\infty$ then $|\\det M| = | \\mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M) |$ otherwise $\\det(M) = 0$ where $M$ is an $m\\times m$ matrix or normal forms.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and $f : R^n \\to R^m$ be a homomorphism of $R$-modules with corresponding $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ over $R$. Let $Y_1,\\dotsc,Y_v$ be the $m \\times m$ submatrices of $A$. Then $f$ is surjective iff the $\\mathrm{det}(Y_1),\\dotsc,\\mathrm{det}(Y_v)$ generate the unit ideal of $R$. Proof (which I learned from Darij Grinberg): Assume that $f$ is surjective. Then there is some $n \\times m$ matrix $B$ with $AB=1_m$. Let $Z_1,\\dotsc,Z_v$ denote the $m \\times m$ submatrices of $B$. Then the Cauchy-Binet formula (which has a nice graph theoretic proof) implies $1=\\mathrm{det}(AB)=\\sum_{s=1}^{v} \\mathrm{det}(Z_s) \\mathrm{det}(Y_s)$. Conversely, assume $\\sum_s \\lambda_s \\mathrm{det}(Y_s)=1$ for some $\\lambda_s \\in R$. Let $B_s$ denote the $n \\times m$ matrix, which is built up out of $\\mathrm{adj}(Y_s)$ and with zero columns which were deleted in $A \\mapsto Y_s$. Let $B = \\sum_{s=1}^{v} \\lambda_s B_s$. Then we have $$AB = \\sum_s \\lambda_s A B_s = \\sum_s \\lambda_s Y_s \\mathrm{adj}(Y_s) = \\sum_s \\lambda_s \\mathrm{det}(Y_s) 1 = 1.$$ Remark: One can show that $f$ is injective iff $(\\mathrm{det}(Y_1),\\dotsc,\\mathrm{det}(Y_s))$ is a regular ideal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants an elementary proof that a linear map represented by an m×n matrix A over the integers is surjective if and only if the gcd of the determinants of all its m×m minors is 1. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and filter out the extraneous information. The user mentions they have one direction (⇐) using some group theory concepts like Lagrange's Theorem and the structure of the image as a lattice. However, they are looking for a more elementary proof that doesn't rely on the observation about the determinant relating to the index of the image in ℤ^m or normal forms.\n\nSo the task is to structure the problem into the specified format. Let me recall the example given. The assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. The problem statement should be concise.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n- The map φ is linear from ℤ^n to ℤ^m, represented by an m×n matrix A.\n- The problem is to prove surjectivity if and only if the gcd of the determinants of all m×m minors is 1.\n- The user assumes n ≥ m because otherwise, there wouldn't be m×m minors. They also mention that for surjectivity, n must be ≥ m, which is correct because a surjective linear map between free ℤ-modules (like ℤ^n to ℤ^m) requires that the rank is at least m, but since we're over ℤ, the structure is a bit different. Wait, actually, over ℤ, surjective implies that the image spans ℤ^m as a ℤ-module, which requires that the matrix has full row rank (in the sense that the minors generate the unit ideal). But the key assumptions here are that n ≥ m and the matrix has m×m minors.\n\nSo the assumptions should include that A is an m×n matrix with integer entries (since it's a map from ℤ^n to ℤ^m), n is greater than or equal to m, and the problem is about surjectivity being equivalent to the gcd of the determinants of all m×m minors being 1.\n\nWait, the user in their question says \"I know that for there to be surjectivity between ℤ^n and ℤ^m, n must be greater than or equal to m\", so that's an assumption they're making, but actually, in the problem statement, the surjectivity is part of the \"if and only if\". However, for the minors to exist, n must be ≥ m. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- φ is a linear map from ℤ^n to ℤ^m represented by an m×n matrix A.\n- n ≥ m (since otherwise, there are no m×m minors).\n- The problem is to prove that φ is surjective if and only if the gcd of the determinants of all m×m minors of A is 1.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single property. Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- φ is a linear map from ℤ^n to ℤ^m.\n- φ is represented by an m×n matrix A.\n- n is greater than or equal to m.\n\nThen the problem is the equivalence between surjectivity and the gcd of minors' determinants being 1.\n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nφ is a linear map from ℤ^n to ℤ^m,\nA is an m×n matrix representing φ,\nn is greater than or equal to m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that φ is surjective if and only if the greatest common divisor of the determinants of all m×m minors of A is 1.\n\nThat should be the formatted problem. Let me check if I missed any assumptions. The problem statement in the original question is about surjectivity of the linear map, which is a ℤ-module homomorphism. The key conditions are that the matrix is m×n with n ≥ m, and the gcd of the m×m minors is 1. The user mentions they assume n ≥ m throughout, so that's an assumption. The other assumptions are that A is the matrix of φ and φ is a linear map between those modules. So yes, that should cover it.",
