    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $0 < p < q$ , where $p,\\, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , the decimal expansion for $p/q$ is eventually periodic. Indeed, the first $k$ digits after the decimal point are given by $\\lfloor 10^kp/q\\rfloor$ . Write $m \\Delta n$ if $10^m$ and $10^n$ have the same remainder when we divide by $q$ ; the pigeonhole principle implies $$m \\Delta n, \\text{ for some }1 \\le m < n \\le q + 1.$$ If $m \\Delta n$ , then \\begin{align} q\\,|\\,(10^mp - 10^np)\n&\\implies q\\,|\\,(10(10^mp - 10^np))\\\\\n&\\implies q\\,|\\,(10^{m+1}p - 10^{n+1}p)\\implies (m+1)\\Delta(n+1),\\end{align} and by induction, $(m+k)\\Delta(n+k)$ for all $k$ , Or in other form $a \\Delta b$ if $b-a=n-m$ which $m \\le a$ and $n \\le b$ $(\\text{equivalent to }0 \\le k)$ . Next, note that if $m \\Delta n$ , and $r$ is the remainder when $10^mp$ and $10^np$ are divided by $q$ , then $\\lfloor10r/q\\rfloor$ is the $(m+1)$ st digit of the decimal expansion of $p/q$ , and the $(n+1)$ st. Thus $a \\Delta b$ similarly results that the $(a+1)$ th digit and the $(b+1)$ th digit of the expansion of $p/q$ are equal, and because it occurs for any $a$ and $b$ that $b-a=n-m$ which $m \\le a$ and $n \\le b$ , Thus $p/q$ has eventually periodic expansion with period $n-m$ . Now, the given decimal does not have period $P$ for any $P$ because for arbitrarily large $N$ , there is a $1$ in the $N$ th decimal place followed by $P$ zeros. More generally, if the decimal expansion of any $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ has arbitrarily long strings of zeros, and repeats with period $K$ , then for any $N$ , there exists $K$ consecutive zeros after the $N$ th spot, so that the $K$ repeating digits are zeros.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about proving that the number 0.101001000100001000001... is irrational and then generalize it. Let me start by understanding the original problem and the example format given.\n\nFirst, the example shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, they had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is restated.\n\nNow, looking at the current problem. The user wants to show that the decimal 0.101001000100001... is irrational. Then they ask for a generalization to similar decimal expansions with 0s and 1s and long gaps of zeros that guarantee irrationality.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The number in question is a decimal expansion with 0s and 1s where the 1s are separated by increasingly long gaps of zeros. So the structure is a 1 followed by one 0, then a 1, then two 0s, then a 1, then three 0s, etc. This pattern continues indefinitely, which means the number is non-repeating and non-terminating.\n\nAssumptions here might be:\n\n1. The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n2. The positions of the 1s are determined by a strictly increasing sequence of gap lengths between them.\n3. The gaps between consecutive 1s increase without bound (i.e., the number of zeros between 1s becomes arbitrarily large).\n\nWait, the original number has gaps that increase by one each time: after the first 1, one zero; after the second 1, two zeros; then three, etc. So maybe the gaps form a sequence where the nth gap is of length n. But the generalization would be any decimal expansion with 0s and 1s where the gaps between 1s are \"long\" in some sense, perhaps increasing and not eventually periodic.\n\nBut how to phrase the assumptions. The problem is to show irrationality for this specific number and then generalize. So for the specific problem, the assumptions are about the decimal expansion's structure. Then the problem is to prove it's irrational. For the generalization, the criterion would involve similar properties.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are properties or conditions applied to one object. So in the example, the object was n, and the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn the current problem, the object is the decimal expansion. So the assumptions would be the properties of that decimal expansion. Let's see:\n\nThe decimal expansion is 0.101001000100001..., which can be described as:\n\n- The decimal expansion has digits 0 and 1.\n- The positions of the digit 1 correspond to the triangular numbers plus one? Wait, the first 1 is at the first decimal place, then the second 1 is after one zero (position 3), then after two zeros (position 6), then after three zeros (position 10), etc. Wait, 1, 3, 6, 10,... which are triangular numbers: 1, 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, etc. So the nth 1 is at position T_n = n(n+1)/2 + 1? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me count:\n\nFirst 1: position 1.\n\nThen after 1 zero: position 2 is 0, position 3 is 1.\n\nThen after two zeros: positions 4 and 5 are 0, position 6 is 1.\n\nThen after three zeros: positions 7,8,9 are 0, position 10 is 1.\n\nSo the positions of the 1s are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc., which are the triangular numbers: T_n = n(n+1)/2 + 1? Wait, actually T_1=1, T_2=3, T_3=6, T_4=10, so the nth 1 is at position T_n = n(n+1)/2 + 1? Wait no, T_1=1, which is (1*2)/2=1. T_2=3, which is (2*3)/2=3. T_3=6=(3*4)/2=6. So the nth 1 is at position T_n = n(n+1)/2. Wait, but position 1 is T_1=1, position 3 is T_2=3, position 6 is T_3=6, etc. So the nth 1 is at the nth triangular number position.\n\nSo the decimal expansion has 1s at the triangular number positions and 0s elsewhere. But the problem statement describes it as \"0.101001000100001000001...\", which indeed has 1s separated by 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., zeros. So the gaps between 1s are increasing by one each time. So the first gap (after the first 1) is 1 zero, then 2 zeros, then 3 zeros, etc.\n\nSo the key assumptions here for the specific number are:\n\n- The decimal expansion is composed of 0s and 1s.\n- The 1s are placed at positions such that the number of zeros between consecutive 1s increases without bound (specifically, each gap is one more than the previous).\n\nBut to fit the example format, each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n- The positions of the 1s are separated by gaps of zeros of lengths 1, 2, 3, ..., respectively.\n- The sequence of gap lengths between consecutive 1s is strictly increasing and unbounded.\n\nBut maybe more precisely:\n\n- The decimal expansion is 0.101001000100001000001..., where each 1 is followed by k zeros before the next 1, with k starting at 1 and increasing by 1 each time.\n\nBut how to phrase each assumption as one line, one property. Let's see:\n\nFirst assumption: The decimal expansion contains only digits 0 and 1.\n\nSecond assumption: Each 1 in the decimal expansion is followed by a number of zeros equal to the position index of the 1. Wait, not exactly. The first 1 is followed by 1 zero, then the next 1 is followed by 2 zeros, etc. So the gaps between 1s are 1, 2, 3, ..., which is an increasing sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the number of zeros between consecutive 1s forms a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nThird assumption: The gaps between consecutive 1s (number of zeros) increase without bound.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the gaps are not eventually periodic, and they increase without bound, which would prevent the decimal from being periodic or eventually periodic, hence irrational.\n\nSo, for the specific problem:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s increases without bound.\n\nAssumption: The sequence of zeros between 1s is not periodic.\n\nWait, but does the problem mention periodicity? The original problem says \"long gaps of zeros\", which might imply that the gaps are sufficiently long to prevent periodicity. However, in the specific example, the gaps are increasing (1,2,3,...), which certainly are non-periodic and unbounded.\n\nSo perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The decimal expansion is composed of 0s and 1s.\n\n2. The positions of 1s are separated by an increasing number of zeros.\n\n3. The number of zeros between consecutive 1s increases without bound (i.e., tends to infinity).\n\nThen the problem is to show that such a decimal expansion is irrational.\n\nBut the user also wants to generalize to a criterion for similar decimal expansions with 0s and 1s and long gaps of zeros guaranteeing irrationality.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and the problem. For the generalization part, the problem would be to find a criterion (i.e., conditions) on the decimal expansions with 0s and 1s and gaps of zeros that ensure irrationality.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The user in the example had added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: Original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is an integer is given. But the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a wrong example? Because the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7 as a condition. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake there. Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the problem requires that n is such that the expression is divisible by both 7 and 13. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which might not need n to be divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps that example is incorrect. But regardless, the current task is to follow the format.\n\nSo in the current problem, the original question is about the specific decimal 0.1010010001... being irrational and then generalizing. So the specific problem's assumptions would be about the decimal's structure, and the problem is to show irrationality.\n\nSo for the specific case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The decimal expansion is composed exclusively of 0s and 1s.\n\n- The positions of the 1s are separated by gaps of zeros that increase by 1 each time (i.e., the first gap is 1 zero, the next is 2 zeros, then 3 zeros, etc.).\n\n- The sequence of gaps between 1s is strictly increasing and unbounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decimal expansion 0.101001000100001... is irrational.\n\nThen, for the generalization, the problem is to find a criterion (conditions) on decimal expansions with 0s and 1s involving long gaps of zeros that guarantee irrationality.\n\nBut how to structure the generalization part. Since the original problem includes both the specific case and the generalization request, perhaps the formatted problem should capture both.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as the format given, which for the example only included the specific problem. The example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem included two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem. But in reality, the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7 as an assumption, so that might have been a mistake. However, following the user's example, perhaps the idea is to list all the conditions from the problem, even if some are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the decimal expansion is given as 0.1010010001..., so the structure is clear. The assumptions are inherent in the description of the decimal. So to list them:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The decimal expansion is composed of 0s and 1s.\n\n- The nth occurrence of 1 is followed by n zeros.\n\nWait, no. In the given decimal, after each 1, the number of zeros increases by 1 each time. The first 1 is followed by 1 zero, then the next 1 is followed by 2 zeros, etc. So the gap after the kth 1 is k zeros. But the positions of the 1s are 1, 3, 6, 10, etc., which are triangular numbers. But perhaps the key is that the gaps between 1s (number of zeros between them) form a strictly increasing sequence that tends to infinity.\n\nSo for the assumptions:\n\n1. The decimal expansion contains only digits 0 and 1.\n\n2. The number of zeros between consecutive 1s forms a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n3. The number of zeros between consecutive 1s tends to infinity (i.e., the gaps are unbounded).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that such a decimal expansion is irrational.\n\nAnd then to generalize, the problem is to provide a criterion (conditions) on decimal expansions with 0s and 1s with long gaps of zeros that ensure irrationality.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the object (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the object is the decimal expansion, so the assumptions are about its structure.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s increases without bound.\n\nProblem: Show that 0.101001000100001000001... is irrational. Generalize this to provide a criterion for decimal expansions with 0s and 1s involving long gaps of zeros that guarantees irrationality.\n\nWait, but the original question asks two things: to show the specific number is irrational and to generalize. So in the formatted problem, should both be included? The example only had the specific problem. Maybe the problem part can include both as stated.\n\nAlternatively, the generalization can be part of the problem statement. So the problem is: Show that 0.1010010001... is irrational and generalize to provide a criterion for similar decimal expansions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated concisely. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that the decimal expansion $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. Provide a criterion for decimal expansions with $0$'s and $1$'s involving long gaps of zeros that guarantees irrationality.\n\nAnd the assumptions would be the properties of the specific decimal. But the user's example had assumptions specific to the problem. So perhaps:\n\nFor the specific problem:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s forms the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., respectively.\n\nProblem: Prove that $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational.\n\nThen, for the generalization:\n\nAssumption: A decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s is unbounded.\n\nProblem: Generalize to provide a criterion for such decimal expansions to be irrational.\n\nBut the original problem combines both into one question. However, the example given by the user only formatted the specific problem, not the generalization. Since the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes Assumption and Problem sections, we need to capture both parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written as:\n\nProblem: Show that $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. How can this be generalized to decimal expansions with 0s and 1s and long gaps of zeros to guarantee irrationality?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be stated as a single problem. However, the example had only one problem. Since the original question has two parts, maybe they should both be included in the problem statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s in the decimal expansion increases without bound.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decimal expansion $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. Generalize this result to provide a criterion for irrationality of decimal expansions with 0s and 1s involving long gaps of zeros.\n\nBut the first assumption is redundant if we already name the decimal expansion. Wait, the example listed assumptions about n. So maybe here, the assumptions are about the decimal expansion's properties. So:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ contains only digits 0 and 1.\n\nAssumption: In the decimal expansion, the number of zeros between consecutive 1s forms a strictly increasing sequence (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s tends to infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. Provide a general criterion for decimal expansions with 0s and 1s and long gaps of zeros that guarantees irrationality.\n\nBut maybe the third assumption is redundant because if the gaps form a strictly increasing sequence, they necessarily tend to infinity. So perhaps it's sufficient to say:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion consists of 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The number of zeros between consecutive 1s forms a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nProblem: Prove that $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. Generalize this to a criterion for decimal expansions with 0s and 1s involving long gaps of zeros that ensure irrationality.\n\nBut in the specific case, the sequence is 1,2,3,..., which is strictly increasing and unbounded. For the generalization, the criterion would likely require that the gaps are not eventually periodic and grow without bound, but the exact conditions need to be specified.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem into assumptions and problem. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion contains only 0s and 1s.\n\nAssumption: The positions of 1s are separated by gaps of zeros that strictly increase in length.\n\nAssumption: The lengths of the gaps between consecutive 1s are unbounded.\n\nProblem: Prove that $0.101001000100001000001\\ldots$ is irrational. State a general criterion for such decimal expansions to be irrational based on their gap lengths.\n\nThis captures the specific problem and the request for generalization. The key assumptions are about the decimal's composition and the nature of the gaps.",
