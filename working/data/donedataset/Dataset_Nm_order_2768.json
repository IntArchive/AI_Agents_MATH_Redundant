    "Content": "Is there a simple, elementary proof of the fact that:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{6n+1}+\\frac{-1}{6n+2}+\\frac{-2}{6n+3}+\\frac{-1}{6n+4}+\\frac{1}{6n+5}+\\frac{2}{6n+6}\\right)=0$$\nI have thought of a very simple notation for \"harmonic\" sums like these: just write down the numerators. So, for example: $[\\overline{1}]=\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\dots=\\infty\\;$ is the harmonic series $[\\overline{1,-1}]=\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{-1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\dots=\\ln2\\;$ is well known $[\\overline{1,1,-2}]=\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{-2}{3}+\\dots=\\ln3\\;$ is slightly less well known (I think) $[\\overline{1,0,-1,0}]=\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{0}{2}+\\frac{-1}{3}+\\dots=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\;$ is the Gregory-Leibniz series for $\\pi$ What I claim is that $[\\overline{1,-1,-2,-1,1,2}]$ is equal to $0$. I wonder if there are any simple proofs of this (i.e. definitely without using calculus, preferably without appealing to complex numbers/taylor series/etc.) P.S. I know a method that doesn't use any integrals or derivatives, but requires knowledge of the taylor series for $\\ln(x)$ and the Euler formula for $e^{ix}$. The reason I believe that there should be an elementary proof is that the sum, $0$, is a very simple number.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We may rewrite your series in the following manner: \\begin{align}\n&\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{6n+1}+\\frac{-1}{6n+2}+\\frac{-2}{6n+3}+\\frac{-1}{6n+4}+\\frac{1}{6n+5}+\\frac{2}{6n+6}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{6n+1}+\\frac{-1}{6n+2}+\\frac{1}{6n+3}+\\frac{-1}{6n+4}+\\frac{1}{6n+5}+\\frac{-1}{6n+6}\\right)\\\\\n&\\hspace{1cm}-\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{3}{6n+3}-\\frac{3}{6n+6}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\nBut these summations are both the alternating series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$. Therefore they cancel and the summation is equal to zero.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants the assumptions and the problem statement structured in a specific format. First, I need to parse the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The title is \"A certain 'harmonic' sum,\" and the question is asking if there's a simple, elementary proof that the given infinite series sums to zero. \n\nThe series in question is:\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{6n+1}+\\frac{-1}{6n+2}+\\frac{-2}{6n+3}+\\frac{-1}{6n+4}+\\frac{1}{6n+5}+\\frac{2}{6n+6}\\right)=0$$\n\nThe user mentions some examples of similar harmonic-like sums with different numerator patterns and their results, like the harmonic series, ln(2), ln(3), and π/4. They also mention a specific notation where the numerators are listed, so the given series is represented as [1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2] repeating every 6 terms. The problem is to prove this sum equals zero using elementary methods, preferably without calculus, complex numbers, or Taylor series.\n\nNow, structuring this according to the required format. The assumptions need to list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement should be the core question. Let me break down the assumptions first.\n\nLooking at the series, each term in the sum is over n starting from 0 to infinity. Each term has denominators of the form 6n + k, where k ranges from 1 to 6. The numerators for each k are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively. So, the coefficients repeat every 6 terms. The series is an infinite sum with this periodic pattern of coefficients.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n- The summation is from n = 0 to infinity.\n- Each term in the summation consists of six fractions with denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, ..., 6n+6.\n- The numerators for these denominators are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively.\n- The problem requires a proof that the sum equals zero.\n- The proof should be elementary, avoiding calculus, complex numbers, or Taylor series if possible.\n\nBut according to the example provided, assumptions are supposed to list conditions on the objects involved. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the objects involved are the terms of the series. Each numerator is fixed per denominator pattern. The key conditions here are the structure of the series: the periodicity of the coefficients and the denominators. \n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n- The summation index n starts at 0 and goes to infinity.\n- For each term in the summation, the denominators are 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6.\n- The numerators corresponding to denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6 are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively.\n- The problem requires proving the sum equals zero.\n- The proof should be elementary (if that's considered an assumption, but maybe the user wants the problem statement to include the requirement for an elementary proof? Wait, in the example, the assumption included conditions on the problem's variables, not the proof method. The original example's problem statement didn't mention the method, but the user mentioned in the question that they want an elementary proof. So perhaps in the formatted problem, we include the requirement for an elementary proof as part of the problem statement, not as an assumption.\n\nLooking back at the example, the assumptions were about the variables and their properties. The problem statement included the divisibility condition. Here, the problem is about the sum's structure and the coefficients. So the assumptions would be about the structure of the sum. \n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n- The summation is over n starting from 0 to infinity.\n- Each term in the summation has denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6.\n- The numerators for denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6 are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively.\n\nThe problem is to prove that this sum equals zero, with the preference for an elementary proof. However, in the example, the problem statement included the divisibility condition, which was part of the assumptions. So maybe the user wants the problem statement to include the requirement for an elementary proof. But in the example, the problem statement didn't mention the method, just the mathematical problem. The original user's question mentions \"definitely without using calculus, preferably without appealing to complex numbers/taylor series/etc.\" So perhaps that's a condition of the problem, but maybe that's part of the problem's constraints rather than an assumption. \n\nIn the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions are the mathematical conditions of the problem. The requirement for an elementary proof is part of the problem's request, not an assumption. So the formatted problem would include the problem statement as \"Prove that [sum] equals 0\" with the assumptions being the structure of the sum. The request for an elementary proof is part of the problem's instruction but perhaps not part of the structured problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91,\" and the formatted assumption listed n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but then the problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So they took the original problem, which had a general n, and in the formatted version, added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have n divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to modify the problem. Wait, perhaps the example was a hypothetical, showing how to structure. Maybe in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem to illustrate the structure. Wait, perhaps the example is not from a real problem but constructed. Anyway, the key is that assumptions are the conditions on the problem's variables, and the problem is the core question.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question's assumptions are the structure of the series: the numerators and denominators, the starting index, and the sum to infinity. The problem is to prove it equals zero. The requirement for an elementary proof is part of the problem's request, not an assumption. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would list the structure of the series, and the problem is to prove the sum is zero. However, in the example, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect, or maybe the user intended to filter out conditions. Wait, looking at the original example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps in the example, the user intended to restructure the problem with additional assumptions. But this seems incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Wait, perhaps the original problem was modified. For example, if the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but in the example, the user presented it as for every integer n, but then formatted it with n divisible by 7. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the example is illustrative but not accurate. Therefore, when applying the format, I should focus on the actual problem presented and list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the sum is from n=0 to infinity, each term is a sum of six fractions with specific numerators and denominators. The problem is to prove the sum is zero. There are no additional hidden conditions; the user is asking if there's a simple proof. So the assumptions should list the structure of the series:\n\nAssumption:\n- The summation is over n from 0 to infinity.\n- Each term in the summation consists of the fractions 1/(6n+1), -1/(6n+2), -2/(6n+3), -1/(6n+4), 1/(6n+5), 2/(6n+6).\n- The numerators for denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6 are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum equals zero.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So each numerator and denominator pair could be individual assumptions. Alternatively, the structure could be broken down into each component.\n\nAlternatively, the periodic nature of the coefficients: the numerators repeat every 6 terms. So the coefficients are periodic with period 6: [1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2]. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each integer n ≥ 0, the sum includes terms with denominators 6n + k for k = 1 to 6.\n- The numerators corresponding to denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6 are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 respectively.\n- The summation is from n = 0 to infinity.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum equals zero.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as separate lines, each addressing one condition. So for the current problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation index n starts at 0 and extends to infinity.\nFor each n, the term consists of six fractions: 1/(6n+1), -1/(6n+2), -2/(6n+3), -1/(6n+4), 1/(6n+5), 2/(6n+6).\nThe numerators of the fractions are 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, 2 for denominators 6n+1 to 6n+6 respectively.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum equals zero.\n\nBut to match the example's structure, where each assumption is a single line per property. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe summation is over n from 0 to infinity.\nEach term in the summation includes denominators 6n+1, 6n+2, 6n+3, 6n+4, 6n+5, 6n+6.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+1 is 1.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+2 is -1.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+3 is -2.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+4 is -1.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+5 is 1.\nThe numerator for denominator 6n+6 is 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{1}{6n+1}+\\frac{-1}{6n+2}+\\frac{-2}{6n+3}+\\frac{-1}{6n+4}+\\frac{1}{6n+5}+\\frac{2}{6n+6}\\right)=0$$.\n\nBut the user's original question also mentions the requirement for an elementary proof, but according to the example, such a requirement is part of the problem statement. So perhaps in the problem line, we include \"using an elementary method (without calculus, complex numbers, or Taylor series)\" or similar. However, in the example, the problem statement didn't include the method, only the mathematical claim. So to follow the example strictly, the problem is just to prove the sum equals zero. The requirement for an elementary proof is part of the original question's context but not part of the structured problem. So the formatted problem would be just the sum equals zero. Therefore, the final answer should structure it as such.",
