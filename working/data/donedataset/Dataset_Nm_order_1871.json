    "AcceptedAnswer": "Fix $n$ and define $f(x)$ by $$ f(x) = (1 - e^{-x})^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k e^{-kx}. $$ Then the left-hand side is equal to $$ \\frac{2}{(n+2)!} f^{(n+2)}(0). $$ So it suffices to find the Taylor polynomial of degree $n+2$ for $f(x)$ at $x = 0$. This can be done as follows: \\begin{align*}\nf(x)\n&= x^n \\left( \\frac{1 - e^{-x}}{x} \\right)^n \\\\\n&= x^n \\exp\\left[ n \\log\\left( \\frac{1 - e^{-x}}{x} \\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= x^n \\exp\\left( -\\frac{n}{2} x + \\frac{n}{24} x^2 + \\cdots \\right) \\\\\n&= x^n \\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{2} x + \\frac{(3n+1)n}{24} x^2 + \\cdots \\right) \\\\\n&= x^n - \\frac{n}{2} x^{n+1} + \\frac{(3n+1)n}{24} x^{n+2} + \\cdots.\n\\end{align*} Therefore we have $$ \\frac{2}{(n+2)!} f^{(n+2)}(0) = \\frac{2}{(n+2)!} \\cdot \\frac{(3n+1)n}{24} (n+2)! = \\frac{(3n+1)n}{12}. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list each assumption line by line, with each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the user is trying to prove an equality between two expressions. The left-hand side is a sum involving binomial coefficients, alternating signs, and powers, all scaled by a factorial term. The right-hand side is a quadratic expression in n.\n\nFirst, I need to identify any assumptions. The problem statement itself doesn't explicitly mention any conditions on n, like it being an integer or positive. However, since the problem involves factorials and binomial coefficients, which are typically defined for non-negative integers, I can infer that n is a non-negative integer. The summation runs from k=0 to n, which makes sense only if n is a non-negative integer. Also, the factorial (n+2)! in the denominator would require n+2 to be a non-negative integer, so n must be a non-negative integer. There might be more implicit assumptions, but these are the main ones.\n\nThe problem is to prove the given equation. The original question mentions that this equality arose from calculating an integral using two different methods, but the integral part isn't directly part of the problem to prove. So the problem is purely about proving the summation equals the fraction.\n\nNow, to structure this properly:\n\nAssumptions should list that n is a non-negative integer. Each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\dfrac{2}{(n+2)!}\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\\binom{n}{k}(n-k)^{n+2}=\\dfrac{n(3n+1)}{12}$$\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, there's no such condition given, but we have to infer based on the mathematical operations involved. So the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer because binomial coefficients and factorials require that. Also, the sum from k=0 to n implies n must be at least 0. So that's the key assumption here.\n\nI don't see any other assumptions in the problem. The integral part is just context but isn't part of the problem to prove. The user is asking specifically about the equality between the sum and the expression on the right. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the assumption about n and then the problem statement as given.",
