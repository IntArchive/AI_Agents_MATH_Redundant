    "Content": "Let $F$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic, $a\\in F$, and $p$ a prime number. Show that $$f(X)=X^p-a$$ is irreducible in $F[X]$ if it has no root in $F$. This answer to a related question mentions the result is due to Capelli. I can prove the result if $F$ has characteristic $p$ as follows.  Suppose $f$ is reducible:\n$f(X)=g(X)h(X)$ with $g(X)$ an irreducible factor of degree $m$, $1\\le m<p$.\nThen if $\\alpha$ is a root of $g$ in some extension field $K$ of $F$, we have\n$$f(X)=X^p-\\alpha^p=(X-\\alpha)^p$$\nso its divisor $g(X)$ must be of the form $(X-\\alpha)^m$. Since the coefficient of $X^{m-1}$ in $g$ is in $F$, we have $m\\alpha\\in F$.  So $\\alpha\\in F$ because $m$ is invertible modulo $p$. How would you show the result in other characteristics?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "A proof of this result can be found on page 297 of Lang's Algebra and goes as follows. Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $q \\neq p$. If $f(x)$ has no root in $F$, then it must be the case that $a$ is not a $p$ - th power in $F$. Suppose that $f(x)$ is reducible. By passing the larger extension $K = F(\\alpha)$ , we see that $\\alpha$ must have degree $d$ where $d < p$. Then $\\alpha^p  = a$ and by applying $N_{K/F}(-)$ gives that $N_{K/F}(\\alpha)^p = a^d$ by multiplicativity of the field norm. Since $(d,p) = 1$ this means that $a$ is a power of $p$ in $F$, a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving the irreducibility of the polynomial \\( f(X) = X^p - a \\) over a field \\( F \\) of arbitrary characteristic, given that it has no root in \\( F \\). The user mentions Capelli's result and provides a partial proof for characteristic \\( p \\). The task is to format this problem according to the example given.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, for this problem, the key elements are:\n\n1. \\( F \\) is a field.\n2. The characteristic of \\( F \\) is arbitrary (could be any characteristic, not specified).\n3. \\( a \\) is an element of \\( F \\).\n4. \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n5. The polynomial \\( f(X) = X^p - a \\) has no root in \\( F \\).\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The problem statement then asks to show that \\( f(X) \\) is irreducible in \\( F[X] \\) under these conditions.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are extracted correctly without including extra information from the user's attempt or the mention of Capelli, as the example excludes such details. The problem statement should be concise, focusing on what needs to be proven based on the assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list each assumption clearly and then present the problem. Let me check if I missed any assumptions. The field's characteristic is arbitrary, which is already stated. The polynomial has no root in \\( F \\), which is crucial. The elements \\( a \\in F \\), prime \\( p \\), and the structure of the polynomial are all essential.\n\nYes, that should cover it. Now, structure it accordingly.",
