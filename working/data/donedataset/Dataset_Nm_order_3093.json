    "Content": "Could you show me how to prove the following formula?$$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\zeta (2n)}{2n(2n+1)2^{2n}}=\\frac12\\left(\\log \\pi-1\\right).$$ In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved the following expression: $$\\zeta (3)=\\frac{2}{7}\\pi^2\\log 2+\\frac{16}{7}\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}x\\log \\left(\\sin x\\right)dx.$$ Note that $$\\zeta (s)=\\frac{1}{1^s}+\\frac{1}{2^s}+\\frac{1}{3^s}+\\cdots=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n^s}.$$\nHowever, as far as I know, no one has been able to calculate this definite integral.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem. The user wants to prove that the infinite series sum of ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}) from n=1 to infinity equals 1/2 (log π - 1). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of the Riemann zeta function, ζ(s) = sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^s. Here, they're specifically looking at ζ(2n), which are even positive integers. The series involves ζ(2n) divided by 2n(2n+1)2^{2n}. \n\nThe user mentioned an integral involving x log(sin x) and another series that relates to ζ(2n). They also provided a product formula for sin(πx) which might be useful. Maybe the approach involves expanding log(sin x) using the product formula, then integrating term by term? \n\nAnother thought: Since ζ(2n) appears, perhaps generating functions or series expansions related to the zeta function could be useful. Also, the presence of 2^{2n} suggests some kind of substitution or scaling. \n\nThe given integral expression connects the integral of x log(sin x) to a series involving ζ(2n). Maybe integrating term by term after expanding log(sin x) using the product formula. Then, comparing coefficients or expressions to derive the desired series. \n\nAlternatively, known series expansions for log(sin x) could be used. For example, the Fourier series expansion of log(sin x) is known, which might lead to integrating term by term. \n\nWait, the user provided another expression: the integral equals (π²/8)(log(π/2) - 1/2 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n})). Maybe manipulating this equation to solve for the sum. If we can relate the sum given in the problem to this sum, perhaps through algebraic manipulation or partial fractions. \n\nThe problem's sum has ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}), while the known sum in the integral has ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n}). Notice that 2n(2n+1) is 2n multiplied by (2n+1), while the denominator in the known sum is n(n+1). Maybe there's a way to express 1/(2n(2n+1)) in terms of 1/(n(n+1)), perhaps by substitution or partial fractions. \n\nAlternatively, consider splitting the denominator: 1/(2n(2n+1)) = [1/(2n)] - [1/(2n+1)]. Wait, let's check: 1/(2n(2n+1)) = A/(2n) + B/(2n+1). Solving, A(2n+1) + B(2n) = 1. Let n = 0: A(1) = 1 => A=1. Let n = -1/2: B(-1) = 1 => B = -1. So, 1/(2n(2n+1)) = 1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1). Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) [1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1)] / 2^{2n}.\n\nThen, the sum splits into two parts: sum ζ(2n)/(2n 2^{2n}) minus sum ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ). Maybe each of these sums can be related to known series or integrals. \n\nAlternatively, using generating functions for ζ(2n). Recall that there's a generating function involving the digamma function or logarithmic terms. For example, from the product formula for sine, taking logs, and expanding. \n\nThe user mentioned the product formula sin(πx) = πx prod_{n=1}^∞ (1 - x²/n²). Taking logarithms, log(sin(πx)/πx) = sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 - x²/n²). Then, expanding each log as a power series: log(1 - x²/n²) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ (x²)^k/(k n^{2k}). So, log(sin(πx)/πx) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ (x^{2k}/k) sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^{2k} ) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ (x^{2k}/k) ζ(2k). \n\nTherefore, log(sin(πx)/(πx)) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) x^{2k}/k. Then, integrating term by term or differentiating might lead to expressions involving ζ(2n). \n\nBut the problem involves a sum with ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}). Let me see. If I set x = 1/2, for example, then x^{2n} = 1/2^{2n}. Maybe plugging x = 1/2 into some integrated version of the log sine product formula. \n\nAlternatively, integrating the expression for log(sin(πx)) over x, multiplied by some polynomial. The user's integral involves x log(sin x). Perhaps similar steps here. \n\nLooking back at the integral expression provided by the user: ∫₀^{π/2} x log(sin x) dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) - 1/2 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n})). If we can relate this sum to the desired sum in the problem, which has denominator 2n(2n+1)2^{2n}. \n\nNote that 2n(2n+1) = 2n*(2n+1) = 2n*(2n+1) = 2n*2n + 2n*1 = 4n² + 2n. Not sure. Alternatively, the sum in the problem is sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}) which can be written as (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n}). Comparing to the known sum in the integral which is sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n}), there's a difference in the denominator: (n+1) vs (2n+1). Maybe substituting variables or shifting indices?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express 1/(2n(2n+1)) as an integral. For example, 1/(2n(2n+1)) = ∫₀^1 t^{2n} (1 - t) dt. Because ∫₀¹ t^{2n}(1 - t) dt = [ t^{2n+1}/(2n+1) - t^{2n+2}/(2n+2) ] from 0 to 1 = 1/(2n+1) - 1/(2n+2) = 1/( (2n+1)(2n+2) ). Hmm, not exactly 1/(2n(2n+1)). Maybe another integral representation. \n\nAlternatively, 1/(2n(2n+1)) = ∫₀¹ t^{2n -1} (1 - t) dt. Let's check: ∫₀¹ t^{2n -1} (1 - t) dt = ∫₀¹ t^{2n -1} dt - ∫₀¹ t^{2n} dt = 1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1) ) = (2n+1 - 2n)/(2n(2n+1)) = 1/(2n(2n+1)). Perfect! So, 1/(2n(2n+1)) = ∫₀¹ t^{2n -1} (1 - t) dt. \n\nTherefore, the sum becomes sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2^{2n}) ∫₀¹ t^{2n -1} (1 - t) dt. If we can interchange the sum and integral, then the sum becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - t) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) (t/2)^{2n -1} dt. \n\nBut ζ(2n) = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^{2n}, so substituting that in: sum_{n=1}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ (t/2)^{2n -1} /k^{2n} (1 - t). Then swapping the sums and integral: ∫₀¹ (1 - t) sum_{k=1}^∞ sum_{n=1}^∞ (t/(2k))^{2n -1} dt. \n\nThe inner sum over n is sum_{n=1}^∞ [ (t/(2k))^{2} ]^{n - 1/2} = (t/(2k))^{-1} sum_{n=1}^∞ (t/(2k))^{2n} = (2k/t) * [ (t^2)/(4k²) ) / (1 - t²/(4k²)) ) ] = (2k/t) * ( t²/(4k² - t²) ). Simplifying, that's (2k/t)(t²/(4k² - t²)) = (2k t)/(4k² - t²). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation there. Let's redo the inner sum. \n\nsum_{n=1}^∞ (t/(2k))^{2n -1} = (t/(2k))^{-1} sum_{n=1}^∞ (t/(2k))^{2n} = (2k/t) sum_{n=1}^∞ (t²/(4k²))^n = (2k/t) * [ (t²/(4k²)) / (1 - t²/(4k²)) ) ] = (2k/t) * ( t²/(4k² - t²) ) = (2k t)/(4k² - t²). \n\nSo then, the sum becomes ∫₀¹ (1 - t) sum_{k=1}^∞ (2k t)/(4k² - t²) dt. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, since we have an expression for log(sin πx) in terms of ζ(2n), perhaps integrating x log(sin πx) over x from 0 to 1/2 or something like that. Let's try.\n\nLet’s consider the integral ∫₀^{1/2} x log(sin πx) dx. Using the product formula, log(sin πx) = log(πx) + sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 - x²/n²). Then, integrating x log(sin πx) = x log πx + x sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 - x²/n²). \n\nIntegrate term by term. The first term is ∫₀^{1/2} x log πx dx. Let’s compute that. Let u = log πx, dv = x dx. Then du = (1/x) dx, v = x²/2. Integration by parts: uv|₀^{1/2} - ∫ v du = ( (x²/2) log πx )|₀^{1/2} - ∫ x²/2 * (1/x) dx = [( (1/8) log(π/2 )) - 0 ] - (1/2) ∫ x dx from 0 to 1/2. The second integral is (1/2)(x²/2)|₀^{1/2} = (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16. So the first term is (1/8) log(π/2) - 1/16.\n\nThe second part is ∫₀^{1/2} x sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 - x²/n²) dx. Interchange sum and integral: sum_{n=1}^∞ ∫₀^{1/2} x log(1 - x²/n²) dx. Let’s change variable: let t = x², dt = 2x dx. Then, ∫ x log(1 - x²/n²) dx = (1/2) ∫ log(1 - t/n²) dt from t=0 to t=1/4. \n\nIntegrate log(1 - t/n²): integral of log(1 - t/n²) dt = - (n² + t) log(1 - t/n²) - t + C. Wait, integration by parts: let u = log(1 - t/n²), dv = dt. Then du = (-1/(n² - t)) dt, v = t. So, uv - ∫ v du = t log(1 - t/n²) + ∫ t / (n² - t) dt. The remaining integral: ∫ t/(n² - t) dt = - ∫ (n² - t - n²)/(n² - t) dt = - ∫ 1 dt + n² ∫ 1/(n² - t) dt = -t - n² log|n² - t| + C. \n\nPutting it all together: t log(1 - t/n²) - t - n² log(n² - t) + C. Evaluated from 0 to 1/4. \n\nAt upper limit 1/4: (1/4) log(1 - 1/(4n²)) - 1/4 - n² log(n² - 1/4). \n\nAt lower limit 0: 0 - 0 - n² log(n²). \n\nThus, the definite integral is [ (1/4) log(1 - 1/(4n²)) - 1/4 - n² log(n² - 1/4) ] - [ -n² log(n²) ].\n\nSimplify: (1/4) log( (4n² -1)/(4n²) ) - 1/4 - n² log( (n² - 1/4)/n² ). \n\nWhich is (1/4)[ log(4n² -1) - log(4n²) ] -1/4 - n² log( (4n² -1)/(4n²) ). \n\nSimplify further: (1/4) log(4n² -1) - (1/4) log4 - (1/4) logn² -1/4 - n² [ log(4n² -1) - log4 - logn² ].\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's factor (n² - 1/4) = (n - 1/2)(n + 1/2). Not sure. \n\nThis seems quite involved. Perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe using known series expansions or relating the sum to the integral given by the user. \n\nGiven that the user has an expression involving ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx which relates to their sum, and the problem's sum is similar but with different coefficients. Maybe manipulating that known expression to derive the desired sum. \n\nGiven that ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n})). If we can solve for the sum in terms of the integral and other known terms, then perhaps substituting the expression for the integral (which the user also provided involving log π -1 and the sum we need). \n\nWait, the problem's sum is S = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ). Let’s denote the known sum in the integral as T = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ). \n\nNotice that S can be written as (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ). If we can relate T and S. For example, perhaps by substituting m = 2n or something else, but not sure. Alternatively, note that 1/(n(n+1)) = 1/n - 1/(n+1). Similarly, 1/(2n(2n+1)) = 1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1). \n\nBut how does this help? Let's express S as sum [1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1)] ζ(2n)/2^{2n}. So S = (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ). \n\nIf we can relate these two sums to known expressions. The first sum, sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}), might relate to the generating function we discussed earlier. Recall that from the product formula, log(sin πx / πx) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) x^{2k}/k. If we set x = 1/2, then log(sin(π/2)/ (π/2)) = log(1/(π/2)) = - log(π/2) = - sum_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k) (1/2)^{2k} /k. Which implies that sum_{k=1}^∞ ζ(2k)/(k 2^{2k}) = log(π/2). \n\nTherefore, the first term in S is (1/2) log(π/2). \n\nNow, the second sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ). Let’s denote this as U. To find U. \n\nPerhaps integrating the generating function. Since we have sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) x^{2n} = - log(sin πx / πx ). \n\nLet’s consider integrating from 0 to 1/2. Integrate sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) x^{2n} dx = - ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx. \n\nLeft side: sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) ∫₀^{1/2} x^{2n} dx = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) [ x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) ] from 0 to 1/2 = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) (1/2)^{2n+1} / (2n+1) ) = (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ) = (1/2) U. \n\nTherefore, (1/2) U = - ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx. \n\nCompute the integral: ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx) - log πx dx. \n\nSplit into two integrals: ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx) dx - ∫₀^{1/2} log πx dx. \n\nFirst integral: Let’s substitute t = πx, so x = t/π, dx = dt/π. Limits from 0 to π/2. So integral becomes (1/π) ∫₀^{π/2} log(sin t) dt. The integral of log(sin t) from 0 to π/2 is known to be - (π/2) log 2. So first integral is (1/π)( -π/2 log2 ) = - (1/2) log2. \n\nSecond integral: ∫₀^{1/2} log πx dx. Let’s integrate by substitution. Let u = πx, du = π dx. Integral becomes (1/π) ∫₀^{π/2} log u du. Which is (1/π)[ u logu - u ] from 0 to π/2. At π/2: (π/2 log π/2 - π/2). At 0: The limit as u→0 of u logu - u is 0 - 0 = 0. So integral is (1/π)[ (π/2 log π/2 - π/2 ) ] = (1/2) log π/2 - 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the total integral is - (1/2) log2 - [ (1/2) log π/2 - 1/2 ] = - (1/2) log2 - (1/2)(log π - log2) + 1/2 = - (1/2) log2 - (1/2) log π + (1/2) log2 + 1/2 = - (1/2) log π + 1/2. \n\nTherefore, (1/2) U = - [ - (1/2) log π + 1/2 ] = (1/2 log π - 1/2 ). Multiply both sides by 2: U = log π - 1. \n\nTherefore, the second sum U = log π -1. \n\nNow, going back to S = (1/2) log(π/2) - (log π -1 ). \n\nSimplify: (1/2)(log π - log2) - log π +1 = (1/2 log π - 1/2 log2 ) - log π +1 = - (1/2 log π ) - 1/2 log2 +1 = - (1/2)(log π + log2) +1 = - (1/2) log(2π) +1. \n\nWait, this doesn't match the desired result. The problem states that S should be (1/2)(log π -1 ). But according to this calculation, S = (1/2) log(π/2) - (log π -1 ). Let me compute that again:\n\nS = (1/2) log(π/2) - U, where U = log π -1.\n\nSo S = (1/2)(log π - log2) - (log π -1 ) = (1/2 log π - 1/2 log2 ) - log π +1 = -1/2 log π - 1/2 log2 +1. \n\nWait, the desired answer is (1/2)(log π -1 ). Hmm, something's wrong here. Let's check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the previous step, when we computed (1/2) U = - ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx. Then we found the integral was - (1/2) log π + 1/2. So (1/2) U = - [ - (1/2) log π +1/2 ] = (1/2 log π -1/2 ). Therefore, U = log π -1. That part is correct.\n\nThen S = (1/2) sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) - U = (1/2) log(π/2) - (log π -1 ). Because earlier we found sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) = log(π/2). \n\nWait, yes. sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) = log(π/2). Therefore, (1/2) times that is (1/2) log(π/2). Then subtract U = log π -1. \n\nSo S = (1/2)(log π - log2) - log π +1. \n\n= (1/2 log π - 1/2 log2) - log π +1 \n\n= (-1/2 log π -1/2 log2 ) +1 \n\n= - (1/2)(log π + log2 ) +1 \n\n= - (1/2) log(2π) +1. \n\nBut the problem states that S = (1/2)(log π -1 ). Clearly, there's a discrepancy. This suggests an error in the steps. Let's trace back.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split of the sum S was incorrect. Let's re-express S:\n\nS = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}) \n\nWe wrote 1/(2n(2n+1)) = 1/(2n) - 1/(2n+1). Therefore, S = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2^{2n}) [1/(2n) -1/(2n+1)].\n\nThis can be written as sum_{n=1}^∞ [ζ(2n)/(2n 2^{2n}) - ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ) ].\n\nThen, separating into two sums: sum1 - sum2, where sum1 = sum ζ(2n)/(2n 2^{2n}), sum2 = sum ζ(2n)/( (2n+1) 2^{2n} ).\n\nBut sum1 is (1/2) sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) = (1/2) log(π/2) as before. sum2 is U = log π -1.\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2 log(π/2) - (log π -1 ) = (1/2)(log π - log2) - log π +1 = as before.\n\nBut according to this, S = - (1/2) log π - (1/2) log2 +1. \n\nBut the problem states S = 1/2 (log π -1 ). \n\nThis suggests that somewhere in the calculation, there's an error. Let's check the key steps:\n\n1. The split of 1/(2n(2n+1)) into 1/(2n) -1/(2n+1). Correct.\n\n2. The evaluation of sum1 = (1/2) sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) = (1/2) log(π/2). Correct, because sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n}) = log(π/2) from the generating function at x=1/2.\n\n3. The evaluation of sum2 = U = log π -1. This came from integrating the generating function and relating it to the integral of log(sin πx / πx) from 0 to 1/2. Let's verify that calculation again.\n\nThe integral ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx = ∫₀^{1/2} [log(sin πx) - log πx ] dx.\n\nWe computed this as:\n\n- (1/2) log2 - [ (1/2) log π/2 -1/2 ] \n\n= - (1/2) log2 - (1/2)(log π - log2) +1/2 \n\n= - (1/2) log2 - (1/2) log π + (1/2) log2 +1/2 \n\n= - (1/2) log π +1/2. \n\nYes, correct. Then (1/2) U = - [ - (1/2) log π +1/2 ] = (1/2 log π -1/2 ). Hence U = log π -1. Correct.\n\nThus, the calculation seems right, but the final S is not matching. \n\nWait, maybe there's a miscalculation in the final expression. Let's compute S again:\n\nS = (1/2) log(π/2) - (log π -1 )\n\nFirst term: (1/2)(log π - log2)\n\nSecond term: - log π +1 \n\nSo combining: (1/2 log π - 1/2 log2 ) - log π +1 \n\n= (1/2 log π - log π ) + ( -1/2 log2 ) +1 \n\n= (-1/2 log π ) -1/2 log2 +1 \n\n= - (1/2)(log π + log2 ) +1 \n\n= - (1/2) log(2π ) +1 \n\nBut according to the problem, the answer should be (1/2)(log π -1 ). \n\nHmm, there's inconsistency. This suggests either an error in the problem statement, or in our approach. Alternatively, perhaps there's another relation or an error in the integral calculation. \n\nWait, let's check the original integral expression the user provided: \n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n}) )\n\nIf we solve for the sum T = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ), then T = log(π/2) -1/2 - (8/π²) ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx.\n\nBut the user also mentions that ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx is equal to another expression involving log π -1 and a sum which is similar to S. However, without knowing the value of that integral, we can't directly relate S and T. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a connection between the sum S and the integral expression. Let's assume that the problem's answer is correct and our calculation is wrong. \n\nWait, let's compute the final expression we obtained: S = - (1/2) log(2π) +1. Let's compute this:\n\nlog(2π) = log2 + logπ. So S = - (1/2)(log2 + logπ ) +1 = - (1/2) log2 - (1/2) logπ +1. \n\nBut the problem's answer is (1/2)(log π -1 ). \n\nEquating our result to the problem's answer:\n\n- (1/2) log2 - (1/2) logπ +1 = (1/2) logπ -1/2 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n- log2 - logπ +2 = logπ -1 \n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- log2 - logπ +2 - logπ +1 =0 → -2 logπ - log2 +3 =0. This is not true. Therefore, there must be a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the error is in the evaluation of the integral. Let's re-examine the integral ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx.\n\nWe split it into two parts: ∫ log sin πx dx - ∫ log πx dx. \n\nFirst integral, after substitution, became (1/π) ∫₀^{π/2} log sin t dt = (1/π)( - (π/2) log2 ) = - (1/2) log2. Correct.\n\nSecond integral: ∫₀^{1/2} log πx dx. Let’s integrate log πx: \n\nIntegral of log πx dx = x log πx - x. Evaluated from 0 to 1/2. At 1/2: (1/2) log(π/2) -1/2. At 0: The limit as x→0 of x log πx -x. The term x log πx tends to 0 (since x log x →0 ), and -x →0. So total is (1/2 log(π/2) -1/2 ) -0 = (1/2)(log π - log2 ) -1/2. \n\nThus, the second integral is (1/2 log π -1/2 log2 -1/2 ). \n\nTherefore, the total integral is first part - second part:\n\n- (1/2) log2 - [ (1/2 log π -1/2 log2 -1/2 ) ] \n\n= -1/2 log2 -1/2 log π +1/2 log2 +1/2 \n\n= -1/2 log π +1/2 \n\nYes, correct. Therefore, (1/2) U = - [ -1/2 log π +1/2 ] = (1/2 log π -1/2 ). Hence U = log π -1. Correct.\n\nBut then S = (1/2) log(π/2) - (log π -1 ) = (1/2 log π -1/2 log2 ) - log π +1 = -1/2 log π -1/2 log2 +1. \n\nWhich is not equal to (1/2)(log π -1 ). Unless there's a relation between log2 and 1. For example, if 1 = (1/2)(log π -1 ) +1/2 log(2π ). Let's check:\n\nSuppose -1/2 log π -1/2 log2 +1 = (1/2)(log π -1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n- log π - log2 +2 = log π -1 \n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- log π - log2 +2 - log π +1 =0 → -2 log π - log2 +3 =0. \n\nThis is not true unless specific values of π and log2 satisfy this. For example, π ≈3.1415, log π ≈1.1447, log2 ≈0.6931.\n\nLeft-hand side: -2*1.1447 -0.6931 +3 ≈ -2.2894 -0.6931 +3 ≈-2.9825 +3≈0.0175. Not zero. Close to zero, but not exactly. This suggests numerical approximation might be close, but analytically, they're not equal. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternative route: Let's consider the expression the user provided:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - T ), where T = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ).\n\nThey also mentioned another expression for this integral:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - T )\n\nBut according to another known formula, the user says:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - T )\n\nAnd another known expression:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log π -1 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n}) )\n\nWait, maybe the user provided another expression which I missed. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe user says: \"I've known the following expression: ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log(π/2) -1/2 - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} )). I got interested in this infinite series, and I've just known the following similar formula without any proof: sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} )=1/2 (log π -1 ).\"\n\nSo, according to this, if we denote the sum in the problem as S = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ), then the known integral expression is ∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log π/2 -1/2 - T ), where T = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ). But the user also says they have another expression for the same integral:\n\n∫₀^{π/2} x log sinx dx = (π²/8)(log π -1 - 2S ). Because sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = S, so 2S would be sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIf S = sum ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ), then 2S = sum ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ). But how does this relate to T?\n\nThe user's known integral expression involves T = sum ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ). \n\nIf we set the two expressions for the integral equal:\n\n(π²/8)(log π/2 -1/2 - T ) = (π²/8)(log π -1 - 2S )\n\nDivide both sides by π²/8:\n\nlog π/2 -1/2 - T = log π -1 - 2S \n\nSimplify:\n\nlog π - log2 -1/2 - T = log π -1 -2S \n\nCancel log π:\n\n- log2 -1/2 - T = -1 -2S \n\nRearrange:\n\n- log2 -1/2 +1 +2S = T \n\nThus,\n\nT = 2S + (1 - log2 -1/2 ) = 2S + (1/2 - log2 )\n\nBut from earlier, we have T = sum ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ). If we can express T in terms of S, and vice versa. \n\nBut from the generating function, we found that sum ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n} ) = log(π/2 ). \n\nAlso, T can be written as sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ) = sum_{n=1}^∞ [1/n - 1/(n+1)] ζ(2n)/2^{2n} = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n 2^{2n} ) - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (n+1) 2^{2n} ). \n\nFirst sum is log(π/2 ). Second sum is sum_{k=2}^∞ ζ(2(k-1))/ (k 2^{2(k-1)} )) = sum_{k=2}^∞ ζ(2k -2)/ (k 2^{2k -2} ). Not sure. Alternatively, shift index: let m = n+1. Then sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (n+1) 2^{2n} ) = sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2(m-1))/(m 2^{2(m-1)} ) = sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m -2)/(m 2^{2m -2} ). \n\nThis seems complicated. But if we denote this as sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m -2)/(m 2^{2m -2} ), which doesn't directly relate to known sums. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing ζ(2n) in terms of Bernoulli numbers? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, recall that ζ(2n) can be expressed using the Bernoulli numbers: ζ(2n) = (2^{2n-1} π^{2n} |B_{2n}| ) / (2n)! ). But this might not help here. \n\nAlternatively, using the integral expressions. \n\nBut according to the user's two expressions for the same integral:\n\nlog π/2 -1/2 - T = log π -1 -2S \n\nRearranged, T = 2S +1/2 - log2 -1/2 = 2S - log2. \n\nBut we also have T = sum ζ(2n)/(n(n+1)2^{2n} ). \n\nFrom previous calculations, we found that S = - (1/2) log(2π ) +1. \n\nBut substituting S into T = 2S - log2:\n\nT = 2(- (1/2) log(2π ) +1 ) - log2 = - log(2π ) +2 - log2 = - log2 - logπ +2 - log2 = -2 log2 - logπ +2. \n\nBut from the generating function, T can be written as sum_{n=1}^∞ [1/n -1/(n+1)] ζ(2n)/2^{2n} = sum1 - sum2 = log(π/2 ) - sum2. \n\nBut sum2 is sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/( (n+1) 2^{2n} ). Let's denote m = n+1, then sum2 = sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2(m-1))/(m 2^{2(m-1)} ) = sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m-2)/(m 2^{2m-2} ). \n\nThis doesn't easily relate to known sums. However, perhaps using generating functions again. \n\nConsider sum_{m=2}^∞ ζ(2m-2) x^{2m-2} = sum_{m=2}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ x^{2m-2}/k^{2m-2} = sum_{k=1}^∞ sum_{m=2}^∞ (x/k)^{2m-2} = sum_{k=1}^∞ sum_{m=2}^∞ (x^2/k^2)^{m-1} = sum_{k=1}^∞ [ sum_{m=1}^∞ (x^2/k^2)^m } ] = sum_{k=1}^∞ (x^2/k^2)/(1 -x^2/k^2) ) = sum_{k=1}^∞ x^2/(k^2 -x^2). \n\nBut integrating or differentiating this might not directly help. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the fact that my initial approach led to a result conflicting with the problem's statement, I must conclude that there's a different approach needed. Perhaps using the known integral expression provided by the user and relating S to T. \n\nGiven the two expressions for the same integral:\n\n(π²/8)(log π/2 -1/2 - T ) = (π²/8)(log π -1 - 2S )\n\nTherefore, canceling π²/8:\n\nlog π/2 -1/2 - T = log π -1 - 2S \n\nRearranged: -T +2S = log π -1 - log π/2 +1/2 \n\nSimplify RHS: log π -1 - log π + log2 +1/2 = -1 + log2 +1/2 = log2 -1/2 \n\nTherefore, -T +2S = log2 -1/2 \n\nBut earlier, we have T = 2S - log2 \n\nSubstitute T = 2S - log2 into -T +2S = log2 -1/2:\n\n- (2S - log2 ) +2S = log2 -1/2 \n\nSimplify: -2S + log2 +2S = log2 -1/2 → log2 = log2 -1/2 \n\nThis implies 0 = -1/2, which is a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that the two expressions provided by the user for the integral are inconsistent, which likely indicates a mistake in the problem statement or in the provided expressions. However, assuming the problem statement is correct and the desired sum S equals 1/2 (log π -1 ), perhaps there's a different route.\n\nAlternative approach: Given that the user mentions the product formula for sin πx and suggests using it, perhaps consider taking derivatives or integrals of the logarithm of the product formula. \n\nRecall that:\n\nlog sin πx = log πx + sum_{n=1}^∞ log(1 -x²/n² )\n\nDifferentiating both sides:\n\nπ cot πx = 1/x + sum_{n=1}^∞ (-2x/n²)/(1 -x²/n² )\n\n= 1/x - 2x sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(n² -x² )\n\nBut this might not directly help. Alternatively, integrate cot πx. \n\nAlternatively, consider integrating x log sin πx from 0 to 1/2, which we did earlier, but that led to the conflicting result. \n\nAlternatively, start from the known sum for log(sin πx) and manipulate it to find S. \n\nGiven log(sin πx / πx ) = - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n) x^{2n}/n. \n\nIntegrate both sides from 0 to a:\n\n∫₀^a log(sin πx / πx ) dx = - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/n ∫₀^a x^{2n} dx = - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)) a^{2n+1}\n\nChoose a =1/2:\n\nLeft side: ∫₀^{1/2} log(sin πx / πx ) dx = as before, equals -1/2 log π +1/2 \n\nRight side: - sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)) (1/2)^{2n+1} = - (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = - (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} )\n\nBut from left side: -1/2 log π +1/2 = - (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} )\n\nMultiply both sides by -2:\n\nlog π -1 = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} )\n\nBut the problem's sum is sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ). Notice that the denominator here has an extra factor of 2n. \n\nWait, sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = log π -1 \n\nBut the problem's sum is S = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = (1/2) sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = (1/2)(log π -1 )\n\nAh! Here it is. \n\nWe have:\n\nsum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = log π -1 \n\nTherefore, multiplying both sides by 1/2:\n\nS = sum_{n=1}^∞ ζ(2n)/(2n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) = (1/2)(log π -1 )\n\nWhich is exactly the desired result. \n\nThis resolves the earlier confusion. The key step was integrating both sides of the generating function's logarithm and choosing the appropriate limits. Specifically, integrating from 0 to 1/2, which led to the sum involving ζ(2n)/(n(2n+1)2^{2n} ) equals log π -1. Hence, dividing by 2 gives the desired sum S.\n\nSo the correct approach was to integrate the generating function equation, leading directly to the required result.",
