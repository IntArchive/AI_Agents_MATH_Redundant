    "Content": "Show that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\displaystyle \\left( \\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{k}{n}\\bigr)\\right)^{-k}=\\frac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma-1}$$ where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni Constant . Motivation : One can show that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\displaystyle\\left(n-\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{1}{n}\\bigr)\\right)=\\gamma.$$ This means that $\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{1}{n}\\bigr)\\sim n$ when $n$ is large. So we have that (even if is not correct) $\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{k}{n}\\bigr)\\sim \\frac{n}{k}$ . It implies that $$\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\displaystyle\\left(\\Gamma\\bigl(\\frac{k}{n}\\bigr)\\right)^{-k}\\sim \\sum_{k=1}^{n}(\\frac{k}{n})^k.$$ Since the limit of the right sum exists and its value is $\\frac{e}{e-1}$ . Numerical calculations show that the limit of the sum involving the Gamma function would be $\\frac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma− 1}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Step 1. If \n  $$I_1(n)=\\sum_{1\\leq k\\leq\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\\right)^{-k}$$\n  Then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}I_1(n)=0$. Proof. Indeed, since $\\Gamma$ is decreasing on $(0,1]$ we have\n$$\nI_1(n)\\leq\\sum_{1\\leq k\\leq\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\right)^{-k}\\leq\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\right)^{-k}=\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1/\\sqrt{n})-1}$$\nand step 1. follows. Step 2. If \n  $$I_2(n)=\\sum_{\\sqrt{n}<k\\leq n/2}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\\right)^{-k}$$\n  Then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}I_2(n)=0$. Proof. Recall that $\\Gamma$ attains its minimum $\\approx0.8856$, on $[1,2]$, at some some point $x_0\\approx1.4616$. In particular, $\\Gamma(x)\\geq2/3$ for $1\\leq x\\leq 2$. So, for $\\sqrt{n}<k\\leq n/2$ we have\n$$\n\\frac{k}{n}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=\\Gamma\\left(1+\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\n\\geq\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThus,  for $\\sqrt{n}<k\\leq n/2$, we have $\\Gamma(k/n)>4/3$. It follows that\n$$\nI_2(n)\\leq \\sum_{k>\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^k=4\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil}\n$$\nand step 2. follows. Step 3. If \n  $$I_3(n)=\\sum_{n/2<k\\leq n}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\\right)^{-k}$$\n  Then $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}I_3(n)=\\dfrac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma-1}$.\n  where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Proof. Note first that, with $p=n-k$,\n$$\nI_3(n)=\\sum_{0\\leq p<n/2}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(1-\\frac{p}{n}\\right)\\right)^{p-n}\n=\\sum_{p=0}^\\infty a_p(n)\n$$\nwith\n$$a_p(n)=\\left\\{\\matrix{\\left(\\Gamma\\left(1-\\frac{p}{n}\\right)\\right)^{p-n}&\\hbox{if}& 0\\leq p<n/2\\cr0&\\hbox{otherwise}}\\right.$$\nNow, since $\\Gamma(1)=1$ and $\\Gamma'(1)=-\\gamma$ we have, for a fixed $p$ and large $n$:\n$$(p-n)\\ln\\Gamma\\left(1-\\frac{p}{n}\\right)=(p-n)\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma p}{n}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\\right)=-\\gamma p+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$$\nThus\n$$\n\\forall\\,p\\geq 0,\\quad \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_p(n)=e^{-\\gamma p}.\\tag{1}\n$$\nNow, we will need the next lemma. Lemma. For $t\\in[1/2,1]$ we have $(\\Gamma(t))^{t/(1-t)}\\geq \\Gamma(1/2)=\\sqrt{\\pi}.$ Taking, this lemma for granted, we conclude by taking $t=1-p/n$ when $0\\leq p<n/2$, that \n$$\n\\forall\\,p\\geq 0,n\\geq 1,\\quad  a_p(n)\\leq \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^p.\n\\tag{2}\n$$\nand clearly, $$\\sum_{p=0}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^p<+\\infty\\tag{3}$$  Combining $(1)$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ we conclude that\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}I_3(n)=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{p=0}^\\infty a_p(n)\n=\\sum_{p=0}^\\infty\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_p(n)=\n\\sum_{p=0}^\\infty e^{-\\gamma p}=\\frac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma-1}.$$ The desired conclusion follows:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{1\\leq k\\leq n}\\left(\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\\right)^{-k}=\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(I_1(n)+I_2(n)+I_3(n))=\\frac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma-1}.\n$$ Proof of the Lemma. Let $f(t)=\\dfrac{t}{1-t}\\ln\\Gamma(t)$.\nThen $f'(t)=\\dfrac{g(t)}{(1-t)^2}$ with\n$$g(t)=\\ln\\Gamma(t)+t(1-t)\\psi(t);\\quad\\hbox{where $\\psi(t)=\\Gamma'(t)/\\Gamma(t)$}$$\nand $g'(t)=(1-t)h(t)$ with\n$$h(t)=2\\psi(t)+t\\psi'(t)$$\nand finally $h'(t)=3\\psi'(t)+t\\psi''(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{3k+t}{(k+t)^3}>0$. So, $h$ is increasing, and $\\lim_{t\\to0^+}h(t)=-\\infty$, $h(1)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}-2\\gamma>0$. This proves that $h(t)<0$ for $0<t<x_0$ and $h(t)>0$ for $x_0<t<1$, for some $x_0$. And $g$ is decreasing on $[0,x_0]$ and increasing on $[x_0,1]$. But \n$\\lim_{t\\to0^+}g(t)=+\\infty$, $g(1)=0$. This proves that $g$ has exactly one change of sign on $(0,1)$ from positive to negative. This proves that the minimum of $f$ on $[1/2,1]$ is $\\min(f(1/2),f(1))=f(1/2)$, and the lemma is proved.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about evaluating the limit of a sum involving the Gamma function as n approaches infinity. The goal is to show that the limit equals e^γ/(e^γ - 1), where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the key steps are to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then state the problem clearly.\n\nIn the original problem, the user mentions that n approaches positive infinity. The sum is from k=1 to n of [Γ(k/n)]^(-k). The user also provides motivation by stating that Γ(1/n) ~ n when n is large, leading to Γ(k/n) ~ n/k. This approximation suggests replacing Γ(k/n) with n/k, which transforms the sum into something resembling ∑(k/n)^k, whose limit is known to be e/(e-1). However, numerical calculations indicate the actual limit involves e^γ instead.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be:\n- n is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- Each term in the sum involves Γ(k/n) raised to the power of -k.\n- The approximation Γ(k/n) ~ n/k when n is large (though noted as not strictly correct, but used heuristically).\n- The sum using the approximation converges to e/(e-1), but the actual problem's limit is e^γ/(e^γ -1).\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions are more about the conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem is to prove the limit, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the problem is set. The user's motivation includes that Γ(1/n) ~ n, leading to Γ(k/n) ~ n/k. But is that an assumption of the problem, or part of the motivation?\n\nThe original problem states: Show that the limit equals e^γ/(e^γ -1). The assumptions would be the given conditions. The problem doesn't explicitly state assumptions like n is integer, but since it's a limit as n approaches infinity, n is an integer (as the sum is from k=1 to n). Also, γ is a constant (Euler-Mascheroni). So, the assumptions should list the key conditions and definitions given in the problem.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\nthe sum is from k=1 to n of [Γ(k/n)]^(-k).\n\nProblem: Show that the limit equals e^γ/(e^γ -1).\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't state any divisibility, but it's a limit as n approaches infinity. So, the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer approaching infinity, γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and each term in the sum is as defined. The problem is to evaluate the limit.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition, which was part of the problem's original statement. In the current problem, the original statement doesn't have such conditions, except that n approaches infinity. The mention of Γ(k/n) being approximated is part of the motivation provided by the user, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions should only include what's given in the problem statement, not the motivation.\n\nSo, original problem says: Show that the limit as n approaches +infty of the sum from k=1 to n of [Γ(k/n)]^(-k) equals e^γ/(e^γ -1). The assumptions would then be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n approaches infinity.\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- Each term in the sum is [Γ(k/n)]^(-k) for k from 1 to n.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would list these assumptions line by line, each addressing one property.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" which was not in the original problem's statement. Wait, no. Let me check the example again. The original example problem was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Unless perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, maybe in the original problem, the user intended to have n divisible by 7, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps there was an error in the example.\n\nBut regardless, following the user's example, the assistant added assumptions beyond the original problem's statement. However, in the current problem, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. So perhaps in the example, the assistant filtered out unrelated information and listed necessary assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the correct problem requires n divisible by 7. Or perhaps the example was illustrative.\n\nBut given that, the current problem's assumptions should be based on the problem statement, not the motivation. The problem statement is to show the limit equals e^γ/(e^γ -1), where γ is Euler-Mascheroni. So, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer approaching infinity.\n- γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n- The sum is taken from k=1 to n.\n- Each term in the sum is [Γ(k/n)]^(-k).\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is one property applied to one object. So here, similar.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nn approaches infinity,\nγ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant,\neach term in the sum is [Γ(k/n)]^{-k} for k from 1 to n.\n\nProblem: Show that $$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow+\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)\\right)^{-k}=\\frac{e^\\gamma}{e^\\gamma-1}.$$\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption that each term is [Γ(k/n)]^{-k} is part of the problem statement, but the problem is to evaluate the limit. So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, such as n being a positive integer, approaching infinity, γ being the constant, and the sum structure.\n\nYes, that seems right. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The problem is to show the limit equals the given expression.",
