    "Content": "I'm studying representation theory and in the book (Fulton and Harris) the author makes the following proposition with the following proof: Proposition : For any representation $V$ of a finite group $G$ , there is a decomposition $$V = V_1^{\\oplus a_1}\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus V_k^{\\oplus a_k},$$ where the $V_i$ are distinct irreducible representations. The decomposition of $V$ into a direct sum of the $k$ factors is unique, as are the $V_i$ that occur and their multiplicities. Proof : It follows from Schur's lemma that if $W$ is another representation of $G$ , with a decomposition $W = \\bigoplus W_j^{\\oplus b_j}$ , and $\\varphi : V\\to W$ is a map of representations, then $\\varphi$ must map the factor $V_i^{\\oplus a_i}$ into the factor $W_j^{\\oplus b_j}$ for which $W_j\\simeq V_i$ ; when applied to the identity map of $V$ to $V$ , the stated uniqueness follows. I must confess I didn't understand. The fact that we can decompose $V$ like this I do understand that follows from the fact that if $V$ has a proper nonzero subrepresentation $W$ then there is another subrepresentation $W'$ such that $V = W\\oplus W'$ . In that case, if either $W$ or $W'$ are not irreducible we can apply the same idea to them, until we have the desired decomposition. Now, this proof of uniqueness I really can't understand. I mean, uniqueness means that if we have $$V = V_1^{\\oplus a_1}\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus V_k^{\\oplus a_k}\\simeq W_1^{\\oplus b_1}\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus W_{r}^{\\oplus b_r},$$ then we have $k = r$ , $a_i = b_i$ and $W_i\\simeq V_i$ . I can't understand how this argument the author presents shows all of this. Indeed the whole point is that $V$ has these two decompositions then they are isomorphic, so that there exists one isomorphism $$\\varphi : V_1^{\\oplus a_1}\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus V_k^{\\oplus a_k}\\to W_1^{\\oplus b_1}\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus W_r^{\\oplus b_r}.$$ If we restrict it to $V_i$ we get one isomorphism $\\varphi : V_i\\to \\varphi(V_i)$ . But why $\\varphi(V_i)=W_j$ for some $j$ ? I mean, couldn't $\\varphi(V_i)$ be some other subspace of the direct sum of the $W_i$ which is not one of the $W_i$ themselves? So how to understand this proof about the decomposition of a representation? What really is the argument used in this proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think this may be easier to understand if you change the notation a bit.  Instead of grouping the direct summands by their isomorphism type, just list them all without grouping.  So we have two decompositions $V=\\bigoplus S_m$ and $W=\\bigoplus T_n$ , where each $S_m$ and each $T_n$ is irreducible.  Given an isomorphism $\\varphi:V\\to W$ , let $\\varphi_{mn}:S_m\\to T_n$ be the composition of $\\varphi$ with the inclusion $S_m\\to V$ and the projection $W\\to T_n$ .  By Schur's lemma, each $\\varphi_{mn}$ is either an isomorphism or $0$ . Now since $\\varphi$ is injective, for each $m$ there must exist some $n$ such that $\\varphi_{mn}\\neq 0$ .  Thus for each $m$ , there exists some $n$ such that $\\varphi_{mn}$ is an isomorphism, and hence $T_n\\cong S_m$ .  Moreover, $\\varphi_{mn}=0$ for all $n$ such that $T_n\\not\\cong S_m$ .  This means that image of the restriction of $\\varphi$ to $S_m$ is contained in the direct sum of all the $T_n$ 's which are isomorphic to $S_m$ . Now fix an irreducible representation $R$ and let $A\\subseteq V$ be the direct sum of all the $S_m$ 's that are isomorphic to $R$ , and let $B$ be the direct sum of all the other $S_m$ 's, so $V=A\\oplus B$ .  Similarly, let $C\\subseteq W$ be the direct sum of all the $T_n$ 's that are isomorphic to $R$ , and $D$ be the direct sum of all the other $T_n$ 's, so $W=C\\oplus D$ .  The discussion above shows that $\\varphi(A)\\subseteq C$ and $\\varphi(B)\\subseteq D$ .  Since $\\varphi$ is surjective, we must have $\\varphi(A)=C$ and $\\varphi(B)=D$ .  Thus $\\varphi$ gives an isomorphism from $A$ to $C$ .  It follows that the number of $S_m$ 's which are isomorphic to $R$ is equal to the number of $T_n$ 's which are isomorphic to $R$ , which is exactly what we wanted to prove. Note that you're right that, for instance, $\\varphi(S_m)$ might not actually be equal to any of the $T_n$ .  For instance, if $G$ is trivial, this is just saying that if you have two bases for the vector space, you can have a vector in one basis that is not a scalar multiple of any single vector in the other basis.  But $\\varphi(S_m)$ is still isomorphic to one of the $T_n$ .  Moreover, $\\varphi(A)$ is actually equal to $C$ , or in the language of the question, $\\varphi(V_i^{\\oplus a_i})=W_j^{\\oplus b_j}$ for some $j$ .  So while the individual irreducible summands might not map to individual irreducible summands, when you group together all the irreducible summands of a given isomorphism type, they map to the sum of all the irreducible summands of the same isomorphism type.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a knowledgeable bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided involved breaking down the problem into assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The question is about understanding the uniqueness part of the decomposition of a representation into a direct sum of irreducible ones, as presented in Fulton and Harris. The user is confused about how the proof using Schur's lemma ensures uniqueness, particularly why the isomorphism maps each V_i to some W_j.\n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The example shows that assumptions should list each condition on one object per line. \n\nLooking at the original problem: The user is questioning the proof of uniqueness in the decomposition. The proposition states that any representation V can be decomposed into a direct sum of distinct irreducibles with unique multiplicities. The proof uses Schur's lemma, saying that a map φ between two decompositions must map each V_i into W_j where W_j is isomorphic to V_i. The user is confused because they think φ(V_i) could be a subspace of the direct sum that's not one of the W_j.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be the conditions given in the proposition and the proof. The problem is to understand how the uniqueness follows from Schur's lemma, specifically why φ must map each V_i to a W_j. \n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property. The key assumptions here are:\n\n- V is a representation of a finite group G.\n- V can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations with multiplicities.\n- Schur's lemma applies, which states that homomorphisms between irreducibles are isomorphisms or zero.\n- The isomorphism φ between two decompositions is a G-equivariant map (a map of representations).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is then to show the uniqueness of the decomposition, i.e., that the isomorphism implies the multiplicities and irreducibles are the same.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is a single condition on one object. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a representation of a finite group G,\nV decomposes into a direct sum of distinct irreducible representations with multiplicities,\nSchur's lemma applies (homomorphisms between irreducible representations are isomorphisms or zero),\nφ: V → W is an isomorphism of representations where W has another decomposition into irreducibles.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decomposition of V into a direct sum of irreducible representations is unique up to isomorphism, i.e., the multiplicities and the irreducible components are uniquely determined.\n\nWait, the original problem's question is more about understanding how the given proof using Schur's lemma works, not just stating the problem. The user is asking to explain the argument in the proof. But according to the format, we need to structure the problem as per the user's requirements. However, the example given by the user includes the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is to \"Prove that the decomposition into a direct sum of irreducible representations is unique, with the stated uniqueness of the components and multiplicities.\"\n\nBut the user's confusion is about the proof's step, so maybe the problem statement is the same as the proposition, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the proposition and the proof's context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is as stated in the proposition: Prove the uniqueness part of the decomposition. The assumptions would then include the properties of the group (finite), the representation V, the applicability of Schur's lemma, and the existence of decompositions.\n\nHmm. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Wait, but the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7; the user added that as part of the formatted problem. Wait, no. Wait the example given by the user shows that in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But in the original problem, the proposition was to prove for every integer n, the number is divisible by 91. But the user formatted the problem with an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that was a mistake? Or perhaps the example was not correctly formatted. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\", but in their formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow that format regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the example's original problem had the assumption n divisible by 7. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which would mean n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example seems incorrect. But the user might have intended that. Regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the proposition is that for any representation V of a finite group G, there is a decomposition into a direct sum of irreducibles with unique multiplicities. The proof uses Schur's lemma. The user's question is about understanding this proof, specifically the uniqueness part.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that G is a finite group, V is a representation of G, V can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations, and Schur's lemma applies. Also, φ is an isomorphism of representations between two decompositions. Then the problem is to show that under these assumptions, the decomposition is unique.\n\nBut the user's confusion is about how the proof works. So perhaps the problem is to explain why the isomorphism φ must map each V_i to some W_j, thereby establishing uniqueness.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the representations, the decompositions, Schur's lemma, and the existence of an isomorphism. The problem is to prove the uniqueness.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- G is a finite group.\n- V is a representation of G.\n- V decomposes as a direct sum of distinct irreducible representations: V = V₁^⊕a₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Vₖ^⊕aₖ.\n- W is another decomposition of V into irreducible representations: W = W₁^⊕b₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Wᵣ^⊕bᵣ.\n- φ: V → W is an isomorphism of representations (G-equivariant).\n- Schur's lemma applies: any homomorphism between irreducible representations is either zero or an isomorphism.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decompositions of V into direct sums of irreducible representations are unique, i.e., k = r, a_i = b_i, and each V_i is isomorphic to W_i.\n\nBut the user's question is specifically about how the given proof using Schur's lemma establishes that φ must map each V_i into some W_j. So the problem, as per the user's original question, is to understand why φ restricts to an isomorphism between each V_i and some W_j, hence proving uniqueness.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that φ is an isomorphism of representations, each V_i and W_j are irreducible, and Schur's lemma. The problem is to show that φ maps each V_i into a unique W_j, leading to the conclusion that the decompositions are the same.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nV is a representation of G,\nV is decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations: V = V₁^⊕a₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Vₖ^⊕aₖ,\nW is another decomposition of V into irreducible subrepresentations: W = W₁^⊕b₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Wᵣ^⊕bᵣ,\nφ: V → W is an isomorphism of G-representations,\nSchur's lemma holds: any nonzero morphism between irreducible representations is an isomorphism.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decomposition of V into a direct sum of irreducible representations is unique, i.e., k = r, each a_i = b_i, and each V_i is isomorphic to W_i.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions need to be more granular, each on one line and addressing one property. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nV is a representation of G,\nV can be decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations,\nEach irreducible subrepresentation in the decomposition is distinct (non-isomorphic),\nSchur's lemma applies to homomorphisms between irreducible representations,\nφ: V → V is an isomorphism of representations.\n\nWait, in the original proof, the author applies it to the identity map. So perhaps the key assumption is that we have two decompositions of the same V, and the isomorphism is the identity map. Then, via Schur's lemma, the identity map must map each V_i to the corresponding W_j.\n\nBut the user's confusion is that if φ is an isomorphism between two decompositions, then φ(V_i) could be a subspace of the direct sum that is not exactly one of the W_j. The author's argument is that φ must map V_i into the W_j where W_j ≅ V_i. So how does that follow?\n\nSo the key assumptions are:\n\n- V has two decompositions into irreducible subrepresentations.\n- φ is an isomorphism between these decompositions (as representations).\n- Schur's lemma: any homomorphism from an irreducible representation to another is either zero or an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nV is a representation of G,\nV = V₁^⊕a₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Vₖ^⊕aₖ, where each V_i is irreducible and distinct,\nV = W₁^⊕b₁ ⊕ ... ⊕ Wᵣ^⊕bᵣ, where each W_j is irreducible and distinct,\nφ: V → V is an isomorphism of G-representations,\nSchur's lemma: If X and Y are irreducible representations, any G-equivariant map X → Y is zero or an isomorphism.\n\nProblem: Prove that the decompositions are unique, i.e., k = r, a_i = b_i, and each V_i ≅ W_i.\n\nBut the user is asking specifically about the step where φ(V_i) is claimed to be some W_j. So perhaps the problem is to show that under these assumptions, each φ(V_i) is equal to some W_j, hence proving the uniqueness.\n\nSo to fit the format, the assumptions are each condition, and the problem is the statement to prove.\n\nAnother angle: the user's problem is to understand the proof's logic. So the problem is to \"Explain why φ must map each V_i into some W_j, hence establishing the uniqueness of the decomposition.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be stated as a directive like \"Prove that...\". So in the example, it's \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Similarly here, it should be \"Prove that the decomposition is unique...\".\n\nPutting it all together, the formatted problem should have assumptions and the problem statement. The assumptions are the conditions given in the proposition and the proof setup. The problem is to prove the uniqueness.",
