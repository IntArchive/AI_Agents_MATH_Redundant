    "Content": "Theorem (Single factor theorem) Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $P\\in R[X]$, where $R[X]$ is the polynomial ring over the indeterminate $X$.  Suppose $P(\\alpha)=0$.  Then $X-\\alpha$ divides $P(X)$. If $R$ is a field , then I know the following proof: Proof (for a field): Using polynomial long division, we can write: $$\nP(X)=Q(X)(X-\\alpha)+r\n$$ where $r\\in R$ is a constant, since it has to have strictly lower degree than $X-\\alpha$.  But then, putting $X=\\alpha$, we get $0=0+r$, so $r=0$, and we win.  $\\Box$ The proof above doesn't work over an arbitrary ring, because we cannot always do polynomial long division over an arbitrary ring.  However, I have read in a number of places (including on this site) that the theorem is true when $R$ is an arbitrary commutative ring.  I haven't been able to find anything other than the proof for fields outlined above, either online or in Chrystal's Algebra .  One idea I had was to try and use Gauss's lemma, but I'd like to know if there is a 'standard' proof of this fact.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem from Math Stack Exchange. The user is talking about the Single Factor Theorem over an arbitrary commutative ring. The original question is about proving that if a polynomial P evaluated at α is zero, then X - α divides P(X). They mention that the proof for fields uses polynomial long division, but that doesn't work for arbitrary rings. The user is asking for a standard proof of this fact for commutative rings.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. Let's look at the key points:\n\n1. R is a commutative ring.\n2. P is in R[X], the polynomial ring over R in indeterminate X.\n3. P(α) = 0 for some α in R.\n4. The problem is to prove that X - α divides P(X).\n\nWait, the original theorem states that if P(α) = 0, then X - α divides P(X), and this is over any commutative ring R. The user is aware of the proof for fields using polynomial division but notes that division isn't always possible in arbitrary rings. They're looking for a different approach.\n\nIn the example given, assumptions were listed line by line, each applying to one object. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- R is a commutative ring.\n- P is an element of R[X].\n- α is an element of R.\n- P(α) = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that X - α divides P(X) in R[X].\n\nWait, the original problem statement also mentions that when R is a field, the proof uses polynomial division, but for arbitrary commutative rings, that method doesn't work. However, the user is asserting that the theorem still holds. So the key assumptions are the ring being commutative, P being a polynomial in R[X], and P evaluated at α is zero. The problem is to show divisibility by X - α.\n\nI need to structure this as per the given format. Let me check the example again. The example had assumptions each on separate lines, each addressing one property. So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nP ∈ R[X],\nα ∈ R,\nP(α) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that X - α divides P(X) in R[X].\n\nWait, but the original problem's title mentions the \"single factor theorem over an arbitrary commutative ring,\" and the user is seeking the proof. The problem statement as per the user is to prove that theorem, given those conditions. So I need to make sure that all the necessary assumptions are listed. The key here is that R is commutative, P is a polynomial over R, and that evaluation at α gives zero. The problem is to show divisibility by X - α.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So R is commutative (assumption about R), P is in R[X] (assumption about P), α is in R (assumption about α), and P(α) = 0 (another condition about P and α). The problem is to prove divisibility. That should fit the format.",
