    "Content": "I found crazy (for me at least) induction example, in fact it just would be nice to prove. (Even have problems with starting) Any hints are highly valued: $$0^2\\binom{n}{0}+1^2\\binom{n}{1}+2^2\\binom{n}{2}+\\cdots+n^2\\binom{n}{n}=n(1+n)2^{n-2} $$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Marvis has given a typically excellent answer. I'll go ahead and show you an induction-style proof, just in case you're interested. A useful basic combinatoric fact for this induction proof is Pascal's identity: $$\\binom{n+1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}+\\binom{n}{k-1}\\tag{1}$$ Another nice basic fact is $$\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}k=2^n\\tag{2}$$ for all $n\\in\\Bbb N$ . For each $n$ , define $$f(n)=n(1+n)2^{n-2}\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad g(n)=\\sum_{k=0}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k},$$ so what we're trying to show is that $f(n)=g(n)$ for all $n$ . In the $n=0$ case, this is clear, yes? For the induction step, supposing that $f(n)=g(n)$ for some $n$ , we must show that $f(n+1)=g(n+1)$ . Observe on the one hand that $$f(n+1)=(n+1)(2+n)2^{n-1}=(n+1)2^n+n(n+1)2^{n-1}=(n+1)2^n+2f(n),$$ so by inductive hypothesis, $$2g(n)=2f(n)=f(n+1)-(n+1)2^n.\\tag{3}$$ On the other hand, we have $$\\begin{align}g(n+1) &= \\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}k^2\\binom{n+1}k\\\\ &=\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}k^2\\binom{n+1}{k}\\\\ &=(n+1)^2\\binom{n+1}{n+1}+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\binom{n+1}{k}\\\\ &\\overset{(1)}{=}(n+1)^2+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\left[\\binom{n}{k}+\\binom{n}{k-1}\\right]\\\\ &=(n+1)^2+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k-1}\\\\ &=(n+1)^2+\\sum_{k=0}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k-1}\\\\ &=(n+1)^2+g(n)+\\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k-1}\\\\ &=(n+1)^2+g(n)+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(k+1)^2\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &=n^2+2n+1+g(n)+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k^2\\binom{n}{k}+2\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &=(n^2+2n+1)\\binom{n}{n}+g(n)+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k^2\\binom{n}{k}+2\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &=g(n)+\\sum_{k=0}^nk^2\\binom{n}{k}+2\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &=2g(n)+2\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &\\overset{(3)}{=}f(n+1)-(n+1)2^n+2\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}+\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &\\overset{(2)}{=}f(n+1)-n2^n+2\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &=f(n+1)-2\\left(n2^{n-1}-\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}\\right)\\end{align}$$ Hence, to see that $f(n+1)=g(n+1)$ , it suffices that $$n2^{n-1}=\\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k}$$ Indeed, note that for $1\\leq k\\leq n$ we have $$k\\binom{n}{k}=k\\cdot\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=n\\cdot\\frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!\\bigl((n-1)-(k-1)\\bigr)!}=n\\binom{n-1}{k-1},\\tag{4}$$ and so $$\\begin{align}n2^{n-1} &\\overset{(2)}{=} n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\binom{n-1}{k}\\\\ &= n\\sum_{k=1}^n\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\\\ &= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}n\\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\\\ &\\overset{(4)}{=} \\sum_{k=1}^nk\\binom{n}{k}\\\\ &= \\sum_{k=0}^nk\\binom{n}{k},\\end{align}$$ as desired.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is to prove by induction that the sum of k squared times the binomial coefficient from k=0 to n equals n(n+1)2^{n-2}. Alright, induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start with the base case.\n\nFirst, check for n=0. The left side would be 0^2 * C(0,0) which is 0. The right side is 0*(0+1)*2^{-2} which is 0*1*(1/4)=0. So that works. Hmm, but maybe they want to start at n=1? Let's see. For n=1: left side is 0^2*C(1,0) + 1^2*C(1,1) = 0 + 1 =1. Right side is 1*(1+1)*2^{-1} =2*(1/2)=1. Okay, so that works too. So base case holds for n=0 and n=1.\n\nNow, the inductive step. Assume that the formula holds for some integer n=m. That is, sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k) k^2 = m(m+1)2^{m-2}. Then we need to show it holds for n=m+1. So consider the sum for n=m+1. Let's write that out: sum_{k=0}^{m+1} C(m+1,k)k^2. Hmm, how can I relate this to the inductive hypothesis?\n\nI know that C(m+1,k) = C(m,k) + C(m,k-1). Maybe split the sum into two parts using this identity. So sum_{k=0}^{m+1} [C(m,k) + C(m,k-1)]k^2. Then split the sum into two sums: sum_{k=0}^{m+1} C(m,k)k^2 + sum_{k=0}^{m+1} C(m,k-1)k^2. But notice that in the first sum, when k=m+1, C(m,m+1)=0, so the upper limit can be m. Similarly, the second sum, when k=0, C(m,-1)=0, so the lower limit becomes k=1. So we have sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k)k^2 + sum_{k=1}^{m+1} C(m,k-1)k^2.\n\nLet’s reindex the second sum. Let j = k-1. Then when k=1, j=0; when k=m+1, j=m. So the second sum becomes sum_{j=0}^m C(m,j)(j+1)^2. Therefore, combining both sums, the total expression is sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k)k^2 + sum_{j=0}^m C(m,j)(j+1)^2. Let's rename j back to k for clarity: sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k)[k^2 + (k+1)^2]. \n\nExpanding (k+1)^2 gives k^2 + 2k +1. So the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k)[k^2 + k^2 + 2k +1] = sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k)(2k^2 + 2k +1). Hmm, breaking this down into separate sums: 2 sum C(m,k)k^2 + 2 sum C(m,k)k + sum C(m,k)1. \n\nBy the inductive hypothesis, sum C(m,k)k^2 = m(m+1)2^{m-2}. Also, we know that sum C(m,k)k = m2^{m-1} (since it's the expected value of a binomial distribution with p=1/2, multiplied by 2^m). And sum C(m,k) = 2^m. So substituting these in: 2[m(m+1)2^{m-2}] + 2[m2^{m-1}] + 2^m. \n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2 * m(m+1)2^{m-2} = m(m+1)2^{m-1}\n\nSecond term: 2 * m2^{m-1} = m2^{m}\n\nThird term: 2^m\n\nAdding them together: m(m+1)2^{m-1} + m2^{m} + 2^m. Factor out 2^{m-1} from the first two terms: 2^{m-1}[m(m+1) + 2m] + 2^m. Simplify inside the brackets: m(m+1) + 2m = m^2 + m + 2m = m^2 +3m. So now it's 2^{m-1}(m^2 +3m) +2^m. \n\nNote that 2^m = 2*2^{m-1}, so we can factor out 2^{m-1}: 2^{m-1}(m^2 +3m +2). The quadratic factors: m^2 +3m +2 = (m+1)(m+2). Thus, the total becomes 2^{m-1}(m+1)(m+2).\n\nBut we need this to equal (m+1)(m+2)2^{(m+1)-2} = (m+1)(m+2)2^{m-1}, which matches! Therefore, the inductive step holds. Thus, by mathematical induction, the formula is valid for all non-negative integers n.\n\nWait, but did I make any mistake here? Let me check the algebra again. When adding the terms:\n\nFirst term after substitution: m(m+1)2^{m-1}\n\nSecond term: m2^{m}\n\nThird term: 2^m\n\nSo adding them:\n\nm(m+1)2^{m-1} + m2^{m} +2^m = m(m+1)2^{m-1} + m2^{m} +2^m\n\nNote that 2^{m} = 2*2^{m-1}, so:\n\n= m(m+1)2^{m-1} + m*2*2^{m-1} +2*2^{m-1}\n\nFactor out 2^{m-1}:\n\n= 2^{m-1}[m(m+1) + 2m +2]\n\n= 2^{m-1}[m^2 +m +2m +2]\n\n= 2^{m-1}[m^2 +3m +2]\n\nWhich factors into (m+1)(m+2)2^{m-1}, and since the right-hand side for n=m+1 is (m+1)( (m+1)+1 )2^{(m+1)-2} = (m+1)(m+2)2^{m-1}, which matches. So yes, the inductive step is correct.\n\nTherefore, the proof by induction works. The key steps were using the binomial coefficient identity to split C(m+1,k) into C(m,k) + C(m,k-1), reindexing the second sum, expanding, and then using known sums for binomial coefficients with k^2, k, and 1. Then simplifying the resulting expression to match the desired formula for n=m+1.",
