    "Content": "I have been thinking on and off about a problem for some time now. It is inspired by an exam problem which I solved but I wanted to find an alternative solution. The object was to prove that some sequence of functions converges weakly to zero in $L^2$. I managed to show (with some help) that the limit $f$ (of a subsequence) satisfies $\\int_0^x f \\ dm=0$ for all $x>0 $. From this I want to conclude that $f=0$ a.e. I can do this with the fundamental theorem of calculus in its Lebesgue version but there ought to be a more elementary proof. Can someone here help me out?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Indeed, as you expected, a simple proof of the result can be found; see Theorem 2.1 in this useful note on absolutely continuous functions. EDIT : Since this is a quite important result, it is worth giving here the proof in detail. The proof below is essentially the one given in the link above, but somewhat shorter. Theorem . If $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$ and $\\int_a^x {f(t) dt}  = 0$ $\\forall x \\in [a,b]$ , then $f = 0$ a.e. on $[a, b]$ . Proof. An open subset $O$ of $[a,b]$ is a countable union of disjoint open intervals $(c_n, d_n)$ ; hence, $$ \\int_O {f(t) dt}  = \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty  {\\int_{c_n }^{d_n } {f(t) dt} }  = 0 $$ . If $K$ is a closed subset of $[a,b]$ , then $$ \\int_K {f(t) dt}  = \\int_a^b f(t)dt - \\int_{(a, b) \\setminus K} f(t)dt = 0 - 0 = 0, $$ since $ (a, b) \\setminus K $ is open. Next let $E_ +   = \\{ x \\in [a,b]:f(x) > 0\\}$ and $E_ -   = \\{ x \\in [a,b]:f(x) < 0\\}$ . If $\\lambda(E_+) > 0$ , then there exists some closed set $K \\subset E_+$ such that $\\lambda(K) > 0$ . But $\\int_K {f(t){\\rm d}t}  = 0$ , hence $f=0$ a.e. on $K$ . This contradiction shows that $\\lambda(E_+) = 0$ . Similarly, $\\lambda(E_-) = 0$ . The theorem is thus established.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question.\n\nThe original question is about proving that if the integral of a function f from 0 to x is zero for all x > 0, then f is zero almost everywhere. The user mentions that they were inspired by an exam problem and want an alternative to using the Lebesgue version of the fundamental theorem of calculus.\n\nSo, the main assumptions here are:\n1. f is a function in L² (since the problem is in the context of weak convergence in L²).\n2. The integral of f from 0 to x is zero for every x > 0.\n3. The conclusion is that f must be zero almost everywhere.\n\nWait, the problem statement as given in the question is: If ∫₀ˣ f dm is zero everywhere, then f is zero almost everywhere. The user mentions that they have a function f which is the limit of a subsequence in L², and they showed that its integral from 0 to x is zero for all x > 0. So the key assumptions here are about f being in L² and the integral condition. However, in the problem as posed, the main assumptions are the integral condition and that f is measurable (since we're talking about almost everywhere). But the user's specific case has f in L², which implies measurability and square integrability. However, the problem as stated might not require f to be in L² necessarily; it might hold for integrable functions. But the original exam problem is in L² context.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, we need to extract the assumptions directly from the problem statement. The user's question is general: If ∫₀ˣ f dm = 0 for all x > 0, then f = 0 a.e. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- f is a measurable function (since we're talking about almost everywhere)\n- For every x > 0, the integral of f from 0 to x is zero.\n\nBut the problem might not explicitly state that f is integrable on [0, x] for each x > 0, but that is required for the integral to make sense. So we should include that as an assumption.\n\nBreaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. f is a measurable function.\n2. For every x > 0, the integral ∫₀ˣ f(t) dm(t) = 0.\n3. The measure m is Lebesgue measure.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"dm\" which is Lebesgue measure. So maybe we need to specify that.\n\nBut in the user's example, they included assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nSo for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a Lebesgue measurable function.\n- For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n- The integral is with respect to Lebesgue measure.\n\nBut maybe \"f is integrable on [0, x] for every x > 0\" is also needed, because otherwise the integral might not be defined. So perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. f is a Lebesgue measurable function.\n2. For every x > 0, f is integrable on [0, x].\n3. For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f = 0 almost everywhere.\n\nAlternatively, in the problem statement as given by the user, they mention that f is in L². But the general problem they are posing (from the title) doesn't specify L². The exam problem might have been in L², but the general question is broader. However, the user wants to structure the problem from the original question, which is the title: \"If ∫₀ˣ f dm is zero everywhere then f is zero almost everywhere.\"\n\nSo the problem as stated in the title assumes that f is such that the integral is zero for all x, and the conclusion is f=0 a.e. The necessary assumptions would be that f is Lebesgue integrable on each interval [0,x], and the integral is zero. So structuring that, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0, x] for every x > 0,\nFor every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f = 0 almost everywhere.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption listed was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a single condition on one object. So here, each assumption should be a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is Lebesgue integrable on [0, x] for every x > 0,\n- For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove that f = 0 almost everywhere.\n\nAlternatively, the first assumption could be split into two parts if necessary, but here, \"Lebesgue integrable on [0,x] for every x >0\" is a single condition applied to f.\n\nBut perhaps even more precise: \"f is a measurable function\" is another assumption, because integrable implies measurable. Wait, in Lebesgue integration, a function is integrable only if it's measurable. So if f is integrable on [0,x] for every x>0, then f is measurable on each [0,x], hence measurable on [0, ∞). So maybe the first assumption is that f is measurable and integrable on each [0,x]. But maybe the user's problem assumes that f is in L², but the title doesn't specify that.\n\nLooking back at the original question:\n\nTitle: If ∫₀ˣ f dm is zero everywhere then f is zero almost everywhere\n\nQuestion body: They mention that f is the limit in L² of a subsequence, and they have ∫₀ˣ f dm = 0 for all x>0. They want to conclude f=0 a.e. without using the fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals.\n\nBut the structured problem should be based on the title and the core problem, not the specific context of the exam problem. The user is asking about the general case. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function for which ∫₀ˣ f dm = 0 for all x > 0.\n2. f is such that these integrals are defined, i.e., f is integrable on each [0, x].\n\nBut to list the assumptions as per the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- f is a Lebesgue integrable function on [0, x] for every x > 0,\n- For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is zero almost everywhere.\n\nAlternatively, if \"f is measurable\" is considered a separate assumption, but in the context of Lebesgue integrable, measurability is part of the definition. So perhaps the first assumption is redundant. But to be explicit, maybe:\n\n- f is a measurable function,\n- For every x > 0, f is integrable on [0, x],\n- For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nBut the original problem's title doesn't specify that f is measurable or integrable, but in reality, the integral ∫₀ˣ f dm is only defined if f is measurable and integrable. So those are implicit assumptions. But to structure the problem, we need to make them explicit as per the problem's requirements.\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer, which was part of the problem's original statement. Similarly, here, the problem's title states the integral condition, but the user's question in the body mentions f being in L². However, the core problem is as per the title.\n\nSo, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a Lebesgue integrable function on [0, x] for every x > 0,\nFor every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f is zero almost everywhere.\n\nBut each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function such that for every x > 0, f is Lebesgue integrable on [0, x],\nFor every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f = 0 almost everywhere.\n\nAlternatively, split the first assumption into \"f is a measurable function\" and \"for every x > 0, f is integrable on [0, x]\". But since integrable implies measurable, maybe it's redundant. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though divisibility by 7 implies being an integer. Wait, no. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and then the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, the example seems to have a discrepancy. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption adds that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. So perhaps the user in the example was modifying the problem, perhaps to a specific case. So maybe the example is showing how to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with specific assumptions. Therefore, in the current problem, we need to read the original question and filter out unrelated info.\n\nThe original question on Math SE is titled: \"If ∫₀ˣ f dm is zero everywhere then f is zero almost everywhere\".\n\nThe body mentions that the user wants to prove that f=0 a.e. given that ∫₀ˣ f dm =0 for all x>0, without using the fundamental theorem of calculus for Lebesgue integrals. The context is that f is the weak limit in L² of a sequence, hence f is in L². But the general problem in the title doesn't specify f being in L².\n\nSo to structure the problem as per the title, the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a function such that for every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0 (where the integral is Lebesgue).\n2. f is Lebesgue integrable on each interval [0, x].\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is Lebesgue integrable on [0, x] for every x > 0,\nFor every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f = 0 almost everywhere.\n\nBut to adhere to the example's structure, where each assumption is a single line, even if they are related. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Similarly, here, even if integrable on [0,x] for every x>0 implies measurability, but maybe the user wants to list \"f is measurable\" as an assumption. However, in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 13*7, so if n is divisible by 7, then 5^n and 6^n terms would have factors related to 7 and 13. But perhaps the example was a different problem. Maybe the user provided an example where they restructured the problem with added assumptions. But in any case, following the instructions: filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question's assumptions are that ∫₀ˣ f dm =0 for all x>0, and f is such that the integrals exist (i.e., f is integrable on each [0,x]). So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a Lebesgue integrable function on [0, x] for every x > 0.\n2. For every x > 0, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt = 0.\n\nThe problem is to prove f=0 a.e.\n\nEach assumption is a single line addressing one property of f.",
