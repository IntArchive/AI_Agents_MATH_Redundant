    "Content": "My only exposure to proofs was in a math logic class I took in University. I was wondering if my attempt at proving that $\\sqrt{12}$ is irrational is OK. $$\\Big(\\frac{m}{n}\\Big)^2 = 12$$\n$$\\Big(\\frac{m}{2n}\\Big)^2 = 3$$\n$$m^2=3*(2n)^2$$ This implies $m$ is even and so $n$ must be odd. The problem can be reduced to: $$\\Big(\\frac{p}{n}\\Big)^2 = 3$$ Because $n$ is odd, $p^2$ is odd, so $p$ is odd. This implies:\n$$4a+1 = 3(4b+1)$$\n$$4a - 12b = 2$$\n$$2a - 6b = 1$$ I'm kind of stuck at this point. I know that this can't be true but I don't know how to state it. Any critiques or suggestions? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You made it too complicated in my opinion. First we show that a rational number (different from $0$ ) times an irrational is irrational. Proof by contradiction:\nLet $x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Q}$ , $a,c\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ , $b,d\\in \\mathbb{N}, d \\neq 0$ . $$x\\cdot \\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{c}{d} \\iff x=\\frac{bc}{ad},$$ so $x$ would be rational. Use $$\\sqrt{12}=\\sqrt{4\\cdot 3} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$$ So $\\sqrt{12}$ irrational $\\iff \\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. Now, we show $3|p^2 \\implies 3|p$ : We know 3 is prime so with Euclid's lemma we have $$3|p^2 \\implies 3|p \\lor 3|p \\implies 3|p$$ To prove that $\\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, you derive a contradiction: $$\\sqrt{3}=\\frac{p}{q}\\iff 3q^2=p^2 \\implies \\exists k \\in \\mathbb{N}: 3k =p$$ $$q^2=3k^2$$ So $q$ and $p$ both have the divisor $3$ . Now there are two different ways to use this information. The first proceeds by contradiction, assuming that $p$ and $q$ don't have a common divisor, but as you can show they always have the divisor $3$ , you can't write $\\sqrt{3}$ as a fraction of numbers without common divisors. This is the more elegant way in my opinion.\nThe other way is to show that both $p$ and $q$ can't be finite, because\nby repeating this argument we see $3^n|p$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and similarly for $q$ . But because of $p,q\\in \\mathbb{N}$ , $3^n> 1+2n$ and the Archimedean principle we get a contradiction.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that sqrt(12) is irrational. The user attempted a proof by contradiction, assuming sqrt(12) is rational, expressed as m/n in lowest terms. Then they manipulated the equation step by step, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNow, I have to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. sqrt(12) is rational, which can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers.\n2. The fraction m/n is in its lowest terms, so m and n have no common divisors other than 1.\n3. From the equation (m/n)^2 = 12, they derived m^2 = 12n^2, then m^2 = 3*(2n)^2. This suggests m is divisible by 2, so m is even. Therefore, m can be written as 2p, leading to (2p)^2 = 12n^2 → 4p^2 = 12n^2 → p^2 = 3n^2. Here, the user states that n must be odd because if n were even, m and n would share a common factor of 2, contradicting the lowest terms assumption. So another assumption is that n is odd.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the user wrote \"This implies m is even and so n must be odd.\" So n being odd is an assumption based on m being even and the fraction being reduced. So the assumptions here are:\n\n- sqrt(12) is rational, expressed as m/n in lowest terms.\n- m and n are integers with no common factors.\n- m is even.\n- n is odd.\n\nBut each assumption must be listed line by line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nsqrt(12) can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers,\nm and n have no common divisors other than 1,\nm is even,\nn is odd.\n\nThen the problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, which the user gets stuck at the equation 2a - 6b = 1. But the original problem is to critique the proof showing sqrt(12) is irrational. However, in the example given, the problem was restated as \"Prove that ... is divisible by 91.\" Here, the user is asking for critiques on their proof, but according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should be the actual mathematical problem, not the request for critique. Wait, looking back at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem was that. So in this case, the problem is \"Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational.\" The user's question includes their attempted proof and asks for critiques, but the structured problem should be the original problem, not the request for critique.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had some extra conditions. Wait, let me check again. The example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like the user might have made a mistake, but maybe the example is correct. Wait, maybe the original problem was actually different? Let me check.\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, I have to follow their format. So in their example, they took the original problem, which was to prove for every integer n, and then in the assumptions, they added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the correct problem was for n divisible by 7. But regardless, the user's example is like that, so I need to follow how they structured it.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original question is about proving sqrt(12) is irrational. The user attempted a proof by contradiction, assuming sqrt(12) = m/n reduced, leading to m even and n odd, then deriving a contradiction. So the problem to structure is the core mathematical problem: Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational. The assumptions would be those made in the proof attempt: m/n is in lowest terms, m is even, n is odd, etc.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the original problem had a different statement, but maybe it was a mistranslation. Alternatively, the user's example might be incorrect, but I have to follow it.\n\nWait, maybe the example is taking the problem which originally had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user rephrased it. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the divisibility by 91 holds for all integers n. However, the formatted problem's assumption includes n is divisible by 7. That seems conflicting. But perhaps the example is incorrect. However, I have to proceed based on the user's example.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user is trying to prove sqrt(12) is irrational. The key assumptions in their proof are:\n\n1. sqrt(12) is rational, so it can be written as m/n where m and n are coprime integers (no common factors).\n2. Squaring both sides gives (m/n)^2 = 12 => m^2 = 12n^2.\n3. From m^2 = 12n^2, they rewrite it as m^2 = 3*(2n)^2, implying m is divisible by 2 (since the RHS is divisible by 3 and 4). Therefore, m is even, so m = 2p.\n4. Substituting back, (2p)^2 = 12n^2 => 4p^2 = 12n^2 => p^2 = 3n^2. This implies that p^2 is divisible by 3, so p is divisible by 3, hence p = 3k.\n5. Then p^2 = 9k^2 = 3n^2 => 3k^2 = n^2, implying n is divisible by 3. But earlier, since m = 2p = 2*3k = 6k, so m is divisible by 6, and n is divisible by 3. This contradicts m and n being coprime.\n\nWait, but the user's attempt took a different path. The user's steps:\n\n(m/n)^2 = 12 → (m/(2n))^2 = 3 → m^2 = 3*(2n)^2. Then they say m is even, so n must be odd (since if n were even, m and n would share a factor of 2). Then they reduce to (p/n)^2 = 3 where p = m/2. Then since n is odd, p^2 is 3 times an odd number, so p must be odd. Then they write p as 2a+1 and n as 2b+1, leading to 4a^2 +4a +1 = 3(4b^2 +4b +1). Simplifying gives 4a^2 +4a +1 = 12b^2 +12b +3 → 4a^2 +4a = 12b^2 +12b +2 → 2a^2 +2a = 6b^2 +6b +1. Then 2(a^2 +a) = 2(3b^2 +3b) +1. The left side is even, the right is odd, contradiction.\n\nSo the user's approach is different from the standard proof. Their key assumptions are:\n\n- sqrt(12) = m/n in lowest terms.\n- m is even.\n- n is odd.\n- Then, through substitution, they reach an impossible equation.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. sqrt(12) can be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors.\n2. m is even.\n3. n is odd.\n\nThus, each of these should be listed line by line in the Assumption section. The problem is to show that this leads to a contradiction, thereby proving sqrt(12) is irrational. But according to the example, the Problem part is the original problem statement. So the original problem is \"Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions from the proof attempt (the ones leading to contradiction) and the problem is to prove the irrationality.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, but the formatted problem included additional assumptions. Hmm. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user provided it as their format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Maybe the original problem had a typo, and it was supposed to be for n divisible by 7. But regardless, I need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is about proving sqrt(12) is irrational, and their proof attempt makes certain assumptions. So following the example, perhaps the assumptions are those made in the proof attempt. However, in the example, the assumptions included conditions from the problem statement (n is integer, n divisible by 7), not from the proof steps. So maybe the assumptions in the formatted problem are the problem's conditions, not the proof's assumptions.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumptions list \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because the original problem's statement is for every integer n, so the assumption shouldn't include n divisible by 7 unless the problem was misstated. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow their approach.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is to prove sqrt(12) is irrational. The assumptions in the proof are that sqrt(12) is rational (i.e., can be written as m/n in lowest terms), m is even, and n is odd. But in the example, the assumptions were about the problem's variables. So perhaps in this case, the assumption is that sqrt(12) is rational, leading to the problem of showing a contradiction. But the example's assumptions were about the variable n in the problem.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The user's instruction says: \"Assumption: <All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object>\".\n\nSo in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The original problem stated \"for every integer n\". So the assumptions should include that n is an integer. But the example added \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example, but regardless, I need to proceed.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem is to prove sqrt(12) is irrational. The proof by contradiction assumes that sqrt(12) is rational, hence can be written as m/n in lowest terms. So the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- sqrt(12) is rational, i.e., sqrt(12) = m/n where m and n are integers.\n- m and n are coprime (no common factors).\n\nBut in the user's proof attempt, they derived that m is even and n is odd. So those are additional conditions derived from the initial assumptions. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the given conditions of the problem, not the derived ones. So perhaps the only assumption here is that sqrt(12) is rational, leading to the problem of finding a contradiction.\n\nBut the example included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So if the original problem is \"Prove that for every integer n...\", then \"n is an integer\" is a given condition. However, the formatted problem in the example added \"n is divisible by 7\", which may be part of the problem's actual conditions if there was a misstatement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's original problem was supposed to have \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but was written as \"for every integer n\". In that case, the formatted problem corrects it by listing the assumptions.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is correctly stated as proving sqrt(12) is irrational, so the assumption is that sqrt(12) is rational, leading to the problem of showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's proof attempt adds more specific assumptions (m even, n odd) derived from the initial assumption. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the problem's conditions. So perhaps the formatted problem's assumption should only include the main assumption: sqrt(12) is rational. But the example included multiple assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the correct way is to list all the necessary assumptions from the problem. For instance, if the problem is \"Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational,\" the assumption would be that it's rational, hence can be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- sqrt(12) = m/n where m and n are integers,\n- m and n have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nBut the user's proof attempt goes further to derive that m is even and n is odd. However, those are not assumptions of the problem but consequences derived within the proof. Therefore, they should not be listed as assumptions in the formatted problem.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem's statement was for every integer n, so adding \"n is divisible by 7\" is incorrect. This suggests that the example might be flawed. Therefore, perhaps the user's intended format is to list all the conditions needed for the problem, even if some are derived or part of the proof.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's proof attempt starts with assuming sqrt(12) is rational, expressed as m/n in lowest terms. Then they manipulate the equation to find that m must be even, leading to n being odd. Then they substitute back and reach a contradiction. Therefore, the key assumptions made in the proof are:\n\n1. sqrt(12) is rational, i.e., sqrt(12) = m/n with m, n integers.\n2. m and n are coprime (no common factors).\n3. From m^2 = 12n^2, m is even.\n4. Hence, n must be odd (since if n were even, m and n would share a factor of 2).\n\nBut these are steps in the proof, not assumptions of the problem. The only actual assumption for the problem is that sqrt(12) is rational. The rest are derived conditions. However, according to the example, assumptions can include derived conditions. For example, in the example, the problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem included n is divisible by 7, which is not part of the original problem's statement but perhaps a derived condition.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user wants all conditions used in the proof to be listed as assumptions, even if they are derived. In that case, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- sqrt(12) can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are integers,\n- m and n have no common divisors other than 1,\n- m is even,\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational.\n\nBut does this make sense? The problem is to prove sqrt(12) is irrational, and the assumptions are the steps taken in the proof by contradiction. However, traditionally, the only assumption needed is that sqrt(12) is rational (i.e., expressed as a reduced fraction). The rest are derived from that assumption.\n\nBut following the user's example, which included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", perhaps the formatted problem should list all conditions used in the proof, including the derived ones. Therefore, in this case, the assumptions would include that m is even and n is odd, derived from the initial assumption.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure. The example might be incorrect, but I have to proceed as per the user's example. Given that in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original problem, perhaps the user expects to extract all conditions used in the proof, even if they are derived.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- sqrt(12) can be written as m/n where m and n are integers,\n- m and n are coprime (no common divisors),\n- m is even,\n- n is odd.\n\nProblem: Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational.\n\nBut the problem is already to prove that, so perhaps this is redundant. Alternatively, the problem in the formatted version should be the specific step where the user is stuck, which is reaching the contradiction from 2a -6b =1. But according to the example, the problem is the original question.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. To align with the example, where the original problem was restated in the formatted problem with additional assumptions, perhaps the formatted problem here would list the assumptions made in the proof (rationality, reduced fraction, m even, n odd) and the problem is to show the contradiction.\n\nBut the user's question is asking for help with their proof attempt, which gets stuck at the equation 2a -6b =1. However, according to the format provided, the \"Problem\" part should be the mathematical problem to solve, not the step where they are stuck. Therefore, the Problem should be \"Prove that sqrt(12) is irrational.\"\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have assumptions as the initial conditions used in the proof (sqrt(12) is rational, expressed as reduced fraction, m even, n odd), and the problem is to prove sqrt(12) is irrational.\n\nBut this seems a bit off because the assumptions are part of the proof by contradiction, not the problem's statement. However, following the example, which included derived conditions as assumptions, I think this is the way to go.\n\nSo, final answer:\n\nAssumption:\nsqrt(12) can be expressed as m/n where m and n are integers,\nm and n have no common divisors other than 1,\nm is even,\nn is odd.\n\nProblem:\nProve that sqrt(12) is irrational.",
