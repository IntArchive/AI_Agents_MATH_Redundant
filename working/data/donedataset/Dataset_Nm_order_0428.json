    "Content": "I discovered the following conjecture by evaluating the integral numerically and then using some inverse symbolic calculation methods to find a possible closed form:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}dx\\stackrel{\\color{#808080}?}=\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\,\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}.\\tag1$$\nThe equality holds numerically with a precision of at least $1000$ decimal digits. But so far I was not able to find a proof of it. Because the integral can be represented as a derivative of a hypergeometic function with respect to its parameter, the conjecture can be rewritten as\n$$\\frac{d}{da}{_2F_1}\\left(a,\\ \\tfrac12;\\ 1;\\ \\tfrac12\\right)\\Bigg|_{a=\\frac12}\\stackrel{\\color{#808080}?}=\\frac{\\sqrt\\pi\\,\\ln2}{2\\,\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}\\tag2$$\nor, using a series expansion of the hypergeometric function, as\n$${\\large\\sum}_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{H_{n-\\frac12}\\ \\Gamma^2\\left(n+\\tfrac12\\right)}{2^n\\ \\Gamma^2\\left(n+1\\right)}\\stackrel{\\color{#808080}?}=-\\frac{3\\,\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2\\,\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}\\tag3,$$\nwhere $H_q$ is the generalized harmonic number , $H_q=\\gamma+\\psi_0\\left(q+1\\right).$ Could you suggest any ideas how to prove this?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is trying to prove an integral equality that they discovered numerically. The integral is from 0 to infinity of (ln x)/(sqrt(x) * sqrt(x+1) * sqrt(2x+1)) dx, which they conjecture equals a specific expression involving pi, ln 2, and the gamma function. \n\nNow, the assumptions: The problem mentions integrating from 0 to infinity, so the integral is over positive real numbers. The integrand involves ln x divided by three square roots. The integrand's terms are sqrt(x), sqrt(x+1), and sqrt(2x+1). Each of these terms is defined for x ≥ 0, except sqrt(x) which is defined for x > 0, but since the integral starts at 0, we need to check behavior near 0. However, the user didn't specify any particular conditions or constraints beyond the integral itself. The problem is a conjecture, so the main assumption is the equality proposed. But according to the example, assumptions are about the problem's conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the user restructured it to list n as integer and n divisible by 7 as separate assumptions. Here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so perhaps the assumption is that x is a positive real number (since the integral is from 0 to ∞). Also, the integrand's components must be defined, so each square root must be real and non-negative, which they are for x ≥ 0. But sqrt(x) is in the denominator, so x cannot be zero, but the integral starts at 0, so maybe the assumption is that the integral converges, but the problem is to prove the equality, so perhaps the convergence is part of what needs to be proven. However, the user mentions they evaluated it numerically, so maybe the assumption is that the integral exists. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup. Wait, the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem had assumptions: n is integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should be that n is an integer. However, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem actually requires that n is divisible by both 7 and 13? Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But in the problem given here, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so perhaps the assumption is that x is in [0, ∞). But the integrand has ln x, which is defined for x > 0, so maybe x is in (0, ∞). But the problem is stated as an integral from 0 to ∞, so perhaps the assumption is that the integral converges. However, the user might not state that, as the problem is to prove the equality, which implies convergence. So maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- The integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (ln x)/(sqrt(x) * sqrt(x+1) * sqrt(2x+1)).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So for the integral problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a real number.\n- x > 0 (since sqrt(x) is in the denominator and ln x is defined for x > 0).\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem doesn't need to list all these, as the integral's limits and integrand define the domain. However, in the example, assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is to compute the integral, so perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, but the user's conjecture is that it equals the given expression. But in the example, the assumption included conditions on n. Wait, the example's original problem was \"for every integer n\", which was translated into an assumption that n is an integer, but also added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their format.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that the integral equals the given expression. The integral is defined as from 0 to ∞, and the integrand is as given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The variable x is integrated from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (ln x)/(sqrt(x) sqrt(x+1) sqrt(2x+1)).\n\nBut each assumption should be one property per line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞,\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integrand is (ln x)/[sqrt(x) sqrt(x+1) sqrt(2x+1)].\n\nBut maybe the original problem doesn't state these as assumptions because they are part of the integral's definition. However, according to the example, even obvious assumptions are listed. For instance, in the example, n being an integer was listed, even though the original problem states \"for every integer n\". So following that, here, the integral's domain and the variables' conditions should be listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's only assumption is the equality conjectured, but that's not the case. The problem is to prove the equality, so the assumptions are the conditions under which the integral is defined.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞.\n2. The variable x is positive (since ln x and sqrt(x) require x > 0).\n3. The integrand is (ln x)/(sqrt(x) sqrt(x+1) sqrt(2x+1)).\n\nBut perhaps the first two can be combined. Alternatively, each should be a separate line. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each is a separate line. So here, similarly:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over x from 0 to ∞,\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}\\).\n\nBut the original problem's title already states the integral, so perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's setup. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just as stated, and the assumptions are part of the problem's structure.\n\nWait, the example's formatted problem changed the original problem's statement. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but maybe the example had a mistake. However, I need to follow the user's example structure, even if it's flawed.\n\nBut in the given example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is integer, n divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91. That seems like a mistake because the original problem's conclusion is that it's divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. However, I need to follow their instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, there are no such additional conditions. The integral is from 0 to ∞, and the problem is to prove it equals that expression. So the assumptions are:\n\n- x is integrated from 0 to ∞,\n- x is positive,\n- The integrand is as given.\n\nBut maybe the user's example is different. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions required for the integral to converge. For example, the integrand's behavior at 0 and ∞ must be considered. Since ln x approaches -∞ as x approaches 0, and the denominator has sqrt(x), which approaches 0, but the integrand near 0 would behave like ln x / x^{1/2} ~ x^{-1/2} ln x, which integrates to a finite value since the integral of x^{-1/2} converges near 0, and ln x grows slower than any polynomial. Similarly, at infinity, the denominator behaves like x^{1/2} * x^{1/2} * (2x)^{1/2} } = x^{1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2} = x^{3/2}, so the integrand behaves like ln x / x^{3/2}, which decays fast enough for convergence. So the integral converges, but that's part of what needs to be proven or is assumed from the numerical result. However, the problem is to prove the equality, so perhaps the convergence is assumed. Therefore, the assumptions would include that the integral converges.\n\nBut the example didn't include convergence assumptions, so perhaps it's not needed here. Given that, the main assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over x from 0 to ∞,\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that the integral equals \\(\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}\\).\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption as one line. So each bullet point is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that  \n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}dx$$  \nequals  \n$$\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}.$$\n\nBut in the original problem's title, the integral is written with more spaces using \\ \\. So to match that, the LaTeX should have \\ \\ between the square roots. Also, check if the original problem's integral has any other formatting. Yes, in the original problem, it's written as:\n\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}dx$$\n\nWait, the user included \\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}, which is to adjust the vertical spacing, but maybe we can ignore that for simplicity, or include it as in the original. However, since the task is to structure the problem, it's better to copy the integral as given. Looking back:\n\nOriginal problem's integral:\n\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}dx\\stackrel?=\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}$$\n\nSo the integrand is written with \\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}} which is likely to adjust the vertical alignment, but for the purposes of the problem, it's just sqrt(x). So perhaps we can include it as is.\n\nTherefore, the integrand is:\n\n\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}\n\nBut in LaTeX, the backslash is used, so in the formatted problem, it should be written correctly.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a positive real number,\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to ∞,\nThe integrand is \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}\\).\n\nProblem: Prove that  \n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln x}{\\sqrt{x\\vphantom{1}}\\ \\sqrt{x+1}\\ \\sqrt{2x+1}}dx$$  \nequals  \n$$\\frac{\\pi^{3/2}\\,\\ln2}{2^{3/2}\\Gamma^2\\left(\\tfrac34\\right)}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user has the integral equal to the expression with a question mark over the equality, but in the formatted problem, we just state the problem to prove the equality, so we can omit the question mark.\n\nSo the final formatted problem should be:",
