    "AcceptedAnswer": "In general $$F(\\alpha) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi \\alpha)}{n^3}$$ converges and can be explicitly calculated when $\\alpha$ is a quadratic irrational . The convergence in this case is easily seen as $\\alpha$ has irrationality measure $2$ . More precisely, $F(\\alpha)/\\pi^3 \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$ when $\\alpha$ is quadratic irrational. The procedure below also works when $n^3$ is replaced by any $n^{2k+1}$ . Let $$g(z) = \\frac{\\cot(z\\pi \\alpha)\\cot(z\\pi)}{z^3}$$ then $g$ has simple poles at non-zero integer multiples of $1$ and $1/\\alpha$ , and $5$ -th order pole at $0$ . Let $R_N$ denote a large rectangle with corners at $N(\\pm 1 \\pm i)$ . Then contour integration gives $$\\tag{1}\\sum_{\\substack{n\\in R_N \\\\ n\\neq 0}} \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi\\alpha)}{\\pi n^3} + \\sum_{\\substack{n/\\alpha\\in R_N \\\\ n\\neq 0}} \\frac{\\alpha^2\\cot(n\\pi/\\alpha)}{\\pi n^3}-\\frac{\\pi ^2 \\left(\\alpha^4-5 \\alpha^2+1\\right)}{45 \\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{R_N} g(z)dz$$ I claim there exists a sequence of integers $N_1, N_2, \\cdots$ such that RHS tends to $0$ . Note that $\\cot(z\\pi)$ is uniformly bounded on the annulus $R_{N+3/4} - R_{N+1/4}$ when $N$ is an integer. Hence by equidistribution of $n\\alpha$ modulo $1$ , we can find integers $N_i$ such that both $\\cot(z\\pi\\alpha)$ and $\\cot(z\\pi)$ are uniformly bounded on $R_{N_i+3/4} - R_{N_i+1/4}$ . Since we already know the series converges, from $(1)$ : $$\\tag{2}F(\\alpha) + \\alpha^2F(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}) = \\underbrace{\\frac{\\pi ^3 \\left(\\alpha^4-5 \\alpha^2+1\\right)}{90 \\alpha}}_{\\rho(\\alpha)}$$ Note that obviously $F(\\alpha+1)=F(\\alpha)$ . Let the continued fraction expansion of $\\alpha$ be given by $$\\alpha = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\cdots]$$ Successive complete quotients are denoted by: $$\\zeta_0 = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\cdots]\\qquad \\zeta_1 = [a_1;a_2,a_3,\\cdots]\\qquad \\zeta_2 = [a_2;a_3,a_4,\\cdots]$$ Then $(2)$ and periodicity implies for $k\\geq 0$ : $$\\tag{3} F(\\zeta_{k+1}) + \\zeta_{k+1}^2 F(\\zeta_k) = \\rho(\\zeta_{k+1})$$ If continued fraction of $\\alpha$ is of form $$\\alpha = [a_0;a_1,\\cdots,a_m,\\overline{b_1,\\cdots,b_r}]$$ Then $\\zeta_{m+r+1} = \\zeta_{m+1}$ , so we eventually entered a cycle. $(3)$ gives a system of $m+r+1$ linear equations (by setting $k=0,\\cdots,m+r$ ), with $m+r+1$ variables: $F(\\zeta_0), F(\\zeta_1),\\cdots,F(\\zeta_{m+r})$ . $$\\begin{cases}\nF(\\zeta_1) + \\zeta_1^2 F(\\zeta_0) &= \\rho(\\zeta_1) \\\\ \nF(\\zeta_2) + \\zeta_2^2 F(\\zeta_1) &= \\rho(\\zeta_2) \\\\ \n\\cdots \\\\\nF(\\zeta_{m+1}) + \\zeta_{m+1}^2 F(\\zeta_{m+r}) &= \\rho(\\zeta_{m+1})\n\\end{cases}$$ Solving it gives the value of $F(\\zeta_0)=F(\\alpha)$ . A few examples: for $\\alpha = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ , the continued fraction has period $1$ , direct substitution into $(2)$ gives $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})}{n^3} = -\\frac{\\pi ^3}{45 \\sqrt{5}}$$ Complexity of result increases as period of $\\alpha$ increases. For $\\alpha = \\sqrt{211}$ , which has period $26$ : $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi \\sqrt{211})}{n^3} = \\frac{128833758679 \\pi ^3}{383254107060 \\sqrt{211}}$$ Another example: $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}))}{n^5} = \n\\frac{\\left(3882947003 \\sqrt{7}+14895286560\\right) \\pi ^5}{3344720117760}$$ The closed-form here follows immediately by noting $\\csc x = \\cot (x/2) - \\cot x$ . Inspired by a (now deleted) answer of Si-Qi Liu, I wrote the following Mathematica code to evaluate such sums efficiently. $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cot(n\\pi \\alpha)}{n^{2m+1}}$ means cotsum[alpha,m] . The command cotsum[Sqrt[61],1] evaluates the sum in the question. cotsum[a0_?QuadraticIrrationalQ, m_Integer] /; m >= 1 := \n  Block[{f, z, list, const, mat, resfunc, a}, \n   resfunc[aa_] := \n    Evaluate[Residue[Cot[z] Cot[aa z]/z^(2 m + 1), {z, 0}]]; \n   a = ToNumberField[a0]; f[aa_] := f[aa - Floor[aa]] /; aa > 1;\n   list = \n    DeleteDuplicates@\n     NestWhileList[1/# - Floor[1/#] &, a - Floor[a], UnsameQ, All];\n   {const, mat} = \n    CoefficientArrays[f[#] + #^(2 m) f[1/#] == resfunc[#] & /@ list, \n     f /@ list]; \n   Pi^(2 m + 1)/2*RootReduce[LinearSolve[mat, const][[1]]]];",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is: Prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of (cot(πn√61)/n³) equals -16793π³/(45660√61). The question itself repeats this series and mentions two parts: proving convergence and evaluating the series. The user already proved convergence using the irrationality measure argument, showing that the terms are bounded by C/n², hence the series converges absolutely. Now, the main task is to evaluate the series to get the specific value given.\n\nSo, following the example provided, I need to list all assumptions line by line. Each assumption should address one property or condition of one object. Let me parse through the problem.\n\nFirst, the series is from n=1 to infinity, so n are positive integers. The expression involves cot(πn√61). Since cotangent is periodic with period π, but here the argument is πn√61. The key point here might be that √61 is irrational, which is mentioned in the user's approach when they talk about the irrationality measure. The user's proof of convergence relies on the fact that √61 has a finite irrationality measure, which allows them to bound |sin(πn√61)| from below, leading to the terms being O(1/n²), hence convergent.\n\nTherefore, assumptions would include that √61 is irrational (to apply the irrationality measure), and perhaps that the irrationality measure of √61 is finite (which it is, since it's an algebraic number and by Roth's theorem, all algebraic numbers have irrationality measure 2). However, the problem might not explicitly state these, but they are necessary for the convergence proof. However, since the user already handled the convergence part, maybe the main problem is just evaluating the series, given that it converges.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Prove it converges and evaluate the series.\" But the user has already proved convergence and is asking for help on evaluation. However, the original problem's title and the question include both parts. So, when structuring the problem, do I include both parts or just the evaluation? The example given in the original query includes the problem statement as given, but the user might have filtered out parts. However, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, that was added as an assumption, even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, no, looking at the example: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, no, perhaps the example was mistyped. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". But wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe that example was incorrect? Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, maybe the user intended to show that even if the original problem states for all integers n, but the formatted problem requires an additional assumption? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is wrong. Because the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That would make the problem different. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original question is to prove convergence and evaluate the series. The user has already proved convergence, so the remaining part is evaluation. But the problem statement as per the title includes both. So when structuring the problem, do we include both parts or just the evaluation? The user's own attempt shows that they handled convergence and is asking about evaluation. So perhaps the problem is to evaluate the series given that it converges. But the original problem still requires both. However, the user wants to structure the problem as per the example. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like the formatted problem is changing the original problem. So perhaps the user wants to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated? But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe in the example, the user made an error. Alternatively, maybe the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is n is an integer. The formatted problem lists \"$n$ is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct, but then adds \"$n$ is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. So that seems incorrect. So perhaps the example is wrong. But maybe the user intended to show that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an extra assumption, perhaps mistakenly. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the task is to structure the problem given in the Math Stack Exchange question into the format: Assumptions and Problem. So the original problem is: Prove that the sum from n=1 to infinity of (cot(πn√61)/n³ equals -16793π³/(45660√61). The question mentions proving convergence and evaluating. The user has proved convergence and is asking how to evaluate.\n\nSo when structuring, the problem should include both parts? Or just the evaluation? The original problem says \"Prove it converges and evaluate the series.\" So both parts are part of the problem. However, in the user's formatted example, they included \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" even though the original problem had \"for every integer n\". So in the assumptions, they listed n is an integer. So similarly, here, the problem would be \"Prove that the sum converges and evaluate the series to equal ...\"\n\nBut for assumptions, what are the assumptions here? The problem states a specific series involving cot(πn√61). The key elements here are that √61 is irrational, which allows the convergence argument via irrationality measure. Also, that the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity. Additionally, perhaps the use of the specific constant √61, which is an algebraic number of degree 2, which may be necessary for certain number-theoretic arguments or for applying specific theorems related to quadratic irrationals.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n1. √61 is an irrational number.\n2. The irrationality measure of √61 is 2 (as per Roth's theorem, since it's algebraic).\n3. The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ |cot(πn√61)|/n³ converges.\nWait, but the user already proved convergence by showing the terms are O(1/n²). So perhaps the convergence is already established under certain assumptions. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking to both prove convergence and evaluate, but the user already did convergence. But in the problem structure, we need to state the problem as given, which includes both parts. Therefore, the assumptions would include that √61 is irrational, perhaps that the terms satisfy certain bounds (but the user's proof uses the irrationality measure to get the bound). So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- √61 is an irrational number with finite irrationality measure.\n- For each integer n ≥ 1, cot(πn√61) is defined (i.e., sin(πn√61) ≠ 0).\n\nBut wait, cotangent is defined when sine is non-zero. Since √61 is irrational, πn√61 is never an integer multiple of π, so sin(πn√61) ≠ 0. Therefore, cot(πn√61) is defined for all n ≥ 1. So maybe that's an assumption. However, it's automatically satisfied given √61 is irrational, so maybe redundant.\n\nAlternatively, the main assumptions are that √61 is irrational and has finite irrationality measure (which is true as it's algebraic). Therefore, these would be the necessary assumptions for the convergence proof. However, since the problem is to both prove convergence and evaluate, but the user already proved convergence, but the original problem still requires both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- √61 is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{n=1}^∞ (cot(πn√61))/n³ converges and evaluate it to equal -16793π³/(45660√61).\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions split into separate lines, each addressing one property. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number,\nThe irrationality measure of √61 is 2,\nFor all integers n ≥ 1, sin(πn√61) ≠ 0.\n\nBut the third assumption is redundant if we know √61 is irrational. Because if √61 were rational, say m/n, then n√61 = m, an integer, so sin(πn√61) = sin(πm) = 0. But since √61 is irrational, n√61 is never integer, so sin(πn√61) ≠ 0. Therefore, the third assumption is a consequence of the first. Therefore, maybe only the first two assumptions.\n\nBut the irrationality measure being 2 is a result from number theory (Roth's theorem), so maybe it's a known fact, not an assumption. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption needed is that √61 is irrational. Because the convergence proof relies on the irrationality measure, but if the problem is to be self-contained, maybe the assumption is that √61 has finite irrationality measure. However, since the problem is to prove convergence and evaluate, and the user already used the irrationality measure in their proof, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe irrationality measure of √61 is finite,\nFor each integer n ≥ 1, cot(πn√61) is defined.\n\nBut again, the second is redundant if the first is given. So perhaps just:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number with finite irrationality measure.\n\nBut in reality, we know that √61 is algebraic, hence its irrationality measure is 2. But the problem might not state this, so perhaps the problem assumes that √61 has finite irrationality measure, allowing the convergence proof.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not state any assumptions explicitly, so when structuring, we need to extract implicit assumptions. The problem is to prove convergence and evaluate the series. The convergence relies on the terms decaying sufficiently, which the user showed using the irrationality measure. Therefore, the key assumption is that √61 is irrational and has finite irrationality measure. However, in mathematical problems, sometimes such properties are taken for granted. For example, √61 is known to be irrational, and its irrationality measure is known to be 2. Therefore, maybe the only assumption is that √61 is irrational.\n\nBut to be precise, let me check the problem again. The original problem is to prove the equality. The user mentions that they proved convergence using the irrationality measure. Therefore, the problem implicitly assumes that √61 has the necessary properties (irrationality) to allow that convergence proof.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number,\nThe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (cot(πn√61))/n³ converges.\n\nBut the second assumption is part of the problem (to prove convergence). Wait, but in the example, the assumption was about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7), whereas the problem was to prove divisibility. So in the current case, the problem is to prove convergence and evaluate. Therefore, the assumptions should be the conditions given or necessary for the problem. However, the original problem does not explicitly state any assumptions; it's a direct question. Therefore, the only assumptions are those inherent in the problem, such as n being a positive integer (since the sum starts at n=1), and √61 being irrational. But since the problem is to prove convergence and evaluate, the assumptions might be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\n√61 is an irrational number.\n\nBut the first assumption is that n is a positive integer, which is given by the summation index. However, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which was part of the original problem's statement (\"for every integer n\"). So following that, the assumption here would be \"n is a positive integer\" because the series starts at n=1. However, n in the sum is a dummy variable, so maybe it's not necessary to state. Alternatively, since the problem involves the sum over n, the assumption is that n ranges over positive integers. But perhaps that's inherent in the sum notation.\n\nHowever, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But since the sum is from n=1 to infinity, that's already implied. Therefore, maybe the key assumption is that √61 is irrational. But the problem statement doesn't mention that; it's part of the mathematical context. Therefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include the implicit mathematical conditions necessary for the problem to make sense.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- √61 is an irrational number.\n- The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (cot(πn√61))/n³ converges.\n\nBut the second part is actually part of the problem to prove. So maybe the only assumption is that √61 is irrational, which allows the convergence proof. However, the problem asks to prove convergence, so the assumption shouldn't include that the series converges. Therefore, the assumptions are the conditions needed to formulate the problem, which are:\n\n- √61 is an irrational number.\n\nBut the problem is to prove convergence and evaluate. Therefore, the assumptions are the inherent conditions needed, which are that √61 is irrational (so that cot(πn√61) is defined for all n), and that n is a positive integer (as per the summation). But since n is the summation index, it's clear that n ranges over positive integers. Therefore, the main assumption is that √61 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require stating that √61 is irrational because it's a known fact. However, in the context of the problem, to apply the convergence proof via irrationality measure, the irrationality is necessary. Therefore, it's an assumption.\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cot(\\pi n\\sqrt{61})}{n^3}$$ converges and evaluate it to equal $$-\\frac{16793\\pi^3}{45660\\sqrt{61}}.$$\n\nBut the example in the user's instruction included multiple assumptions, each on one line, addressing one property. In this case, the only explicit assumption is that √61 is irrational. However, maybe we need to split into more assumptions, even if they are redundant. For instance, the convergence of the series could be another assumption, but since the problem asks to prove convergence, it's part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, considering the example again, where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n, and the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like the user in the example added an extra assumption not present in the original problem. That might be an error. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, the correct assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- √61 is an irrational number.\n\nBut n is a dummy variable in the summation, so it's not an external variable like in the example. Therefore, including \"n is a positive integer\" might not be necessary. Therefore, the main assumption is that √61 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove convergence and evaluate, and the user has already shown convergence using the irrationality measure argument, which requires that √61 has finite irrationality measure. Therefore, the assumptions might be:\n\n- √61 is an irrational number with finite irrationality measure.\n\nBut again, in mathematical problems, such properties are often taken as given for algebraic numbers. Since √61 is algebraic, its irrationality measure is 2 (finite), so this is a known fact. However, the problem might need to state this as an assumption if it's not common knowledge.\n\nBut given that the problem is from Math Stack Exchange, and the user is likely working within standard mathematical frameworks, the assumption would just be that √61 is irrational. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cot(\\pi n\\sqrt{61})}{n^3}$$ converges and evaluate it to $$-\\frac{16793\\pi^3}{45660\\sqrt{61}}.$$\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restated with the assumptions listed. Therefore, following that structure, I need to list each assumption line by line. Since the main necessary assumption here is the irrationality of √61, that's one line. However, the user's own convergence proof also relies on the irrationality measure being finite (which is true but perhaps not needed to state as an assumption if we can cite Roth's theorem). However, to be thorough, we can include both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into two assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number,\nThe irrationality measure of √61 is 2.\n\nBut since the second is a consequence of Roth's theorem, which states that all algebraic numbers have irrationality measure 2, and √61 is algebraic, maybe it's redundant. However, if the problem is intended to be self-contained, the user might need to assume the irrationality measure is finite. But in practice, mathematicians know this.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to list the key assumption that √61 is irrational, as that's the primary requirement for the convergence argument, and the rest (like irrationality measure) can be considered known results. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n√61 is an irrational number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{\\cot(\\pi n\\sqrt{61})}{n^3}$$ converges and evaluate it to $$-\\frac{16793\\pi^3}{45660\\sqrt{61}}.$$\n\nThis way, the main assumption needed for the problem is stated, and the problem includes both proving convergence and evaluating the series, as per the original question.",
