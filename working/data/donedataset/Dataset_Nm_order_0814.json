    "Content": "A few weeks ago I discovered and proved a simple identity for Euler's totient function.  I figured that someone would have already discovered it, but I haven't been able to find it anywhere. So I was hoping someone would be able to tell me whether or not they've seen this identity. Here it is: $$\\phi(n)=\\phi(\\operatorname{rad}(n))\\left(\\frac{n}{\\operatorname{rad}(n)}\\right)$$ where $\\operatorname{rad}(n)$ is the radical or square-free kernel of $n$, i.e. the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. I have omitted the proof because firstly, I'm still learning MathJax and am afraid it will take quite a long time to type out.  And secondly, I believe it is intuitive enough that most people familiar with the totient function should be able to see that it's true. Like I said, it is a pretty simple identity, but nevertheless; it seems like it could be fairly useful.  It would be a bit easier to calculate $\\phi(n)$ for large-ish $n$ with this identity, without the help of a program or totient function calculator. Ex: $$\\phi(450)=\\phi(2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2)=\\phi(2\\cdot3\\cdot5)\\left(\\frac{2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2}{2\\cdot3\\cdot5}\\right)=(1\\cdot2\\cdot4)(3\\cdot5)=120$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an interesting thing to notice, and you should be pleased. As you guessed, and as Steven Stadnicki pointed out, this is not new; it follows quickly from two important properties of the $\\phi$ function: $\\phi(p^n) = (p-1)p^{n-1}$ when $p$ is prime $\\phi(mn) = \\phi(m)\\phi(n)$ when $m$ and $n$ have no common factor In particular, you suggested that your formula might be useful for calculating $\\phi(n)$ for “large-ish $n$”, but observe that your formula requires knowing the radical of $n$, which is not in general any easier to find than the prime factorization of $n$.  (And when the radical of $n$ is equal to $n$, as it is when $n$ is squarefree, your formula is no help at all.) But given $n = p_1^{a_1}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ one has from (1) and (2) above that $$\\begin{align}\n\\phi(n) & = \\phi\\bigl(p_1^{a_1}\\bigr)\\cdots\\phi\\bigl(p_k^{a_k}\\bigr)  \\\\\n& = (p_1-1)p_1^{a_1-1}\\cdots (p_k-1)p_k^{a_k-1} \\\\\n& = \\frac{n}{p_1\\cdots p_k}(p_1-1)\\cdots(p_k-1) \\\\\n& = n\\left(\\frac{p_1-1}{p_1}\\right)\\cdots \\left(\\frac{p_k-1}{p_k}\\right) \\tag{$\\heartsuit$}\\\\\n& = n\\left(1-\\frac1{p_1}\\right)\\cdots\\left(1-\\frac1{p_k}\\right)\n\\end{align}$$ which is well-known, and not significantly harder to compute (or perhaps easier) than your formula.  The next-to last line ($\\heartsuit$) is very similar to your formula.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully. The user is talking about a new identity they discovered for Euler's Totient Function, which is φ(n) = φ(rad(n)) * (n / rad(n)). They mention that rad(n) is the radical of n, the product of distinct prime factors. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is about Euler's Totient Function, so the assumptions should relate to the properties of φ and rad(n). Let's see. The identity applies to any integer n where rad(n) is defined, which is for any positive integer n. However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, so the main assumption is that n is a positive integer. The identity involves the radical of n, so another assumption is that rad(n) is the product of the distinct prime factors of n. Also, the totient function φ is applied to both n and rad(n), which requires that both are positive integers.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the user uses n=450, which factors into 2, 3², 5². So rad(450) is 2*3*5=30. Then φ(450) is calculated as φ(30)*(450/30) = φ(30)*15. φ(30) is 8, so 8*15=120. So the identity seems to hold here. But are there any hidden assumptions? Like, does n need to be square-free? No, because 450 isn't square-free, but the identity still works. So the main assumption is that n is a positive integer, and rad(n) is its radical. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. rad(n) is the radical of n, i.e., the product of the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the user wants to present the identity and ask if it's new. The problem to structure is to verify or recognize this identity. However, according to the example given earlier, the assumption included specific conditions. But in this case, the identity is presented as a general formula. The original problem's assumptions would be inherent to the definitions used. So, perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- rad(n) is the radical of n (product of distinct prime factors).\n- φ is Euler's Totient Function.\n\nBut the problem itself is to present the identity and ask if it's known. However, the user's actual question is whether this identity has been seen before. But in the format provided, the \"problem\" part is the mathematical question to solve. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nIn the current case, the user's question is more about whether the identity is known, but the mathematical content is the identity itself. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the format. So the problem here would be the identity statement. Therefore, the problem part is to present the identity, and the assumptions are the conditions under which this identity holds. Since the identity is claimed to hold for all n (as in the example with n=450), the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer and rad(n) is defined as the radical. But perhaps the problem is to verify the identity, so the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the identity to hold, which would be n being a positive integer and rad(n) being its radical. But since the radical is always defined for any positive integer, maybe the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. However, the definition of rad(n) is part of the problem's context. Wait, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7. But in this case, there's no such restriction. The identity is general. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nrad(n) is the product of the distinct prime factors of n,\nφ is Euler's totient function.\n\nBut maybe the problem is to confirm the validity of the identity, so the assumptions are inherent. However, the way the example was structured, the assumptions included specific conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the identity is general for any positive integer n, so the assumptions are that n is a positive integer and rad(n) is its radical. But rad(n) is a standard function, so maybe the main assumption is just that n is a positive integer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions include the definition of rad(n), but the example didn't include definitions. Wait, in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a specific condition. The problem's original assumption didn't state that n is an integer, but the formatted version added it. So maybe here, the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer, and rad(n) is the radical of n. The problem is to prove or confirm the identity φ(n) = φ(rad(n)) * (n / rad(n)).\n\nBut the user's actual question is whether this identity is known, but the task is to structure the problem as per the format given. The example took the original problem's mathematical statement and extracted assumptions. So here, the problem is the identity itself, and the assumptions are the necessary conditions. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nrad(n) is the product of the distinct prime factors of n,\nφ is Euler's totient function.\n\nProblem:\nProve or confirm that $$\\phi(n)=\\phi(\\operatorname{rad}(n))\\left(\\frac{n}{\\operatorname{rad}(n)}\\right).$$\n\nBut wait, the example's assumptions included only two points: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. In this case, maybe the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer and rad(n) is its radical. Since φ is a standard function, maybe it's not necessary to list it as an assumption. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n divisible by 7. The user might have structured it that way because the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added that n is divisible by 7, perhaps as an error? Wait, the original example's formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which the formatted problem changed. Wait, that might be an error in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrectly formatted. Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to being divisible by 7. Unless there was a mistake in the example. That complicates things. Perhaps the user intended the example to have the assumption that n is an integer and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But if the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7, then the example's formatting is adding an extra assumption. That's confusing. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow that structure. In the current problem, the identity is presented as valid for any n, so the assumptions should include that n is a positive integer (since φ is defined for positive integers), and rad(n) is the radical. Therefore, the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer,\nrad(n) is the product of distinct prime factors of n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\phi(n)=\\phi(\\operatorname{rad}(n))\\left(\\frac{n}{\\operatorname{rad}(n)}\\right).$$\n\nBecause the original problem's question is whether this identity is known, but the task is to structure the mathematical problem. So the problem part is the identity to be proven. The assumptions are the necessary conditions. Since Euler's totient function is defined for positive integers, n must be a positive integer, and rad(n) is defined as the radical. Hence, the answer should list those assumptions.",
