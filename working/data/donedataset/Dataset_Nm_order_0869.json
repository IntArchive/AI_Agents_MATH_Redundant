    "Content": "In 1993 Strehl showed that\n$$\n\\sum_k\\binom nk^3=\\sum_k\\binom nk^2\\binom{2k}n.\n$$\nI’m interested in a combinatorial proof. Upd (Jan '14). Maybe the original question was too restrictive — I'm now asking for any proof. I've written a combinatorial proof (see answers), but it's somewhat convoluted. Maybe there is a nice proof using generating functions / residues (something like one for the Dixon's identity), for example?.. Comments and thoughts There is of course an algebraic proof (any such identity can be proved using WZ-magic of hypergeometric functions AFAIK). Feel free to post any proof, but I’m mainly interested in a combinatorial proof. It’s well known that $\\sum_k\\binom nk=2^n$ and $\\sum_k\\binom nk^2=\\binom{2n}n$.\nPerhaps, one should think about Stehl identity as the next member of this family.\n(Is there any analogue for degree 4, I wonder, btw?) Quadratic case suggests that it’s, perhaps, better to write LHS as $\\binom nk^2\\binom n{n-k}$. And maybe instead of one $n$ one should introduce two or three parameters (s.t. Strehl identity corresponds to n=m[=l]). A naive approach is $\\sum\\binom nk\\binom mk\\binom m{m-k}$ but looks like $\\sum\\binom nk\\binom mk\\binom n{m-k}$ might be a better choice — actually, it's equal to $\\sum\\binom nk\\binom mk\\binom{2k}m$. arXiv:0712.3946 might be of some relevance. There LHS is interpreted as the number of ways to deal a deck of 3n cards (n denominations, 3 colors) to 3 players so that no player receives a card of her own color. Let's write the identity in the form\n$$\n\\sum_{i+j=n}\\binom Bi\\binom Wj\\binom ni=\\sum_k\\binom Bk\\binom Wk\\binom{2k}n,\n$$\nwhere $B$ and $W$ are two $n$-element sets. What I want to say is that both sides count ways to choose an $n$-element subset of $B\\sqcup W$ with some kind of... extension (cf. two formulas for a trinomial coefficient , perhaps).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem formatting task. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and structure it into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"Strehl identity for the sum of cubes of binomial coefficients\". The main problem is about proving the identity ∑ₖ (n choose k)^3 = ∑ₖ (n choose k)^2 (2k choose n). The user mentions they're interested in a combinatorial proof but are open to any proof now. They also discuss some related ideas, like possible generalizations to higher degrees and references to other papers or combinatorial interpretations.\n\nBut the task is to filter out the unrelated information. The example given by the user includes only the core assumptions and the problem. The original example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the Strehl identity problem, there's no mention of divisibility conditions. Instead, the key elements are the binomial coefficients and the equality of the two sums.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the main equation is the focus. The assumptions here would probably relate to the variables involved. Since it's an identity for binomial coefficients, the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, and k is an integer such that the binomial coefficients are defined (i.e., 0 ≤ k ≤ n). However, in the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, maybe the key assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer, as binomial coefficients are typically defined for such n.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, there's no restriction on n other than it being an integer. However, binomial coefficients (n choose k) are usually defined for non-negative integers n and k. So perhaps the assumption is that n is a non-negative integer, and k ranges over integers where the binomial coefficients are non-zero. But the problem statement itself is an identity that should hold for all non-negative integers n. So the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, checking the example given by the user: in the original problem, the user wrote \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but in the example's formatted problem, the second assumption was actually part of the problem's original conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that might be an error. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they have assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Hmm, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", not requiring n to be divisible by 7. But maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in their example? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example shows that the formatted problem includes that as an assumption. Wait, let me check again. The example's original problem says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So this seems like an error in the example. Perhaps the original problem had a different condition, but maybe the example is incorrect. Regardless, the user provided that as their example, so maybe the task here is to follow the format even if the example has an inconsistency.\n\nBut moving forward, the current problem is about the Strehl identity. The problem is to prove that the sum of cubes of binomial coefficients equals the sum of squares of binomial coefficients times (2k choose n). The original question mentions that Strehl showed this in 1993, and the user is interested in a combinatorial proof but is open to any proof now.\n\nSo to format this correctly, under the Assumption section, we need to list all the assumptions. Since binomial coefficients (n choose k) are defined for non-negative integers n and k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the key assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. However, the problem statement is an identity that holds for all non-negative integers n. Therefore, the main assumption is that n is a non-negative integer. But in the example, the assumption was split into separate lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer,\nk is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about sums over k, so k is a dummy variable here. The problem statement doesn't impose any additional conditions on k beyond the standard binomial coefficient definition. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption needed is that n is a non-negative integer, as the sums over k are implicitly over all integers k where the binomial coefficients are non-zero. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require explicit assumptions because it's a general identity, but the format requires listing assumptions.\n\nIn the example provided, even though the problem was stated as \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in the original problem, there was a hidden assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the problem statement said \"for every integer n\". That's conflicting. But given that example, perhaps the user expects that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", we need to list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. But in the Strehl identity case, since it's an identity for binomial coefficients, the standard assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, for the Strehl identity problem, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBecause binomial coefficients (n choose k) are zero when k > n or k < 0, but the sums are over all k, so the non-negativity of n is the key assumption here.\n\nThe problem statement is then to prove the given identity. The original question mentions the identity as presented by Strehl, so the problem is to prove that ∑ₖ (n choose k)^3 equals ∑ₖ (n choose k)^2 (2k choose n).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nn is a non-negative integer.\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\n\\sum_k \\binom{n}{k}^3 = \\sum_k \\binom{n}{k}^2 \\binom{2k}{n}.\n$$\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nWait, but in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted version included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example might have had a mistake. However, in the Strehl identity problem, there's no such divisibility condition. The identity holds for all non-negative integers n. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nI need to make sure that the problem statement is correctly extracted. The original question's problem is to prove Strehl's identity: sum of cubes of binomial coefficients equals sum of squares times binomial(2k, n). The user also mentions combinatorial proofs and other thoughts, but those are extraneous. So the core problem is to prove that identity. Therefore, the formatted problem should state that, with the assumption that n is a non-negative integer.\n\nYes, that seems correct.",
