    "Content": "let $f\\in C^{(1)}[a,b]$,and such that $f(a)=f(b)=0$, show that $$\\int_{a}^{b}f^2(x)dx\\le (b-a)^2\\int_{a}^{b}[f'(x)]^2dx\\cdots\\cdots (1)$$ My try: use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have $$\\int_{a}^{b}[f'(x)]^2dx\\int_{a}^{b}x^2dx\\ge \\left(\\int_{a}^{b}xf'(x)dx\\right)^2$$\n  $$\\Longrightarrow \\int_{a}^{b}[f'(x)]^2dx\\ge\\dfrac{3\\left(\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b}xdf(x)\\right)^2}{(b^3-a^3)}=\\dfrac{3\\left(\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\\right)^2}{b^3-a^3}$$\n  so we only show that following \n  $$\\dfrac{3\\left(\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\\right)^2}{b^3-a^3}\\ge\\dfrac{\\displaystyle\\int_{a}^{b}f^2(x)dx}{(b-a)^2}$$\n  maybe this is not true. so How prove it by (1) Thank you",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $M=|f(x_0)|=\\|f\\|_{C[a,b]}.$ By Cauchy-Schwarz \n$$(b-a)^2\\int_a^bf'^2(x)dx\\ge (b-a)\\int_{a}^{x_0}1dx\\int_a^{x_0}f'^2(x)dx\\ge(b-a)\\left(\\int_a^{x_0}f'(x)dx\\right)^2$$$$=M^2(b-a)\\ge \\int_a^bf^2(x)dx$$\nwhere the last inequality follows from the fact that $f^2(x)\\le M^2.$ \nP.S. It is enough to request $f$ to vanish at one endpoint only.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to understand the original problem and extract the assumptions correctly.\n\nThe original question is about proving an integral inequality. The user mentions that the function f is in C¹([a, b]), which means it's continuously differentiable on the interval [a, b]. Also, f(a) = f(b) = 0. The goal is to show that the integral of f squared is less than or equal to (b-a) squared times the integral of the square of its derivative.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So, I need to list all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nFirst, the function f is in C¹([a, b]). That's one assumption. Then, f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 0. These are separate conditions on the function f at the endpoints a and b. Each should be a separate line. The problem is to prove the inequality stated.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption was split into two parts: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Similarly here, f is in C¹, and f(a)=0, f(b)=0. So each of these is a separate assumption. I need to make sure that each condition is on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf is in C¹([a, b]),\nf(a) = 0,\nf(b) = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫ₐᵇ f²(x)dx ≤ (b−a)² ∫ₐᵇ [f’(x)]² dx.\n\nI need to check if there are any other assumptions. The original problem states \"let f ∈ C¹([a,b])\" and \"such that f(a)=f(b)=0\". These are the only conditions. The user tried using Cauchy-Schwarz but ended up with a different approach and now is asking how to prove (1). So the main problem is as stated.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have the three assumptions: function class, boundary conditions at a and b. Then the problem statement. I think that's all. The example had two assumptions for the divisibility problem. Here, three assumptions: function's differentiability class, and two boundary conditions. Each on separate lines. Yes, that should be correct.",
