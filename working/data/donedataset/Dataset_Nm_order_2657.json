    "Content": "I am dealing with the test of the OBM (Brasilian Math Olimpyad), University level, 2017, phase 2. As I've said at another topic (question 1), I hope someone can help me to discuss this test. The question 2 says: Taking fixed positive integers $a$ and $b$, show that the set of the prime divisors of the sequence terms $a_n=a\\cdot 2017^n+b\\cdot 2016^n$ is infinite. The only thing that is on my mind is Dirichlet's Theorem: Given any $k,k'\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ coprime, the arithmetic progression of reason k' and inicial term k has infinite primes. However, I don't have ideas about how do it. Thanks very much. Edit September, 01 I was searching about recurrences and I found a little about Lucas sequences, it seems important: Lucas sequence",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose the set of primes dividing the sequence is finite instead, and number them $p_1,...,p_K.$ Associate to each term $a_n = a \\cdot 2016^n + b \\cdot 2017^n$ the index $i, 1 \\le i \\le K,$ such that biggest prime power that divides $a_n$ is  $p_i^{\\beta_i(n)}$. By the pigeonhole principle, there is an index $i_0$ and $a_n,a_m,\\,m>n,m-n \\le K,$ such that $a_n,a_m$ are both associated to $i_0,$ for each $n.$ Therefore, letting $l = \\min(\\beta_{i_0}(n),\\beta_{i_0}(m)),$ we get that $$ p_{i_0}^l | a\\cdot 2016^n + b\\cdot 2017^n, p_{i_0}^l | a \\cdot 2016^m + b\\cdot 2017^m.$$ The relations above imply, on the other hand, that $$ p_{i_0}^l | b\\cdot(2016^{m-n} - 2017^{m-n}). $$ From the fact that the number of primes is bounded, we get that $p_{i_0}^{l \\cdot K} \\ge 2017^n.$ On the other hand, by the equation above, $$ p_{i_0}^l \\le C \\cdot 2017^K.$$ As $K$ is fixed, we see that $$ 2017^{\\frac{n}{K} - K} \\le C, \\text{for infinitely many } n \\in \\mathbb{N}.$$ This leads to a contradiction by letting $n \\to \\infty.$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about showing that the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite, where a and b are fixed positive integers. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had two assumptions: one about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Here, the problem states that a and b are fixed positive integers. So the first assumption would be that a and b are positive integers. Wait, the problem says \"fixed positive integers a and b\", so each should be listed separately. But according to the format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe split them into two assumptions: \"a is a fixed positive integer\" and \"b is a fixed positive integer\". \n\nNext, the sequence term is defined as a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n. The problem is to show that the set of prime divisors of the terms a_n is infinite. So the problem statement would be exactly that. \n\nWait, the original problem doesn't mention any restrictions on n, except that it's part of the sequence terms. So n here is a non-negative integer, starting from 0 or 1? The problem says \"sequence terms\", so n is a positive integer or non-negative? The problem statement just says \"the sequence terms a_n\", so the index n is over the natural numbers. So maybe another assumption is \"n is a non-negative integer\", but the example didn't include that. Wait, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and there was another assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". \n\nIn the current problem, the user might be assuming that n ranges over positive integers (or non-negative). However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on n, except that it's part of the sequence. So perhaps an assumption here is \"n is a non-negative integer\". But the problem says \"the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n\", so the primes that divide any a_n for some n. So even if n starts at 0, unless a_0 is excluded. But the problem doesn't specify. Since the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps n is considered to be positive integers. But maybe the user didn't specify. However, the original problem may not have included that as an assumption, but for the format, we need to list all assumptions. Wait, the original problem says \"taking fixed positive integers a and b\", so those are given. The sequence terms are defined for n in which set? Probably n is a positive integer or non-negative. Since the problem is about showing infinitely many primes divide some term in the sequence, perhaps the exact starting point of n doesn't matter, but n must be varying over an infinite set. So maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But the user didn't specify that in their problem statement. So, do we need to include that as an assumption?\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\". So in that case, the problem statement included \"for every integer n\", which was converted into the assumption. So in the current problem, the sequence terms a_n are defined for all n, but the problem didn't specify the domain of n. However, in mathematical sequences, typically n is a non-negative integer unless specified otherwise. But the problem is to show that the set of primes dividing any a_n is infinite. So even if n starts at 0, unless a_0 is fixed and only has finitely many prime factors, but if a and b are fixed, then a_0 = a·2017^0 + b·2016^0 = a + b. So if a + b is fixed, then it's a constant, so it has finitely many prime divisors. Therefore, the problem must be considering n ≥ 1, or else the set would include primes from a + b and the other terms. However, the problem states \"the set of the prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n\", which would include primes dividing any a_n, for any n. So even if a_0 contributes some primes, as n increases, the terms a_n might introduce new primes. The problem wants to show that this set is infinite. Therefore, the sequence is defined for all non-negative integers n. However, the user might have intended n to be positive integers. However, in the problem statement, the user didn't specify. So in the assumptions, we should list what is given. The user says \"taking fixed positive integers a and b\", so a and b are fixed positive integers. Then the sequence is a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n. The problem is to show the set of prime divisors of a_n is infinite. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n- a is a fixed positive integer.\n- b is a fixed positive integer.\n- For each non-negative integer n, a_n is defined as a·2017^n + b·2016^n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in that case, the problem had conditions on n. In the current problem, the problem is about the primes dividing any a_n. So the assumptions would be about a and b, and perhaps that n is a non-negative integer. But the original problem does not explicitly state that n is a non-negative integer, but since it's a sequence, it's implied. However, the user in their problem statement wrote \"the sequence terms a_n=a·2017^n+b·2016^n\", so the index n is part of the sequence, hence n is a non-negative integer (assuming standard sequence definitions). So perhaps we need to include that as an assumption. \n\nBut in the example, the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\". Therefore, following the example, if the problem here is about a sequence, then n is a non-negative integer (unless otherwise stated). However, in the problem statement, it's not specified. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes n is a positive integer. But the user didn't specify. However, in Olympiad problems, sequences are often considered starting from n=1 unless stated otherwise. However, sometimes n=0 is allowed. But since the problem is about primes, and a_0 = a + b, which could be 1 or composite. If a and b are positive integers, then a + b ≥ 2, so a_0 is at least 2. However, the prime divisors of a_0 could be finite. But the problem states that the set of primes dividing any a_n is infinite. Therefore, even if a_0 contributes some primes, the rest of the terms must contribute infinitely many primes. But maybe the problem is considering n ≥ 1. However, since the problem statement does not specify, perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But the user didn't state that. So perhaps we should not include that as an assumption unless it's given. \n\nWait, in the problem statement, the user wrote \"the sequence terms a_n=a⋅2017^n+b⋅2016^n\". In mathematics, the term \"sequence\" usually implies that n is a non-negative integer unless specified otherwise. So perhaps the assumption here is that n is a non-negative integer. However, the problem might require n to be varying over positive integers. So maybe the answer needs to include that. But the problem as stated by the user does not mention n's range. Therefore, maybe the assumptions should include \"n is a non-negative integer\". But the example didn't include that, but in the example, the problem was \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Therefore, following that example, if the original problem had \"sequence terms a_n\", then n is a non-negative integer (if the problem says \"sequence terms\", but it's possible that n is any integer). But in this case, the problem is from an Olympiad, phase 2, so it's likely that n is a positive integer. However, the user's problem statement does not specify. \n\nHmm. To adhere to the example's format, where the original problem mentioned \"for every integer n\" and the assumption became \"n is an integer\", in this problem, since it's a sequence, the index n is typically non-negative. So perhaps an assumption is \"n is a non-negative integer\". But the problem statement as given by the user does not explicitly state this. However, since it's a sequence, it's implied. Therefore, to follow the format, which requires listing all assumptions, we need to include that n is a non-negative integer. But the user didn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe it's considered part of the problem's inherent assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's only assumptions are that a and b are fixed positive integers, and the rest is part of the problem statement. But in the example, they split the \"for every integer n\" into an assumption. So here, the problem is \"the sequence terms a_n = ...\", so the assumption is that n is varying over the indices of the sequence, which are non-negative integers. Therefore, we need to include \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption. However, the original problem didn't state that explicitly. But in mathematics, sequences are defined for n ≥ 0 unless otherwise specified. So maybe it's safe to include that as an assumption. \n\nSo, compiling the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\n\nBut wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". The original problem here does not specify any conditions on n except that it's part of the sequence. Therefore, the key assumptions are a and b being fixed positive integers, and n being non-negative integers. \n\nWait, but in the example, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\", they split into two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem here, there's no such division. The user's problem states \"taking fixed positive integers a and b\", so those are the given conditions. The rest is the problem. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer.\n\nThe problem is to show that the set of prime divisors of a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\n\nBut the problem statement mentions \"the sequence terms\", which implies n ranges over non-negative integers. So maybe in the problem statement, n is considered a non-negative integer. But if we follow the example, where the problem said \"for every integer n\", and the assumption was \"n is an integer\", then here, since it's a sequence, we need to make an assumption about n. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut the user's original problem didn't state that n is a non-negative integer. So perhaps it's part of the problem's inherent structure. However, since the problem is about a sequence, the definition of a sequence implies n is in the domain of non-negative integers. Therefore, the assumption is already implicit. But according to the example, explicit statements about the variables are listed as assumptions. Therefore, to be safe, we should include \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer,\nn is a non-negative integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)...\" So the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\", and then \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7; the formatted problem added that? Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer\", and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1 ) -6^n (3^n +2^n ) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\", and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. That seems like a mistake. Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would be incorrect. Wait, that example must have been a typo or error. Because the original problem is to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem restricts n to be divisible by 7, which changes the problem. Therefore, maybe the example provided by the user is incorrect, and thus the instructions might be flawed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the actual task is to extract the assumptions explicitly stated in the problem, not to infer them. Because in the example, the user incorrectly added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to list only the assumptions explicitly given in the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the original problem says: \"Taking fixed positive integers a and b, show that the set of the prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\" Therefore, the explicit assumptions are that a and b are fixed positive integers. The rest is part of the problem statement. So the sequence terms are defined as a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n, and the problem is to show the set of primes dividing any a_n is infinite. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\n\nBut then, what about the domain of n? Since the problem mentions \"sequence terms\", n is presumably a non-negative integer. But since the original problem didn't state that explicitly, maybe it's not considered an assumption here. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though the problem said \"for every integer n\". So following that example, if the problem mentions \"sequence terms\", which implies n is a non-negative integer, but the problem doesn't state it explicitly, should we include it as an assumption?\n\nHmm. If the example includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even when the problem says \"for every integer n\", then perhaps in this case, since the problem is about a sequence, which is indexed by non-negative integers, the assumption should be \"n is a non-negative integer\". However, the problem statement does not mention it. Therefore, this is a conflict. The user's example may have a mistake, but we need to follow the format. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem statement. The problem says \"Taking fixed positive integers a and b\", so those are the assumptions. The rest is the problem. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a fixed positive integer,\nb is a fixed positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of prime divisors of the sequence terms a_n = a·2017^n + b·2016^n is infinite.\n\nThis seems correct. The example may have had an error where they added an assumption not present in the original problem. Therefore, in our case, we should only list the assumptions given explicitly in the problem statement. The problem says \"Taking fixed positive integers a and b\", so those are the assumptions. The sequence terms are part of the problem statement. Therefore, the answer should be as above.",
