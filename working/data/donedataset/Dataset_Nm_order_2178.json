    "Content": "If $M$ is an artinian module and $f: M\\to M$ is an injective homomorphism, then $f$ is surjective. I somehow found out that if we consider the module $\\mathbb Z_{p^{\\infty}}$ denoting the submodule of the $\\mathbb{Z}$-module $\\mathbb{Q/Z}$ consisting of elements which are annihilated by some power of $p$, then it is artinian, but if we have the homomorphism $f(\\frac{1}{p^{k}})=\\frac{1}{p^{k+1}}$, then we get a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module homomorphism, but this map is not surjective, because $\\frac{1}{p}$ has no preimage. I would be very grateful if someone can tell me what is wrong with this counterexample? And how to prove the proposition above if it is correct? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "There is no well-defined homomorphism $f: \\mathbb Z_{p^\\infty} \\to \\mathbb Z_{p^\\infty}$ that satisfies $f\\left(\\frac{1}{p^k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p^{k+1}}$. The existence of such an $f$ would imply\n$$0 = f(0) = f(1) = f\\left(p \\frac{1}{p}\\right) = p f\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right) = p \\frac{1}{p^2} = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nwhich is a contradiction. To prove the proposition, consider the descending sequence of submodules\n$$M \\supseteq \\operatorname{im} f \\supseteq \\operatorname{im} f^2 \\supseteq \\operatorname{im} f^3 \\supseteq \\ldots.$$\nSince $M$ is Artinian, the sequence becomes stationary, say $\\operatorname{im} f^k = \\operatorname{im} f^{n}$ for all $k \\geq n$. Then $$M = \\operatorname{ker} f^n + \\operatorname{im} f^n.$$\n Indeed, for $x \\in M$ we have $f^n(x) \\in \\operatorname{im} f^n = \\operatorname{im} f^{2n}$, so there is a $y \\in M$ s.t. $f^{2n}(y) = f^n(x)$. Then $x = (x-f^n(y)) + f^n(y) \\in \\operatorname{ker} f^n + \\operatorname{im} f^n$. But $f$ is injective, so $f^n$ is injective as well, i.e. $\\operatorname{ker} f^n = 0$. Thus $\\operatorname{im} f^n = M$, so $f^n$ and hence $f$ is surjective.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about a proposition that if M is an Artinian module and f: M → M is an injective homomorphism, then f is surjective. They provided a counterexample using the module Z_{p^∞}, which is Artinian, and a homomorphism f defined by f(1/p^k) = 1/p^{k+1}, which is injective but not surjective. However, they're confused because the proposition claims it should be surjective, so they want to know what's wrong with their counterexample or how to prove the proposition.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. An Artinian module is one that satisfies the descending chain condition on submodules. Every decreasing sequence of submodules stabilizes. For the proposition, injective implies surjective in Artinian modules, similar to how it works for finite-dimensional vector spaces. \n\nThe user's counterexample is Z_{p^∞}, which is the Prufer p-group. This is indeed an Artinian module over Z because every proper submodule is cyclic of order p^k for some k, and any descending chain of submodules would eventually reach zero. So the module is Artinian. The map f they defined sends 1/p^k to 1/p^{k+1}. This is a Z-module homomorphism. Let's check injectivity: if f(x) = 0, then x must be 0. Suppose x = a/p^k for some integer a. Then f(x) = a/p^{k+1} = 0 in Q/Z, so a/p^{k+1} is an integer, which implies a is divisible by p^{k+1}. But x = a/p^k = (p^{k+1} m)/p^k = p m, so in Q/Z, p m is 0. Wait, but if a is divisible by p^{k+1}, then x = a/p^k would be p m / p^k = m / p^{k-1}, but in Q/Z, this would be zero only if m/p^{k-1} is an integer. Hmm, maybe I need to think again. Let me take specific elements. For example, take x = 1/p. Then f(x) = 1/p^2. If f(x) = 0, then 1/p^2 must be an integer in Q/Z, which it isn't, so the kernel is trivial. Therefore, f is injective. But f is not surjective because 1/p is not in the image. The image consists of elements of the form 1/p^{k+1}, so the preimage of 1/p would need to be some element y such that f(y) = 1/p, which would mean y = 1/p^0 = 1, but 1 is not in Z_{p^∞} because 1 is annihilated by 1, not a power of p. Wait, but in Q/Z, 1 is equivalent to 0, so maybe that's not right. Wait, Z_{p^∞} consists of elements annihilated by some power of p. So any element x in Z_{p^∞} has p^k x = 0 in Q/Z for some k. The element 1/p is in Z_{p^∞} because p*(1/p) = 1 ≡ 0 in Q/Z. So 1/p is in Z_{p^∞}. But f maps 1/p^k to 1/p^{k+1}. So to get 1/p as an image, we would need some y such that f(y) = 1/p. That would require y = 1/p^0 = 1. But 1 is not in Z_{p^∞} because p^1 *1 = p ≡ 0 mod Z? Wait, in Q/Z, 1 is equivalent to 0 + Z, so 1 is 0 in Q/Z. Wait, no. In Q/Z, the elements are equivalence classes where two rationals are equivalent if their difference is an integer. So 1 in Q is equivalent to 0 in Q/Z. Therefore, 1 is not an element of Z_{p^∞} because Z_{p^∞} is a subgroup of Q/Z. The elements are of the form a/p^k + Z, where a is integer. So 1/p^k + Z is in Z_{p^∞}. But 1 + Z is 0 in Q/Z. So, the element 1/p is in Z_{p^∞} because p*(1/p) = 1 ≡ 0 mod Z. But if we try to find a preimage of 1/p under f, we need an element y such that f(y) = 1/p. Since f(y) = y/p, right? Because f(1/p^k) = 1/p^{k+1}, which is like multiplying by 1/p. So solving f(y) = 1/p would mean y/p = 1/p, so y = 1. But 1 in Q/Z is 0, which would map to 0. So there's no y in Z_{p^∞} such that f(y) = 1/p, hence f is not surjective. \n\nBut this contradicts the proposition. Therefore, the user is confused. So what's wrong here? The proposition must have some additional conditions. Wait, maybe the proposition is true for Noetherian modules, but the user says Artinian. Let me check. In modules, for Artinian modules, injective endomorphisms are surjective. Similarly, for Noetherian modules, surjective endomorphisms are injective. Wait, perhaps I mixed them up. Let me recall: For Artinian modules, injective implies surjective. For Noetherian modules, surjective implies injective. So the proposition as stated is correct for Artinian modules. But the user's counterexample seems to contradict that. Therefore, there must be something wrong with the counterexample. \n\nWait, maybe Z_{p^∞} is not Artinian as a Z-module? But I thought it was. Let me check. The submodules of Z_{p^∞} are cyclic of order p^k. So the submodules form an ascending chain: ⟨1/p⟩ ⊂ ⟨1/p^2⟩ ⊂ ⟨1/p^3⟩ ⊂ ... So as an ascending chain, it doesn't stabilize, which means Z_{p^∞} is not Noetherian. But as a descending chain, if you take submodules, starting from Z_{p^∞} itself, then any descending chain would have to be of the form Z_{p^∞} ⊇ ⟨1/p⟩ ⊇ ⟨1/p^2⟩ ⊇ ... which is an infinite descending chain. Wait, but each step is a proper inclusion, so that would mean Z_{p^∞} is not Artinian either. Wait, but I thought that in the category of Z-modules, Artinian modules are those where every descending chain of submodules stabilizes. For Z_{p^∞}, does every descending chain stabilize? Let's see. Suppose we have a descending chain. Each submodule is of the form ⟨1/p^k⟩ for some k. If the chain is descending, then the submodules must get smaller. So the chain would look like ⟨1/p^{k_1}⟩ ⊇ ⟨1/p^{k_2}⟩ ⊇ ... with k_1 ≤ k_2 ≤ ... Wait, no, if it's descending, then the exponents should increase. Because ⟨1/p⟩ contains ⟨1/p^2⟩, which contains ⟨1/p^3⟩, etc. So a descending chain would be Z_{p^∞} ⊇ ⟨1/p⟩ ⊇ ⟨1/p^2⟩ ⊇ ... which is infinite and does not stabilize. Therefore, Z_{p^∞} is not Artinian. But the user claims it is Artinian. So this must be the mistake. Therefore, the user's assumption that Z_{p^∞} is Artinian is incorrect. Hence, their counterexample is invalid because the module is not Artinian. \n\nTherefore, the proposition holds: if M is Artinian and f: M→M is injective, then f is surjective. The user's counterexample fails because Z_{p^∞} is not Artinian. Hence, the proposition is correct, and the user's confusion comes from an incorrect belief that Z_{p^∞} is Artinian. \n\nTo confirm, let me recall: A module is Artinian if every descending chain of submodules stabilizes. For Z_{p^∞}, the descending chain ⟨1/p⟩ ⊇ ⟨1/p^2⟩ ⊇ ... does not stabilize, so it's not Artinian. However, it is Noetherian? No, because the ascending chains don't stabilize. So Z_{p^∞} is neither Noetherian nor Artinian. Therefore, the user's mistake was in thinking that Z_{p^∞} is Artinian. Therefore, their counterexample is not valid. \n\nSo, the answer is that the user's counterexample is incorrect because Z_{p^∞} is not Artinian. The proposition remains true, and the proof would involve using the Artinian condition to show that the image of f cannot be a proper submodule, hence f is surjective.",
