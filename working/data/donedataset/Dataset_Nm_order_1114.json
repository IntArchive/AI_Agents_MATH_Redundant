    "AcceptedAnswer": "Claim: $ int(A\\cup B) = int(A) \\cup int(B) \\iff \\partial A \\cap \\partial B \\subset \\partial (A \\cup B) $ Proof: Since you are more intrested in the ($\\Leftarrow$) part of the claim I will first prove that. For both parts of the proof, remeber that interior, exterior and boundary of a set is a partitioning of the whole space i.e. $int(A) \\cup \\partial A \\cup ext(A) = X$ where all three sets are disjoint . Also, interior and exterior are open sets. ($\\Leftarrow$)\nAs you have said $int(A) \\cup int(B) \\subset int(A\\cup B)$. So, I will only focus on proving $int(A\\cup B) \\subset int(A) \\cup int(B)$. Let $x \\in int (A \\cup B)$. If $x \\in int(A)$ or $x \\in int(B)$ then we are done. So, assume that $x \\notin int(A)$ and $x \\notin int(B)$. By hypothesis, if $x \\in \\partial A \\cap \\partial B$ then $x \\in \\partial(A\\cup B)$ but interior and boundary of $(A \\cup B)$ are disjoint which is a contradiction. So, $x \\notin \\partial A \\cap \\partial B$. Without loss of generality, assume that $x \\notin \\partial B$. Then, $x \\in ext(B)$ and either $x \\in \\partial A$ or $x \\in ext(A)$. Case 1: $x \\in \\partial A$, Since $x \\in ext(B)$, there is a neighborhood $V \\subset B^C$ of x. Since $x \\in int(A \\cup B)$ there is a neighborhood $U \\subset (A\\cup B)$ of x. Then,\n$U \\cap V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$. Note that $(U \\cap V) \\subset (A\\cup B) \\cap B^C \\subset A$. But since $x \\in \\partial A$, any neighborhood of $x$ must intersect non-trivially with $A^C$. Hence, it is a contradiction. So, $x \\notin \\partial A$. Case 2: $x \\in ext(A)$, $x \\in int(A \\cup B) \\subset A \\cup B \\subset \\bar A \\cup \\bar B = (int(A) \\cup\n\\partial A) \\cup (int(B) \\cup \\partial B)$. However $x \\in ext(A)$ and $x \\in ext(B)$ implying that $x \\notin int(A) \\cup \\partial A$ and\n$x \\notin int(B) \\cup \\partial B$ which is a contradiction. Therefore, $x \\in int(A)$ or $x \\in int(B)$ i.e. $x \\in int(A) \\cup int (B)$. $ (\\Rightarrow) $ Let $x \\in \\partial A \\cap \\partial B$. So, $x \\notin int(A) $ and $ x \\notin int(B)$ implying $x \\notin int(A) \\cup int(B) = int(A\\cup B)$. Thus, $x \\in \\partial (A \\cup B) \\cup ext(A\\cup B)$. Assume $x \\in ext(A \\cup B)$ then there is a neighborhood $P \\subset (A \\cup B)^C $ of $x$ (where $A^C$ means the complement for set $A$). But $(A \\cup B)^C \\subset A^C$. That is, we have a neighborhood of $x$ which is contained in $A^C$ meaning $ x \\notin \\partial A$ which is a contradiction. Hence, $x \\in \\partial(A\\cup B)$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know under what conditions the interior of the union of two sets A and B equals the union of their interiors. The example provided in the original question shows that generally, the union of the interiors is a subset of the interior of the union, but equality doesn't always hold. So, we need to find the conditions when they are equal.\n\nFirst, I should recall some topology basics. The interior of a set is the largest open set contained within it. For the union of A and B, the interior would be all points that have a neighborhood entirely contained in A ∪ B. The union of the interiors, int(A) ∪ int(B), would be points that have a neighborhood entirely in A or entirely in B.\n\nFor equality to hold between int(A ∪ B) and int(A) ∪ int(B), every point in the interior of A ∪ B must be in either the interior of A or the interior of B. That is, there are no points in A ∪ B that are interior points only when considering both A and B together, but not in either individually.\n\nSo, possible conditions could relate to the separation between A and B. For example, if A and B are both open, then their interiors are themselves, and the union's interior would be their union. But the question is more general. The user mentions that such a condition might help in proving the boundary equality when the closures of A and B are disjoint.\n\nLooking at the boundary condition: ∂(A ∪ B) = ∂A ∪ ∂B when closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. The user is connecting the interior equality with this boundary result. So perhaps the condition needed for the interior equality is related to the closures being disjoint? Let me think.\n\nIf the closures of A and B are disjoint, then A and B are separated in some way. Maybe that ensures that points in the interior of A ∪ B can't be approaching the other set, so they must lie entirely in one set's interior. Let me formalize that.\n\nSuppose closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. Then, for any point x in int(A ∪ B), x has a neighborhood N contained in A ∪ B. But since closures are disjoint, N can't intersect both A and B in a way that x is a limit point of both. Wait, maybe if the closures are disjoint, then the sets A and B are separated, meaning they are each closed and open in their union? Or perhaps they are both closed and open?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if A and B are both open, then int(A ∪ B) = A ∪ B = int(A) ∪ int(B). But the user might be looking for a more general condition. Alternatively, if one of the sets is open, maybe? Or if A and B are separated (i.e., each is disjoint from the closure of the other), then maybe the interiors behave nicely.\n\nWait, the condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is actually stronger than just being disjoint. It means that no point in the closure of A is in the closure of B and vice versa. So, if that's the case, then any point in A ∪ B can't be near both A and B. So, if x is in int(A ∪ B), then there's an open neighborhood around x in A ∪ B. But since x can't be near both A and B, this neighborhood must lie entirely in A or entirely in B, hence x is in int(A) or int(B). Therefore, equality holds.\n\nSo, the condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ would imply int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). Because any open set around a point in A ∪ B can't intersect both A and B, so it must lie entirely in one of them, hence the point is in the interior of that set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's idea is that when closure(A) and closure(B) are disjoint, then the equality holds for the interior, which in turn helps prove the boundary equality. Let me check:\n\nThe boundary of a set C is closure(C) \\ int(C). So, ∂(A ∪ B) = closure(A ∪ B) \\ int(A ∪ B). If closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, then closure(A ∪ B) = closure(A) ∪ closure(B). And if int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B), then ∂(A ∪ B) would be (closure(A) ∪ closure(B)) \\ (int(A) ∪ int(B)) = (closure(A) \\ int(A)) ∪ (closure(B) \\ int(B)) = ∂A ∪ ∂B. So, yes, if closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ and int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B), then the boundary equality follows.\n\nTherefore, the required condition for the interior equality is probably that closure(A) and closure(B) are disjoint. So, the assumption would be that the closures of A and B are disjoint. The problem then is to show that under this condition, the equality holds for the interiors, and subsequently, the boundaries.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user is asking when does the equality int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B) hold. They mention that if such a condition exists, they can prove the boundary equality when closures are disjoint. So maybe the answer is that the condition is precisely that closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. Alternatively, maybe a weaker condition? Let me verify with an example.\n\nTake X as the real line, A = [0,1), B = [1,2]. Then closure(A) = [0,1], closure(B) = [1,2], so their closures intersect at 1. However, int(A ∪ B) = (0,2), and int(A) ∪ int(B) = (0,1) ∪ (1,2). The point 1 is in the interior of A ∪ B (since (0,2) is open), but not in the union of the interiors. So equality fails here, which aligns with closure(A) ∩ closure(B) ≠ ∅.\n\nAnother example: Let A = (0,1), B = (1,2). Then closure(A) = [0,1], closure(B) = [1,2], so closures intersect at 1. However, int(A ∪ B) = (0,1) ∪ (1,2) which equals int(A) ∪ int(B). Wait, here even though closures intersect, the interiors union equals the interior of the union. Hmm, so maybe closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is not necessary? Wait, in this case, closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = {1} ≠ ∅, but int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). So this example shows that the condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is sufficient but not necessary.\n\nWait, but in this example, even though the closures intersect, the interiors still work out. So maybe the necessary and sufficient condition is different. Let me think. What's special here is that the intersection of closures is in the boundary of both sets. So maybe the condition is that the closures of A and B are disjoint, or the sets are both open and their closures intersect only in their boundaries? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that A and B are separated, i.e., each is disjoint from the closure of the other. That would mean A ∩ closure(B) = ∅ and closure(A) ∩ B = ∅. This is stronger than closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. Let's check:\n\nIf A and B are separated, then any point in A cannot be in closure(B) and vice versa. So, suppose x is in int(A ∪ B). Then there's an open neighborhood U of x contained in A ∪ B. If x were in A, since A is disjoint from closure(B), U cannot contain points from B approaching x, so U is contained in A, hence x ∈ int(A). Similarly if x is in B. So, int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). Therefore, separated sets (A and B are separated if each is disjoint from the closure of the other) would satisfy the equality.\n\nIn the previous example where A=(0,1), B=(1,2), they are not separated because closure(A) is [0,1], and B is (1,2), so closure(A) ∩ B = {1} ∩ (1,2) = ∅. Similarly, closure(B)=[1,2], and A=(0,1), so closure(B) ∩ A = {1} ∩ (0,1) = ∅. Therefore, A and B are separated. Wait, but in that case, they are separated, but their closures intersect at 1. Wait, no: separated sets require that A ∩ closure(B) = ∅ and closure(A) ∩ B = ∅. In this example, closure(B) = [1,2], so A ∩ closure(B) = (0,1) ∩ [1,2] = ∅. Similarly, closure(A) ∩ B = [0,1] ∩ (1,2) = ∅. So they are separated. But their closures do intersect at 1. So, separated sets can have closures that intersect, but the sets themselves are disjoint from the other's closure.\n\nWait, but in this example, even though they are separated, their closures intersect. But in this case, the interiors union equals the interior of the union. So, perhaps the condition is that A and B are separated (i.e., each is disjoint from the closure of the other). That would imply that int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). Let me check another example.\n\nLet X be the real line. Let A = (0,1), B = [1,2). Then closure(B) = [1,2], so A ∩ closure(B) = {1}, which is not empty. Therefore, A and B are not separated. Now, int(A ∪ B) = (0,2), while int(A) ∪ int(B) = (0,1) ∪ (1,2). So again, the point 1 is in int(A ∪ B) but not in the union of interiors. So here, since A and B are not separated, the equality fails.\n\nBut in the earlier example where A=(0,1), B=(1,2), which are separated, the equality holds. So maybe the condition is that A and B are separated. Then, in the user's case, if they have closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, then A and B are separated, because closure(A) ∩ B ⊆ closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, similarly for A ∩ closure(B). Therefore, closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ implies A and B are separated. So in that case, the equality holds. Therefore, the user's condition (closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅) is a sufficient condition for int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B), which then helps in proving the boundary equality.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about when does int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). So, possible answers could be when A and B are separated, or when closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. The former is a weaker condition than the latter. Because if closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, then A and B are separated, but separated sets can have closures intersecting as long as the sets themselves are disjoint from the other's closure.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the user's problem, since they are looking to prove the boundary equality when closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, the relevant condition for the interior equality is indeed closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. Therefore, the assumption would be that the closures of A and B are disjoint, and the problem is to prove the interior equality under that assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct condition is that A and B are separated (i.e., each is disjoint from the closure of the other). Then, even if their closures intersect elsewhere (not in the other set), the equality holds. But in the example where A=(0,1) and B=(1,2), their closures do intersect at 1, but since 1 is not in A or B, they are separated. In that case, the equality holds. So maybe the general condition is that A and B are separated, i.e., A ∩ closure(B) = ∅ and closure(A) ∩ B = ∅.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the user's question is that equality holds when A and B are separated sets (each is disjoint from the closure of the other). This is a standard result in topology. Alternatively, if the user's aim is to connect it with closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, which is a stronger condition, then that would also work.\n\nBut I need to check which condition is precisely required. Let me look up the standard result. In topology, it's known that if A and B are separated (i.e., each is disjoint from the closure of the other), then the closure of their union is the union of their closures, and the interior of their union is the union of their interiors. So yes, for int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B), the condition is that A and B are separated. However, closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ implies that A and B are separated, but separated sets can have closures that intersect as long as the intersection is not in either set.\n\nWait, no: if A and B are separated, then A ∩ closure(B) = ∅ and closure(A) ∩ B = ∅. This does not necessarily imply that closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. For example, take A = (0,1) and B = (1,2) in the real line. Then closure(A) = [0,1], closure(B) = [1,2], so their closures intersect at 1, but A and B are separated. However, closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = {1} ≠ ∅. So, in this case, the equality int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B) holds even though closures intersect. Therefore, the user's condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is stronger than necessary. The necessary and sufficient condition is that A and B are separated (each is disjoint from the other's closure).\n\nBut the user mentioned that they want to prove ∂(A ∪ B) = ∂A ∪ ∂B when closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. So, in that case, even if A and B are separated but their closures intersect, the boundary equality might not hold. Wait, in the example where A=(0,1), B=(1,2), closures intersect at 1, but ∂(A ∪ B) = {0,2} and ∂A ∪ ∂B = {0,1} ∪ {1,2} = {0,1,2}. So ∂(A ∪ B) ≠ ∂A ∪ ∂B. Therefore, the user's condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is necessary for the boundary equality. So even if A and B are separated, if their closures intersect, the boundary equality fails. Hence, to have both the interior equality and the boundary equality, the stronger condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is required.\n\nWait, but in the example where A=(0,1) and B=(1,2), which are separated but closures intersect at 1, the interior equality holds but the boundary equality does not. Therefore, the user needs closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ to prove the boundary equality, but the interior equality holds under the weaker condition of A and B being separated.\n\nBut the user's original question is about when does the interior equality hold, and they connected it to wanting to prove the boundary equality under closure disjointness. So perhaps the answer they are looking for is that the equality holds when A and B are separated, but to get the boundary equality, they need the stronger condition of closures being disjoint. Therefore, in the context of their problem, the condition for the interior equality would be that A and B are separated (each disjoint from the other's closure), but to get the boundary equality, they need closures to be disjoint.\n\nBut the user's problem is to ask when does the interior equality hold, regardless of the boundary part. The example they give is that if such a condition exists, then they can prove the boundary equality when closures are disjoint. So perhaps the answer is that the interior equality holds when A and B are separated (each is disjoint from the other's closure), which is a condition weaker than closures being disjoint. However, in their specific case, when closures are disjoint, the separatedness is satisfied, hence interior equality holds, allowing them to prove the boundary equality.\n\nBut to structure the problem as per the user's instruction, we need to list the assumptions and the problem. The original question is: \"When do we say that equality holds?\" referring to int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B). The user also mentions they want to use this to prove the boundary equality when closures are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the answer to when the interior equality holds is either when A and B are separated or when their closures are disjoint. However, the standard answer is that the equality holds if and only if A and B are separated (each is disjoint from the other's closure). But if we take the user's context where they are using the condition closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, which implies that A and B are separated (since closure(A) ∩ B ⊆ closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅, similarly for A ∩ closure(B)), then under this stronger condition, the equality holds.\n\nSo, for the user's purpose, they might need to state the condition as closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. But in topology literature, the correct condition for int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B) is that A and B are separated (each is disjoint from the other's closure). However, closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅ is a stronger condition that implies separatedness. Therefore, the user can use either condition depending on their needs.\n\nBut since the user mentions that with such a condition, they can prove the boundary equality when closures are disjoint, it's likely that the intended answer is that the equality holds when closure(A) ∩ closure(B) = ∅. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would be that closure(A) and closure(B) are disjoint, and the problem is to show that int(A ∪ B) = int(A) ∪ int(B) under this assumption.",
