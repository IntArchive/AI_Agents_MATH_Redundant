    "Content": "In my textbook it asks for me to: Prove that there is no constant $C$ such that $\\text{arccot}(x) - \\text{arctan}(\\frac{1}{x}) = C $ for all $x \\ne 0$. Explain why this does not violate the zero-derivative theorem. But I believe I have found such a $C$, i.e. $C =0$!\nI even asked WolframAlpha ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=arccot%28x%29+-+arctan%281%2Fx%29 ) which corroborates my answer. This question appears in Apostol's Calculus Volume I, Second Edition: Exersize 6.22-11b Edit: Mathematica's definition of arccot is different from the one in my textbook. Apostol's arccot maps a real number into $(0, \\pi)$ while Mathematica's maps a real number into $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$ Here they are super-imposed: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integral%28-1%2F%281%2Bx%5E2%29%29+%2B+pi%2F2%3B+arccot",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "So we'll take your textbook's definition:\n$$\n\\mbox{arccot}(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\arctan(x).\n$$ Then \n$$\n\\lim_{0^+} \\mbox{arccot} (x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\lim_{0^+} \\arctan(1/x)\n$$\nwhile\n$$\n\\lim_{0^-} \\mbox{arccot} (x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}=-\\lim_{0^-} \\arctan(1/x).\n$$\nSince its derivative is $0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^*$,\n$$\n\\mbox{arccot}(x)-\\arctan(1/x)=0\n$$\nfor all $x>0$ while\n$$\n\\mbox{arccot}(x)-\\arctan(1/x)=\\pi\n$$\nfor all $x<0$. This does not contradict the zero-derivative theorem because the function is not defined at $0$, so its domain is not connected.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to read through the original question carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe title of the question is asking if arccot(x) and arctan(1/x) are the same function. The user then presents a problem from their textbook: they need to prove that there's no constant C such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0. However, the user thinks they found C=0, which conflicts with the textbook's question. They checked WolframAlpha, which agreed with their answer, but then mention that Apostol's definition of arccot is different from Mathematica's. Apostol defines arccot with a range of (0, π), while Mathematica uses (-π/2, π/2). This difference in definitions explains the discrepancy.\n\nNow, I need to format this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let's start with the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. The problem is about arccot(x) and arctan(1/x).\n2. The textbook (Apostol's) defines arccot(x) with a range of (0, π).\n3. The domain is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\n4. The task is to show there's no constant C such that the difference between the two functions is constant for all x ≠ 0.\n5. The user initially thought C=0 works, but that's under a different definition (Mathematica's), not Apostol's.\n\nSo, each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n- The domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\n- arccot(x) is defined with a range of (0, π).\n- arctan(1/x) is considered as a function from real numbers (x ≠ 0) to its usual range, which is (-π/2, π/2) excluding 0.\n- The problem requires proving no constant C exists such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0.\n- The zero-derivative theorem (which states that if two functions have the same derivative on an interval, they differ by a constant) might be relevant, but the question explains why the lack of a constant C doesn't violate this theorem.\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions explaining why this doesn't violate the zero-derivative theorem. However, in the example provided, the problem part only includes the main question to prove. The \"explain why...\" part is part of the original question but perhaps needs to be included in the problem statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem includes proving divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem includes that as the problem. The assumptions listed were the conditions on n. So here, the problem part should include both proving no C exists and explaining about the zero-derivative theorem. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as in the example, which focuses on the main problem. Wait, looking at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user's example was a mistake, but in their instruction, they want to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the original problem. But in the original example, the problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, perhaps the example was a bad example. Because in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would mean that the problem is now to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't have that restriction. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on their example, even if the example has an error.\n\nBut in this current problem, the original question states that Apostol's definition of arccot(x) is different from Mathematica's. So the key assumption here is the definition of arccot(x) with range (0, π). The problem is to show that there's no constant C such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0, and explain why this doesn't violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nBut in the formatted problem, according to the user's example, the problem part is just the main question. The example's original problem had to prove divisibility by 91, and the formatted problem lists assumptions (even if they added an assumption not in the original problem). Wait, perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Let me check again: the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption that \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7. That seems like an error in the example. However, maybe the user intended to filter out unrelated information and list all necessary assumptions. Maybe the original problem required that n is divisible by 7, but the user's example had a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a hidden assumption. But this is confusing. Anyway, proceeding with the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- arccot(x) is defined with a range of (0, π) (Apostol's definition).\n- The domain is x ≠ 0.\n- The problem involves the functions arccot(x) and arctan(1/x).\n- The task is to prove no constant C exists such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0.\n- The explanation about the zero-derivative theorem is part of the problem.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function arccot(x) is defined with range (0, π),\nThe domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0,\nThe function arctan(1/x) is defined for x ≠ 0,\nThe problem requires proving no constant C exists such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0,\nThe zero-derivative theorem is referenced in the problem.\n\nWait, but the zero-derivative theorem is part of the problem's explanation, not an assumption. The problem statement includes two parts: proving no C exists and explaining why this doesn't violate the zero-derivative theorem. However, in the example, the problem part only includes the main question. So perhaps the problem part here should be both parts. But the example's formatted problem only included the main question. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that sometimes the problem might have implicit assumptions. But in this case, the key difference is the definition of arccot(x). So the main assumption is Apostol's definition of arccot(x) with range (0, π). The problem is to prove that no constant C exists and explain about the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem part should be concise. Let me look at the original problem statement again:\n\nOriginal question: Prove that there is no constant C such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0. Explain why this does not violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nSo the problem has two parts: prove no C exists, and explain the zero-derivative theorem part. But in the example, the problem part was just the main proof. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as in the example. So perhaps the problem part should include both tasks. Let's see.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted problem included that. So here, the problem would be the two parts: proving no C exists and explaining about the theorem. But maybe the user wants the main problem as the first part, and the explanation as part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the explanation is part of the problem. So the formatted problem would include both.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The function arccot(x) is defined with a range of (0, π).\n- The domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\n- The function arctan(1/x) is defined with its standard range (-π/2, π/2) excluding 0.\n\nWait, but arctan(1/x) has different behavior depending on the sign of x. For x > 0, 1/x is positive, so arctan(1/x) is in (0, π/2). For x < 0, 1/x is negative, so arctan(1/x) is in (-π/2, 0). Meanwhile, arccot(x) in Apostol's definition is always in (0, π). So perhaps another assumption is that x can be positive or negative. But the domain is already x ≠ 0.\n\nBut maybe the key assumption is the definition of arccot(x) to have range (0, π). The problem is to show that under this definition, no constant C exists, and then explain why this doesn't violate the zero-derivative theorem, which states that if two functions have derivatives that are equal on an interval, then they differ by a constant. The issue here is that the domain x ≠ 0 is not an interval but two separate intervals (x > 0 and x < 0). Hence, the theorem applies only on intervals, so the constant can be different on each interval. But the problem wants a single constant for all x ≠ 0, which is impossible. Therefore, the explanation is that the domain is not an interval, so the theorem doesn't apply globally.\n\nBut back to formatting. The assumptions should list:\n\n- arccot(x) is defined with a range of (0, π).\n- The domain of the functions is x ≠ 0.\n- arctan(1/x) is considered with its standard definition.\n\nThe problem is to prove that no constant C exists such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0, and explain why this doesn't violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nSo in the formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\narccot(x) is defined with range (0, π),\nThe domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0,\narctan(1/x) is defined for all x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no constant C such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0. Explain why this does not violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nWait, but the problem includes both parts. However, in the example, the problem part was only the main proof. But the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which in that case, the problem was just the main statement. However, in this case, the original problem has two parts. So the formatted problem should include both.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is the problem statement. So in this case, the problem would include both tasks.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\narccot(x) is defined with range (0, π),\nThe domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no constant C such that arccot(x) - arctan(1/x) = C for all x ≠ 0. Explain why this does not violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n\nBut wait, the definition of arctan(1/x) is standard, so maybe we don't need to list it as an assumption. The key assumption is the definition of arccot(x). Also, the domain is given in the problem (x ≠ 0). Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- arccot(x) is defined with a range of (0, π).\n- The domain is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\n\nThe problem includes both proving no C exists and explaining about the theorem.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \narccot(x) is defined with range (0, π),\nThe domain of consideration is all real numbers x ≠ 0.\nProblem:\nProve that there is no constant $C$ such that $\\mathrm{arccot}(x) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = C$ for all $x \\ne 0$. Explain why this does not violate the zero-derivative theorem.\n###\n\nI think this captures the necessary assumptions and the problem statement accurately. The key points are the definition of arccot and the domain, which affect the result. The problem includes both parts as in the original question.",
