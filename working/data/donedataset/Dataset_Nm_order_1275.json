    "Content": "$$\\text{If } f(x)=\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\\cdots+x+ 1\\text{, then show that } f(x) = 0\\\\ \\text{ has no repeated roots.}$$ I tried solving this question and I think I have come up with a proper answer. I need some verification. My solution/attempt First, we need to prove a theorem. Theorem 1 : If a polynomial function $f(x)$ has a repeated root (say $a$, i.e. $f(a)=0$), then $f'(a)=0$. Proof: We assume that $f(x)$ has a degree of $n \\geq 2$.\nSince $a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, we can write: $$f(x)=(x-a)^m\\cdot h(x) \\tag{1}$$\nwhere $2  \\leq m \\leq n$ and $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n - m$ On differentiating $(1)$, we can write\n$$f'(x) = m(x-a)^{m-1}\\cdot h(x) + (x-a)^m\\cdot h'(x)\\tag{2}$$ Plugging in $x=a$, we obtain\n$$f'(a)=0+0=0$$ Thus, theorem 1 is true. Now, from the question, we have\n$$f(x)=\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\\cdots+x+ 1\\tag{3}$$\nIf we plug in $x=0$, we get $f(0)=1 \\neq 0$, for any value of $n$. Hence $0$ is not a root of $f(x)$. On differentiating, we get\n$$f'(x)=\\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\\frac{x^{n-2}}{(n-2)!}+\\cdots+x+ 1\\tag{4}$$ From $(3)$ and $(4)$, we obtain\n$$f(x)-f'(x)=\\frac{x^n}{n!} \\tag{5}$$ Suppose $c \\neq 0$ is a root of $f(x)$. Then from $(4)$, we have $$f'(c)=-\\frac{c^n}{n!} \\neq 0\\tag{6}$$ Hence, from theorem 1 , we can conclude that $f(x)=0$ has no repeated roots. Q.E.D. My question I am a beginner in this field. Did I do all the steps correctly? Are there any points I need to take care of?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $e_{n}(x)=\\sum_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} {x^{k}\\over{k!}}$, therefore $f_{n}(x)=e^{x}-e_{n}(x)$. To find repeated roots we must solve $f_{n}(x)=f_{n}^{'}(x)=0$ which means $e_{n}(x)=e_{n}^{'}(x)=e^{x}$. Also differentiating $e_{n}(x)$ gives us $e_{n}^{'}(x)=\\sum_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} k{x^{k-1}\\over{k!}}=\\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} {x^{k}\\over{k!}}=e_{n-1}(x)$. Therefore we have $e_{n}(x)=e_{n-1}(x)$ to solve, which gives us the only answer x=0 which is incorrect when applying it to $f_{n}(x)=0$, and this is what we needed to prove.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to show that the polynomial f(x) = x^n/n! + x^(n-1)/(n-1)! + ... + x + 1 has no repeated roots. They attempted a proof using the theorem that if a polynomial has a repeated root a, then both f(a) and f'(a) are zero. \n\nFirst, I need to verify their approach. They derived f'(x) which seems correct. Then they subtracted f'(x) from f(x) and got x^n/n!. That step looks right because when you subtract the derivative term by term, each term cancels except the leading term of f(x). For example, the x^n/n! differentiates to x^(n-1)/(n-1)!, which is the next term in f(x), so subtracting f'(x) removes that term. This leaves only the highest degree term x^n/n! in f(x) - f'(x).\n\nNext, they assumed that c is a root of f(x), so f(c) = 0. Then, from the equation f(c) - f'(c) = c^n/n!, substituting f(c)=0 gives -f'(c) = c^n/n!, so f'(c) = -c^n/n!. Since c ≠ 0 (they checked x=0 isn't a root), then c^n/n! isn't zero. Therefore, f'(c) ≠ 0. By the theorem, if c were a repeated root, then f'(c) should be zero. But since it's not, there are no repeated roots.\n\nWait, but does this cover all possible roots? What if c=0? But they already checked that f(0)=1, so 0 isn't a root. So all roots are non-zero, hence for any root c, f'(c) ≠0. Therefore, by the theorem, there's no repeated roots. That seems solid.\n\nBut let me check if the original function f(x) is indeed a polynomial. Each term x^k/k! is a monomial, but when k! is in the denominator, unless n! divides into the coefficients, which isn't necessarily the case. Wait, hold on. Wait, in the given problem, f(x) is written as a sum of terms like x^k/k! for k from 0 to n. Wait, but x^0/0! is 1, which is the constant term. However, each term's coefficient is 1/k! for k from 0 to n. So f(x) is not a polynomial unless the denominators k! are integers, which they aren't except when k is 0,1. Wait, hold on. For example, when n=2, f(x) would be x^2/2! + x/1! + 1, which is (x²)/2 + x + 1. That's not a polynomial with integer coefficients, but it's still a polynomial with rational coefficients. Wait, but the problem states \"the polynomial function f(x)\", so even with coefficients that are fractions, it's still considered a polynomial. So f(x) is indeed a polynomial of degree n. So differentiation rules apply as usual. So their use of the derivative is valid.\n\nAnother point: the theorem they mentioned requires that f(x) is a polynomial. Since f(x) here is a polynomial, the theorem applies. Therefore, if any root c had multiplicity ≥2, then f'(c)=0. But they showed that f'(c) = -c^n/n! which is not zero because c ≠0. Therefore, no such root exists. Hence, all roots are simple.\n\nBut wait, is c^n/n! necessarily non-zero? If c is a root, then c is some complex number (unless restricted). But even if c is complex, if c ≠0, then c^n ≠0, so f'(c) = -c^n/n! ≠0. Therefore, the argument holds. \n\nTherefore, the user's proof seems correct. The only thing I might check is whether f(x) is indeed a polynomial, which it is, even with fractional coefficients, because each term is a monomial with coefficient, and the exponents are non-negative integers. So yes, it's a valid polynomial. Therefore, the proof is correct.\n\nPossible gaps? Maybe the user didn't specify the field over which they're working. The problem might be over the complex numbers, but since the coefficients are real (even rational), repeated roots would still have to satisfy f'(c)=0 regardless of the field. So the argument holds in any field of characteristic 0. If the characteristic were positive, there might be issues with differentiation, but since the problem doesn't specify, we can assume characteristic 0.\n\nAnother thing: the user checked x=0 isn't a root, which is important because if 0 were a root, their argument for f'(0) would be different. But since f(0)=1, which they correctly noted, 0 isn't a root. So all roots are non-zero, hence their calculation of f'(c) = -c^n/n! holds.\n\nTherefore, the user's solution is correct. They covered the necessary steps: derived the relationship between f and f', showed that at any root c≠0, the derivative is non-zero, hence no repeated roots. Good job.",
