    "AcceptedAnswer": "Any two nonzero rationals are linearly dependent: if $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, $a\\neq 0 \\neq b$, then there exist nonzero integers $n$ and $m$ such that $na + mb = 0$. So if $\\mathbb{Q}$ were free, it would be free of rank $1$, and hence cyclic. But $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not a cyclic $\\mathbb{Z}$ module (it is divisible, so it is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, the only infinite cyclic $\\mathbb{Z}$-module. So $\\mathbb{Q}$ cannot be free.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. Let me read the original question again. The user is asking why Q (the rational numbers) is not a free Z-module. They mention that in class, people use this fact trivially, but they don't understand why.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem is about showing that Q is not a free Z-module. So the assumptions would be related to the properties of Q and Z-modules.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing a single property or condition of one object. Let me think. The key objects here are Q and Z. The main assumption is that Q is a Z-module. Also, we need to note that we're considering the structure of Q as a module over Z. But does the problem have any other assumptions? The original problem doesn't specify any additional constraints, so the main assumption is that Q is a Z-module. Wait, but in the example provided, sometimes assumptions are about the properties of the objects involved. For instance, in the example, they listed that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about Q not being free as a Z-module. So maybe the assumption is just that Q is a Z-module. But maybe also, since we are working in the category of Z-modules, we might need to state that we're considering the usual module structure. Wait, but maybe the problem assumes the standard module structure of Q over Z. So perhaps the assumption is that Q is considered as a Z-module under the usual scalar multiplication. However, the original problem statement doesn't specify that, but since it's standard, maybe that's an implicit assumption. But in the example given, the user included assumptions that were part of the problem statement. The original problem here says \"How do we know that Q is not a free Z-module?\" So the main assumption here is that Q is a Z-module. Wait, but being a Z-module is not an assumption; it's a given because the question is about whether it's a free Z-module. So perhaps the assumptions are that Q is a Z-module, and we need to show it's not free. But maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the context. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was that n is an integer. Then there was another assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem in the example didn't have that second assumption. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original example problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe that was a typo in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem. That seems like an error. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But regardless, the instruction is to follow the format where assumptions are listed line by line. So in the current problem, the user is asking why Q is not a free Z-module. The assumptions here would be the properties of Q and Z-modules. Since the question is about Q being a Z-module, the main assumption is that we're considering Q as a Z-module. However, in the context of modules, Q is naturally a Z-module via the usual multiplication. So maybe the assumption is just that Q is a Z-module. But the problem is to show that it's not free. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the fact that Q is a Z-module. Therefore, the assumption line would be \"Q is a Z-module\". But maybe the problem doesn't need to state that as an assumption because it's part of the problem's premise. Wait, the problem is \"How do we know that Q is not a free Z-module?\" So the problem is to show that Q is not free as a Z-module, given that it is a Z-module. Therefore, the only assumption is that Q is a Z-module. So in the format, the assumption would be \"Q is a Z-module\", and the problem is \"Show that Q is not a free Z-module.\" But maybe the user's example included the divisibility by 7 even though it wasn't in the original problem. Wait, looking back, the original example had the problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem included assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's inconsistent. So the user's example might have included an error. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the assumptions as given in the problem. For the current problem, the only assumption is that we are considering Q as a Z-module. But in the problem statement, the user is asking why Q is not a free Z-module. The fact that Q is a Z-module is a given, not an assumption. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions to list here. However, the example included assumptions even if they were part of the problem's premise. Wait, the original example's problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the user's example added \"n is divisible by 7\" which is not in the original problem. So perhaps there was a mistake. Therefore, maybe in the current problem, since the question is \"Show that Q is not a free Z-module,\" the assumption is that Q is a Z-module. But since that's inherent to the question, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions beyond the objects involved. The example might have been incorrect, but following the user's instruction, I need to structure the problem as per their format. So, perhaps for this problem, the assumption is simply \"Q is a Z-module,\" and the problem is to show it's not free. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think again. In the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" not just those divisible by 7. So the user's example might be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to extract all conditions from the problem, even if they're part of the universal quantifier. In the current problem, there's no universal quantifier; it's a direct question about Q. So the only assumption is that Q is a Z-module, but that's inherent. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions to list here, but the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they're part of the problem's premise. So perhaps the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: Q is a Z-module.\nProblem: Show that Q is not a free Z-module.\n\nBut wait, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is correct. Then added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which seems incorrect. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. But in the current problem, the question is about Q being a Z-module, so the assumption is that Q is a Z-module. But since the question is about showing it's not free, that is the problem. So yes, the assumption is that Q is a Z-module, and the problem is to show it's not free. So that's the correct formatting.",
