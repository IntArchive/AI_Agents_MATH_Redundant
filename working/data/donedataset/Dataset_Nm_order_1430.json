    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let assume that for small $x$, $$\\sin x = x  + a x^2 + bx^3 + O(x^4)\\tag{1}$$ In this trigonometric circle we can compute $BC$ in two ways: First, considering the $ABC$ triangle: $$BC= \\sqrt{AB^2+AC^2}=\\sqrt{\\sin^2 x+\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2 x}\\right)^2}=\\\\= x+ax^2+\\left(b+\\frac18\\right)x^3+O(x^4) \\tag{2}$$ \n[*] Second, bisecting the angle $x$: $$BC = 2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2}=x+\\frac{a}{2} x^2 + \\frac{b}{4}x^3 + O(x^4)\\tag{3}$$ Equating (2) and (3) we get $a=0$ and $b=-\\frac{1}{6}$, that is: $\\sin x = x - \\frac16 x^3 + O(x^4)$ I'm not sure if this a geometric proof, though... [*] To prove (2) we only need to know the expansion, for $t\\to 0$: $$\\sqrt{1+t}=1+\\frac{t}{2}+\\cdots \\tag{4}$$\n(here and in the following expansions the dots means a remainder $O(t^{k+1})$ where $k$ is the highest exponent in the preceeding terms). Then \n$$\\sqrt{1-t^2}=1-\\frac{t^2}{2}+\\cdots \\\\\n(1-\\sqrt{1-t^2})^2=\\frac{t^4}{4}+\\cdots\\\\\nt^2+(1-\\sqrt{1-t^2})^2=t^2(1+\\frac{t^2}{4}+\\dots)\\\\\n\\sqrt{t^2+(1-\\sqrt{1-t^2})^2}=t (1+\\frac{t^2}{8}+\\cdots)\n=t +\\frac{t^3}{8}+\\cdots\n$$\nLetting $t=x+ax^2+bx^3+O(x^4)$ that gives $$ x+ax^2+bx^3+\\frac{x^3}{8}+O(x^4)$$ With some more work (I've verified it with Maxima), doing higher order expansions we can get more terms ($\\sin x = x -\\frac16 x^3 + \\frac{1}{120}x^5 +\\cdots$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about showing that sin x is approximately x - x³/6 when x approaches 0 using a geometric method, similar to how they showed cos x ~ 1 - x²/2.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the main conditions are that x approaches 0, and they're using a geometric approach, not Taylor series. So the assumptions should mention that x is approaching 0, and maybe that the method is geometric. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variables, not the method. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" which are conditions on the variable. So here, the key assumption is that x is approaching 0. The problem is part 2 of the original question: how to show sin x ~ x - x³/6 geometrically. The original question also mentions avoiding Taylor series, so that might be an assumption too. But the example didn't mention the method as an assumption, just the variable's properties. Hmm. The user's example focused on the variables and their conditions. So maybe here, the assumptions would be that x is approaching 0 and perhaps that the method is geometric. But the problem statement itself is to show the approximation using a geometric concept. So perhaps the assumption is just x approaching 0. Let me check the example again. The original problem in the example had to do with divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, the user wrote the assumption as n is an integer, and then in the problem statement, they included the divisibility by 7 in the problem. Wait, no. Wait the original example's formatted problem lists two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in that case, the assumptions are all the conditions on n. So in the current problem, the user's question is about when x approaches 0, so the assumption should be that x approaches 0. But the problem is part 2: how to show sin x ~ x - x³/6 with a geometric concept. So the method is part of the problem, not the assumption. Therefore, the assumption here is that x is approaching 0. Then the problem is to show the approximation using a geometric method. So in the formatted problem, the assumption is x approaches 0, and the problem is to show sin x ~ x - x³/6 with a geometric concept. But the original example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that for every integer n...\" but then in the formatted problem, they split into assumptions. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted assumption says \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait the original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't be that n is divisible by 7. Unless maybe the user intended to filter out some parts? Hmm. But perhaps the example is not accurate, but regardless, the current problem's formatting needs to be done. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is only that x approaches 0. The problem is part 2 of the original question: show sin x ~ x - x³/6 with a geometric method. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: x approaches 0.\n\nProblem: Show that sin x is approximately x - x³/6 using a geometric concept.\n\nBut the original example included multiple assumptions, each on a separate line. Here, there's only one assumption: x approaches 0. The problem is as stated. But the original question also mentions that the method should be geometric, not Taylor series. So perhaps the assumption should also include that the method is geometric? But in the example, assumptions were about the variables, not the method. The method is part of the problem's requirement. So in the problem statement, the user says \"How can show sin x ~ x - x³/6 with a geometric concept?\" So the problem is to show the approximation using a geometric method. Therefore, the assumption is x approaches 0, and the problem is to show the approximation with a geometric concept. So I think that's the correct way. Let me verify with the example. The example had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So similarly, here, the assumption is x approaches 0, and the problem is to show the approximation via geometry. So that's the correct structure.",
