    "Content": "How to prove\n  $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\ln\\left(\\,x^{2} + \\ln^{2}\\left(\\,\\cos\\left(\\,x\\,\\right)\\,\\right) \\,\\right)\\,{\\rm d}x\\ =\\ \\pi\\ln\\left(\\,\\ln\\left(\\, 2\\,\\right)\\,\\right)\n$$ I don't know how to answer it. When I asked this integral to my brother, after less than half hours he said it has a nice closed-form involving $\\pi$ and $\\ln\\left(2\\right)$ but, as always, he didn't tell me the closed-form and how to obtain it ( I didn't believe him and I think he tried to mess around with me ). I have also searched the similar question here but it looks like nothing is similar or related. Could anyone here please help me to obtain the closed form of the integral preferably with elementary ways ( high school methods )?. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Edit: He is being a little bit nice to me today, he said the closed form is $\\pi\\ln\\ln2$ and it's numerically correct. This is not a duplicate problem, I am looking for a proof without using complex analysis.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a real-analytic method. We have $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Large \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\ln \\left(x^{2} + \\ln^2\\cos x\\right) \\, {\\rm d}x=\\pi\\ln(\\ln2) \\tag1\n$$ Proof. Let $s$ be a real number such that $-1<s<1$ . One may use the following theorem ( proved here ) $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Large \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{\\cos \\left( s \\arctan \\left(\\frac{x}{-\\ln \\cos x}\\right)\\right)}{(x^2+\\ln^2\\! \\cos x)^{s/2}} \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{1}{\\ln^{s}\\!2}. \\tag2\n$$ We are then allowed to differentiate both sides of $(2)$ $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\partial_s \\left. \\left( \\frac{\\cos \\left( s \\arctan \\left(\\frac{x}{-\\ln \\cos x}\\right)\\right)}{(x^2+\\ln^2\\! \\cos x)^{s/2}}\\right) \\right|_{s=0} &=-\\frac 12 \\ln \\left(x^{2} + \\ln^2\\cos x\\right) \\\\\\\\\n\\partial_s \\left. \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{1}{\\ln^{s}\\!2}\\right) \\right|_{s=0} &=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln(\\ln2)\n\\end{align}\n$$ which gives the result $(1)$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to prove that the integral from 0 to π/2 of ln(x² + (ln cos x)²) dx equals π ln(ln 2). \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions integrating from 0 to π/2, so the limits are a key assumption. The integrand is ln(x² + (ln cos x)^2). So the function inside the log is x squared plus the square of the natural logarithm of cos x. The variable of integration is x, and the integral is definite over the interval [0, π/2]. \n\nThey also mention that the closed-form is π ln(ln 2), which is verified numerically. The user wants a proof without complex analysis, preferably elementary methods. However, the assumptions part should focus on the problem's conditions, not the methods. So the main assumptions are the integral setup: the limits, the integrand, and that cos x is being considered in the domain [0, π/2], where cos x is non-negative, so ln cos x is real but negative since cos x ≤1. So ln cos x is real here, which is important because otherwise, the integrand would involve complex numbers.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is ln(x² + (ln cos x)^2).\n- cos x is considered for x in [0, π/2], ensuring ln cos x is real.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement doesn't explicitly state conditions on x, but since the integral is from 0 to π/2, x is in that interval. So maybe the main assumptions are:\n\n1. The integral is computed from 0 to π/2.\n2. The integrand is the natural logarithm of (x² + (ln(cos x))²).\n3. The problem requires proving the result equals π ln(ln 2).\n\nBut the user might not have stated any additional conditions. The original problem doesn't specify any particular constraints beyond the integral itself. So perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's structure and interval. Since the example given for the previous problem listed the variable's conditions, here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is ln(x² + (ln(cos x))²).\n\nBut each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So split into two:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed from 0 to π/2,\nThe integrand is the natural logarithm of (x² + (ln(cos x))²).\n\nWait, but \"integrand is...\" is one assumption. The other is the interval. So two separate assumptions. Then the problem is to prove the integral equals π ln(ln 2). \n\nYes, that's correct. The problem doesn't have any other stated conditions. So I think that's all. Let me check the example again. In the example, they listed n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. Here, the integral is over [0, π/2], which is one assumption, and the integrand being ln(...) is another. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2],\nThe integrand is ln(x² + (ln(cos x))²).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals π ln(ln 2).\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The user didn't mention any other constraints, so those two are the main assumptions. I don't see any other hidden conditions. The problem is to compute that definite integral and show it's equal to the given value. So the formatted answer should follow that structure.",
