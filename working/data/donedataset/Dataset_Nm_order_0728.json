    "Content": "Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ satisfying $p(x)\\geq 0$ for all $x$. That is, for all $x$, $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \\geq 0$, $a_n\\neq 0$. Show that $p(x)+p'(x)+p''(x)+\\cdots+p^{(n)}(x)\\geq 0$ for all $x$ where $p^{(i)}(x)$ is the $i^\\text{th}$  derivative. My interest : I know that, we can rewrite the LDE as follows $$\np(x)+p'(x)+p''(x)+\\cdots+p^{(n)}(x) = Lp(x)\n$$ where $L := I + D + D^2  + \\cdots + D^{(n)}$. Can we say anything about a linear operator of this kind so that it does not change the sign of the input it takes? I can try to solve the question by writing for all the derivatives and factoring them using $p(x)$, but I think there should be a clever way of showing this by the properties of $L$. Can I figure out a solution by just looking at $L$ and the sign of $p(x)$ as in the question? Where should I look for that?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Instead of $L_n := (1 + D + D^2 + \\dots + D^{n})$, use $L_{\\infty} := (1 + D + D^2 + \\dots)$, which comes to the same thing for polynomials of degree $n$ or less. If we let $$\\sigma(x) = p(x)+p'(x)+p''(x)+\\dots+p^{(n)}(x) = L_{\\infty}(p)(x)$$ then we can sum the geometric progression in $D$ to get $$\\sigma(x) = ((1 + D + D^2 + \\dots)p)(x) = ((1-D)^{-1}p)(x)$$ Thus $$p(x) = ((1-D)\\sigma)(x)$$ This might look like trickery, but if you check it against the original expression for $\\sigma$ you can see that it works: $$((1-D)\\sigma)(x) = p(x)+p'(x)+p''(x)+\\dots+p^{(n)}(x) - \n(p'(x)+p''(x)+\\dots+p^{(n)}(x))$$ \n$$= p(x)$$ Now define $\\tau(x) = e^{-x}\\sigma(x)$, so $\\tau'(x) = e^{-x}(\\sigma'(x) - \\sigma(x)) = e^{-x}((D-1)\\sigma)(x) = -e^{-x}p(x)$. By hypothesis, this is $ \\le 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb R$. Also, $\\sigma$ is a polynomial, so $\\tau(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore $\\tau(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$. Hence $\\sigma(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$, which is what we wanted.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem as per the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user mentions a polynomial p(x) of degree n that is non-negative for all x. Also, they specify that a_n is not zero, which means it's a genuine degree n polynomial. The problem is to show that the sum of the polynomial and all its derivatives up to the nth derivative is also non-negative for all x.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions step by step. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let's see:\n\n1. The first object is p(x), which is a polynomial. The degree is n, so that's one assumption: \"p(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\"\n\n2. The polynomial is non-negative for all x: \"p(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\"\n\n3. The leading coefficient a_n is non-zero: \"a_n ≠ 0.\" Although this is implied by being a degree n polynomial, sometimes people might consider polynomials where leading coefficients could be zero (if not specified), so it's safe to include this as a separate assumption.\n\nWait, actually, in standard definitions, a polynomial of degree n must have a_n ≠ 0. So maybe the third assumption is redundant. The original question says \"a polynomial of degree n satisfying p(x) ≥ 0 for all x. That is, for all x, p(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0 ≥ 0, a_n ≠ 0.\" So the user explicitly mentions a_n ≠ 0. Therefore, even though degree n implies a_n ≠ 0, since the user lists it separately, I should include it as a separate assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- p(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\n- p(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n- a_n ≠ 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. Now the problem is to show that p(x) + p'(x) + ... + p^{(n)}(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"Show that p(x) + p'(x) + ... + p^{(n)}(x) ≥ 0 for all x\". So the problem statement is clear. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other assumptions. The user also talks about the operator L = I + D + ... + D^n. But that's part of their own interest, not part of the original problem's assumptions. The original problem only gives the polynomial and its non-negativity. So those three assumptions are the key ones.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\np(x) is a polynomial of degree n,\np(x) ≥ 0 for all x,\na_n ≠ 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$p(x) + p'(x) + p''(x) + \\cdots + p^{(n)}(x) \\geq 0$$ for all x.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the assumptions are just that p is a degree n polynomial, non-negative everywhere, and a_n ≠ 0.\n\nI think that's all. The problem is to show the sum of the polynomial and all its derivatives up to order n is non-negative. So I think that's the correct structuring. Let me double-check the original question.\n\nOriginal question:\n\n\"Let p(x) be a polynomial of degree n satisfying p(x)≥0 for all x. That is, for all x, p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ≥ 0, a_n≠0. Show that p(x)+p'(x)+p''(x)+\\cdots+p^{(n)}(x)≥0 for all x where p^{(i)}(x) is the i^th derivative.\"\n\nYes, so the assumptions are:\n\n- p(x) is a polynomial of degree n.\n\n- p(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\n- a_n ≠ 0.\n\nProblem is to show the sum is non-negative.",
