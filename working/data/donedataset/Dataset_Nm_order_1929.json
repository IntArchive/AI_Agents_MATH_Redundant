    "Content": "$\\DeclareMathOperator{\\inv}{inv}$ I am trying to understand the proof of the following from this document: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold which admits a group structure such that the multiplication map $m:G\\times G\\to G$ defined as $m(g, h)=gh$ for all $g, h\\in G$ is a smooth map.\nThen the inversion map $\\inv:G\\to G$ defined as $\\inv(g)=g^{-1}$ for all $g\\in G$ is a smooth map. The proof in the document proceeds as follows:\nFirst note that the multiplication map is a constant rank surjective smooth map, and is therefore a submersion. Therefore, the level set $\\Delta=m^{-1}(e)$ of $e\\in G$ , $e$ being the identity of the group structure, is an embedded submanifold of $G\\times G$ of dimension $n$ . Now let $\\pi_1:G\\times G\\to G$ be the projection on the first coordinate.\nConsider the map $\\pi_1\\circ i:\\Delta\\to G$ , where $i:\\Delta\\to G\\times G$ is the inclusion map, which we know is a smooth embedding. It is claimed in the document that $\\pi_1\\circ i$ is a diffeomorphism.\nThe reasoning given seems to be this: The map $\\pi_1\\circ i$ is smooth and is a homeomorphism and hence by the inverse function theorem, it is also a diffeomorphism. This seems to suggest that any smooth homeomorphism is a diffeomorphism. But this is not true since the map $x\\mapsto x^3:\\mathbf R\\to \\mathbf R$ is a smooth topological embedding but not an immersion at $x=0$ . How do I show that that composition $\\pi_1\\circ i$ is a diffeomorphism?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are right, the argument isn't conclusive, it's missing a piece, but it's fixable. You need to note that the map $p_1=\\pi_1\\circ\\iota:\\Delta'\\to G$ has constant rank equal to $\\dim G=\\dim\\Delta'$. Indeed, let $m=(g,g^{-1})\\in\\Delta'$ be a point in $\\Delta'$, then \n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\theta_g&:&G\\times G&\\longrightarrow & G\\times G\\\\\n&&(x,y) & \\longmapsto &(gx,yg^{-1})\n\\end{array}\nis a diffeomorphism of $G\\times G$ and sends $\\Delta'$ diffeomorphically to itself (let's call $\\widetilde{\\theta_g}$ the induced diffeomorphism of $\\Delta'$). Then $$p_1\\circ\\widetilde{\\theta_g}=\\pi_1\\circ\\iota\\circ\\widetilde{\\theta_g}=\\pi_1\\circ\\theta_g\\circ\\iota=L_g\\circ\\pi_1\\circ\\iota=L_g\\circ p_1$$ (where $L_g$ is left multiplication by $g$). If we calculate the differentials at $m_0=(e,e)\\in\\Delta'$, we get\n$$d_{m}p_1\\circ d_{m_0}\\widetilde{\\theta_g}=d_eL_g\\circ d_{m_0}p_1 $$\nSince $\\widetilde{\\theta_g}$ and $L_g$ are diffeomorphisms, $p_1$ has the same rank at $m\\in\\Delta'$ as at $m_0\\in\\Delta'$, so that it has constant rank ($\\leq\\dim G$). It follows from the constant rank theorem (see the first theorem in these notes ) and the bijectivity of $p_1$, that $p_1$ has constant rank equal to $\\dim G$, and now you can apply the global inversion theorem.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and figure out the assumptions and the core issue. The user is talking about Lie groups and the smoothness of the inversion map. The original problem seems to be about understanding a proof where they want to show that the inversion map is smooth. The proof uses the fact that the multiplication map is a submersion and then considers the level set of the identity element. They project this level set onto the first coordinate and claim that this projection is a diffeomorphism. However, the user is confused because the argument given seems to suggest that a smooth homeomorphism is automatically a diffeomorphism, which isn't true in general, like with x cubed on the real line.\n\nSo the main problem here is to figure out why, in this specific case, the map π₁∘i is a diffeomorphism despite the general case not holding. The user is pointing out a flaw in the reasoning if it were general, but in this particular setup, there must be something else ensuring that π₁∘i is not just a homeomorphism but also a diffeomorphism.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions from the problem. Let's go through the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem starts by stating that M is a smooth manifold with a group structure where multiplication is smooth. Then they want to show inversion is smooth. The proof steps involve the multiplication map m being a constant rank surjective smooth map, hence a submersion. Then the preimage of the identity under m, which is Δ = m⁻¹(e), is an embedded submanifold of G×G. Then π₁ is the projection to the first coordinate. The map π₁∘i, where i is inclusion of Δ into G×G, is claimed to be a diffeomorphism because it's a smooth homeomorphism, hence by inverse function theorem a diffeomorphism. The user objects, citing x³ as a counterexample. So the problem is to show π₁∘i is a diffeomorphism.\n\nAssumptions would be:\n\n1. G is a smooth manifold.\n2. G has a group structure where multiplication m: G×G → G is smooth.\n3. The multiplication map m is a constant rank surjective smooth map (hence a submersion).\n4. Δ = m⁻¹(e) is an embedded submanifold of G×G of dimension n (same as G).\n5. π₁: G×G → G is the projection onto the first coordinate.\n6. i: Δ → G×G is the inclusion map, which is a smooth embedding.\n7. The map π₁∘i: Δ → G is smooth and a homeomorphism.\n\nThe problem is to show that π₁∘i is a diffeomorphism, addressing the user's confusion about why the inverse function theorem applies here despite the general case not holding. The key must be that in this specific setup, the map is not just any smooth homeomorphism but has some additional properties, maybe that it's a bijective immersion or something, which would make it a diffeomorphism. Alternatively, since Δ is an embedded submanifold and π₁∘i is a smooth homeomorphism, perhaps the inverse is also smooth because of the group structure.\n\nBut according to the inverse function theorem, if a smooth map between smooth manifolds is a bijection and its derivative is an isomorphism at every point, then it's a diffeomorphism. So maybe in this case, the derivative of π₁∘i is non-singular everywhere, hence the inverse is smooth. The user's example x³ fails because the derivative at 0 is zero, so it's not an immersion there. So in the given problem, maybe the map π₁∘i is an immersion (since m is a submersion and Δ is its fiber?), hence a bijective immersion, which would be a diffeomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe because Δ is the set of pairs (g, h) such that gh = e, so h = g⁻¹. So Δ is the graph of the inversion map. Then projecting onto the first coordinate would be a bijection from Δ to G, with inverse map sending g to (g, g⁻¹). Then π₁∘i is essentially the map (g, g⁻¹) ↦ g, which is a diffeomorphism if the inversion is smooth. Wait, but we are trying to prove inversion is smooth. So maybe this is a circular argument? Or perhaps since Δ is an embedded submanifold, and the projection is smooth and bijective, and because of the properties of the group, the inverse is smooth.\n\nAlternatively, since m is a submersion, the implicit function theorem tells us that Δ is a submanifold. Then, the projection π₁ restricted to Δ is a smooth bijection, and perhaps because of the group structure, the inverse is also smooth. Alternatively, the inverse function theorem applies because the derivative of π₁∘i is invertible everywhere. Let's see: π₁∘i takes (g, g⁻¹) to g. The derivative at a point (g, g⁻¹) would be the derivative of π₁ restricted to Δ. Since Δ is the set of (g, g⁻¹), the tangent space at (g, g⁻¹) is the set of vectors (v, w) in T_g G × T_{g⁻¹} G such that dm_{(g, g⁻¹)}(v, w) = 0, since Δ is m⁻¹(e). But dm_{(g, g⁻¹)}(v, w) = d(mult)_(g, g⁻¹)(v, w) = v * g⁻¹ + g * w (using derivative of multiplication, maybe left and right translations). But since m(g, g⁻¹) = e, then the derivative condition would be v * g⁻¹ + g * w = 0. Then the tangent space at (g, g⁻¹) is the set of (v, w) such that v * g⁻¹ = - g * w.\n\nBut the projection π₁∘i on the tangent space would take (v, w) to v. To check if this derivative is an isomorphism, we need to see if every v in T_g G can be achieved uniquely by such a (v, w). Given v, can we solve for w? From v * g⁻¹ = - g * w ⇒ w = - g⁻¹ * v * g⁻¹. Wait, perhaps this is in terms of group operations. If we use left translation, then maybe w = - L_{g^{-1}}(v) * g^{-1}? Not sure, but the key is that for each v, there exists a unique w such that (v, w) is in the tangent space. Therefore, the derivative of π₁∘i at any point (g, g⁻¹) is a linear isomorphism, since given any v, there's a unique w making (v, w) tangent to Δ. Hence, π₁∘i is a smooth bijection with everywhere invertible derivative, so by inverse function theorem, it's a diffeomorphism.\n\nThus, the key assumption here is that π₁∘i is a smooth homeomorphism with derivative being an isomorphism everywhere, hence the inverse function theorem applies. The user's confusion comes from thinking that any smooth homeomorphism is a diffeomorphism, but in this case, the additional structure (i.e., the derivative being invertible due to the group operations) ensures that it's a diffeomorphism.\n\nSo the problem, after filtering out the context and the user's confusion, is to show that π₁∘i is a diffeomorphism, given that G is a Lie group with smooth multiplication, Δ is m⁻¹(e) which is an embedded submanifold, π₁ is the projection, and π₁∘i is a smooth homeomorphism. The core problem is proving that this map is a diffeomorphism, addressing why the inverse function theorem applies here despite the general case not holding.",
