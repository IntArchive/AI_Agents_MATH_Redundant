    "Content": "I'm self-studying some complex analysis, and apparently holomorphic bijections between two annuli exist precisely when the ratios of the radii are the same. More exactly, if $A_{\\sigma,\\rho}=\\{z\\in\\mathbb{C}:\\sigma<|z|<\\rho\\}$, then there is a holomorphic bijection between $A_{\\sigma,\\rho}$ and $A_{\\sigma',\\rho'}$ iff $\\rho/\\sigma=\\rho'/\\sigma'$. Is there a reference where this fact is proven? Or can a proof be included here if it's not overly involved? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This result (sometimes called Schottky's theorem) can be proved without any heavy machinery like Riemann mapping or even Schwarz reflection. I give two versions of the proof, with comments at the end. Claim . If there exists a bijective holomorphic map $f: A_{r,R}\\to A_{s,S}$, then $S/s\\ge R/r$. Note that we actually get equality by considering the inverse. Proof . Normalize to $r=s=1$. By composing $f$ with inversion, we can make sure that $|f(z)|\\to 1$ as $|z|\\to1$. For $1<t<R$ let $A(t)$ denote the area within the Jordan curve $f(\\{z:|z|=t\\})$. There is a standard way to relate the area to the coefficient of the Laurent series $f(z)=\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z} c_n z^n$: namely, use Green's formula for area in complex notation. \n$$A(t)=\\frac{1}{2i} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}  f(te^{i\\theta}) \\bar f(te^{i\\theta})\\, d\\theta = \\pi \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z}  n|c_n|^2t^{2n}$$ \nSince $A(1+)=\\pi$, we have \n$$(1)\\qquad\\qquad \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z}  n|c_n|^2=1.$$\nFrom here the proof can proceed in at least two ways. Version I: stick to area . Using (1), write\n$$A(t)-\\pi t^2=\\pi t^2 \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z}  n|c_n|^2(t^{2n-2}-1)\\ge0$$\nwhere the inequality holds term-wise. Hence $A(R-)\\ge \\pi R^2$, which implies $S\\ge R$. QED Version II: use $L^2$ norm . For $1<t<R$ define\n$$U(t)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi t} \\int_{|z|=t} |f(z)|^2|dz|$$ \nAgain, this can be put in terms of coefficients either by direct computation with $|f|^2=f\\bar f$, or by Parseval's identity: \n $U(t)= \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z} |c_n|^2 t^{2n}$.\nSince $U(1+)=1$ and \n$$U'(t)-2t= 2t\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb Z}  n|c_n|^2 (t^{2n-2}-1)\\ge 0 $$\nit follows that $U(R-)\\ge R^2$. But $|f|\\le S$, which implies $S\\ge R$. QED Comments: the idea of relating coefficients to area as in (1) goes back to Gronwall . In the context of this problem it was used by Pólya and Szegő in Problems and Theorems in Analysis II , part IV, problem 83 on page 15. Their solution is essentially Version I. I learned it from a short note by Pietro Poggi-Corradini. The idea of using $L^2$ norm instead of area may look counterproductive, since Version II is longer. But it is a more robust argument, which works for harmonic maps as well. Robert Burckel and Pietro pointed out Version II to us as a simplification of $L^2$ argument specialized to holomorphic maps.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format this Math Stack Exchange question according to the given example. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"When can we find holomorphic bijections between annuli?\" and the question body talks about the existence of holomorphic bijections between two annuli A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'}. The key point mentioned is that such bijections exist precisely when the ratios of the radii (ρ/σ and ρ'/σ') are equal. The user is asking for a reference where this fact is proven or a proof if it's not too involved.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. The annuli are defined as A_{σ,ρ} = {z ∈ ℂ : σ < |z| < ρ} and similarly for A_{σ',ρ'}.\n2. The problem considers the existence of a holomorphic bijection between these two annuli.\n3. The main condition is that the ratio of the outer to inner radii must be equal (ρ/σ = ρ'/σ').\n\nWait, the original problem states that such bijections exist \"precisely when the ratios of the radii are the same\". So the assumption here is that ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'. But in the example provided by the user, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem here, the main condition is the equality of the ratios. But are there any other implicit assumptions?\n\nLooking at the problem, the annuli must be non-degenerate, meaning that σ < ρ and σ' < ρ'. Otherwise, the annulus would be empty or a punctured disk. So perhaps those are necessary assumptions as well.\n\nSo the assumptions should include:\n\n- σ and ρ are positive real numbers with σ < ρ.\n- σ' and ρ' are positive real numbers with σ' < ρ'.\n- The ratio ρ/σ is equal to ρ'/σ'.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to different objects (the radii of the first annulus, the radii of the second annulus, and their ratio equality).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that a holomorphic bijection exists between A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'} if and only if ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions that the user heard this fact and is asking for a reference or a proof. So the problem as stated is the equivalence (iff) between the existence of the holomorphic bijection and the equality of the ratios.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- σ and ρ are positive real numbers such that σ < ρ.\n- σ' and ρ' are positive real numbers such that σ' < ρ'.\n- The ratio ρ/σ is equal to ρ'/σ'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic bijection between A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'} if and only if ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user says \"holomorphic bijections between two annuli exist precisely when the ratios of the radii are the same\". So the problem is to prove that the existence of such a bijection is equivalent to the ratio condition. Therefore, the \"if and only if\" is part of the problem statement.\n\nSo the assumptions are the definitions of the annuli and their non-degeneracy, and the problem is to show the equivalence. However, in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A_{σ,ρ} is the annulus {z ∈ ℂ : σ < |z| < ρ} where σ and ρ are positive real numbers with σ < ρ.\n- A_{σ',ρ'} is the annulus {z ∈ ℂ : σ' < |z| < ρ'} where σ' and ρ' are positive real numbers with σ' < ρ'.\n- The problem is to prove that a holomorphic bijection exists between A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'} if and only if ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nBut how to split these into individual assumptions? Each line should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nσ and ρ are positive real numbers,\nσ < ρ,\nσ' and ρ' are positive real numbers,\nσ' < ρ',\nρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nBut wait, the equality of ratios is actually the condition to be proven as equivalent to the existence of the bijection. Wait, no. The problem is to prove the equivalence, so the \"if and only if\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the annuli to exist, i.e., the radii are positive and the inner radius is less than the outer radius for both annuli. The equality of the ratios is part of the problem's conclusion, not an assumption.\n\nWait, no. The user is stating that the existence of the bijection is equivalent to the ratio condition. So the problem is to prove that equivalence. Therefore, the problem statement includes the \"if and only if\". Therefore, the assumptions are the basic conditions on the annuli (σ < ρ, σ' < ρ', positive radii), and the problem is to show that a holomorphic bijection exists between them iff the ratios are equal.\n\nBut the example given had assumptions that included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in this case, perhaps the assumptions are just the basic setup (the annuli are defined with radii such that they are non-degenerate), and the problem is the equivalence statement.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nA_{σ,ρ} is an annulus with σ < |z| < ρ where σ, ρ are positive real numbers and σ < ρ,\nA_{σ',ρ'} is an annulus with σ' < |z| < ρ' where σ', ρ' are positive real numbers and σ' < ρ'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic bijection between A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'} if and only if ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nσ and ρ are positive real numbers,\nσ < ρ,\nσ' and ρ' are positive real numbers,\nσ' < ρ'.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic bijection between A_{σ,ρ} and A_{σ',ρ'} if and only if ρ/σ = ρ'/σ'.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each line in the assumption is a single condition on the parameters. The problem is the equivalence statement. The user is asking for a proof or reference for this fact.",
