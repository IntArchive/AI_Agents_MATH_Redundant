    "Content": "I am looking for a very concrete and simple example of a line bundle $L$ (on a curve or a surface) which is ample, but not very ample. I would also like that $L^{\\otimes k}$ is very ample for a small $k$, in the sense that I can do a very hands-on computation and show that, say, all degree $3$ monomials in certain global sections yield an immersion into projective space. Thanks a lot in advance!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Let me collect the comments into a CW answer. Others can then edit the answer to add their own favourites.) Here are a couple of simple examples, and one non-simple one. Note that  any line bundle of degree $\\geq 2g+1$ on a curve of genus $g$ is very ample, so any line bundle of positive degree on a curve is ample. The canonical bundle $K$ on a hyperelliptic curve of genus $\\geq 2$. Sections of $K$ define a 2:1 cover, so $K$ is globally generated and ample, but not very ample. On the other hand $K^2$ is very ample: for $g \\geq 3$ this is immediate by the above comment; for $g=2$ the argument is a little more involved (Hartshorne IV.3.1). Any bundle $L=O_C(p)$ where $p$ is a point on an elliptic curve $C$. Riemann—Roch shows that such a bundle has a 1-dimensional space of global sections, so is not very ample, or even globally generated, but it has positive degree, so is ample. On the other hand $L^3$ is very ample, and embeds $C$ into $\\mathbf{P}^2$ as a smoooth cubic, with $p$ mapping to a flex. If $C$ is a curve of genus $2$, and $p,q,r$ are general points on $C$, then the bundle $L=\\mathcal{O}_C(p+q-r)$$ is ample, but has no global sections at all. For a trickier example, one could consider a so-called Godeaux surface . This is a particular kind of surface of general type constructed as a quotient of a quintic surface in $\\mathbf{P}^3$. It has the property that the canonical bundle $K_S$ is ample, but has no global sections. For more details, see the excellent answer of Clay Cordova here . Sadly, in this case I don't know what power of $K$ is needed to obtain a very ample bundle.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants a simple example of an ample line bundle that's not very ample, and they want it to be concrete enough that they can compute things by hand, especially showing that some tensor power becomes very ample. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. Ample means that some positive power of the line bundle is very ample, right? So an ample line bundle isn't necessarily very ample itself, but some multiple of it is. Very ample means that the line bundle provides an embedding into projective space via its global sections.\n\nThe classic example I remember is the line bundle of degree 2 on a hyperelliptic curve. A hyperelliptic curve is a curve of genus at least 2 that can be expressed as a double cover of the projective line. The hyperelliptic line bundle, which has degree 2, is ample but not very ample because degree 2 isn't enough to embed a curve of genus ≥2. However, its square, which would be degree 4, is very ample. But wait, the user mentioned maybe a surface or a curve. Maybe a curve example is simpler.\n\nAlternatively, think about the projective line. But on P^1, any line bundle of positive degree is very ample, so that's not helpful. So maybe a curve of higher genus. Let's think of genus 1, an elliptic curve. On an elliptic curve, a divisor of degree 3 is very ample, but degree 2 is not. Wait, but for genus 1, a line bundle of degree 2 is actually very ample? Wait, no. For an elliptic curve, a divisor of degree 3 gives an embedding into P^2, but degree 2 would give a map to P^1, which is a double cover, hence not an embedding. So in that case, degree 2 is ample but not very ample, and degree 3 is very ample. So maybe that's a good example. Let me confirm.\n\nFor an elliptic curve E, let's say we take a divisor D of degree 2. Then the line bundle L=O(D) has h^0(L) = 2, by Riemann-Roch. So the linear system maps E to P^1, but since the degree is 2, the map is a 2-to-1 cover, hence not an embedding. Therefore, L is not very ample. However, since the curve is elliptic (genus 1), any line bundle of positive degree is ample. So L is ample but not very ample. Then L^{\\otimes 3} would be degree 6, but wait, maybe even L^{\\otimes 2} is degree 4. Wait, but in the case of an elliptic curve, actually, any line bundle of degree ≥3 is very ample. So if we take L of degree 2, then L^{\\otimes 2} is degree 4, which is very ample. So that fits the bill. The user wants L ample, not very ample, and L^2 or L^3 to be very ample with a small k.\n\nAlternatively, for a hyperelliptic curve of genus g ≥2, the canonical bundle is not very ample, but it's ample? Wait, the canonical bundle for hyperelliptic curves has degree 2g-2. For hyperelliptic curves, the canonical bundle is not very ample because the curve is hyperelliptic, so the canonical map factors through the hyperelliptic double cover. So maybe that's another example. But perhaps the elliptic curve example is simpler because genus 1 is easier to handle.\n\nWait, but in the case of elliptic curves, the canonical bundle is trivial, degree 0, so that's not helpful. So back to the degree 2 line bundle. Let me structure the problem.\n\nAssumption: Let E be an elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field. Let L be a line bundle on E of degree 2. Then L is ample (since it has positive degree) but not very ample. Then L^{\\otimes 3} would be of degree 6, which is very ample. Wait, but maybe even L^{\\otimes 2} is degree 4, which is very ample. Wait, for an elliptic curve, any line bundle of degree ≥3 is very ample. So if L is degree 2, then L^2 is degree 4, which is very ample. So in that case, k=2. So the example would be a line bundle of degree 2 on an elliptic curve. The user can compute the global sections and show that L^2 gives an embedding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is on a surface. For surfaces, perhaps considering the blow-up of P^2 at a point, and a certain line bundle there. But maybe that's more complicated. The user asked for a simple example, probably a curve is better.\n\nSo, putting this together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- E is an elliptic curve.\n- L is a line bundle on E.\n- L has degree 2.\n\nProblem: Show that L is ample but not very ample, and that L^{\\otimes k} is very ample for some small k (like k=2 or 3).\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify the surface or curve, so the user is asking for the example. So the formatted problem should extract the assumptions from the example. The original question says \"on a curve or a surface\", so the example can be either.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list the assumptions like the elliptic curve, the line bundle of degree 2, and then the problem is to show that it's ample but not very ample, and that its square is very ample.\n\nBut the user's original problem is asking for an example, not to prove something. Wait, but the format requires \"Problem: The problem\". The original question is asking for an example, but in the example given by the user, the problem is to prove something. So perhaps here, the formatted problem would be \"Provide a simple example of a line bundle L (on a curve or surface) which is ample but not very ample, and show that L^{\\otimes k} is very ample for a small k.\"\n\nBut the assistant needs to structure the problem as per the user's example. In the user's example, the original problem was to prove a divisibility, and the formatted problem listed the assumptions and restated the problem. So here, the original problem is asking for an example. However, according to the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes Assumption and Problem. So in this case, the assumptions would be the conditions of the example (like the line bundle is on an elliptic curve, degree 2, etc.), and the problem is to show that it's ample, not very ample, and that some power is very ample.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as looking for an example. However, the user's example transformed the original problem into assumptions and a problem statement. So in this case, perhaps the formatted problem would list the assumptions (the specific curve and line bundle) and then the problem is to show that L is ample but not very ample, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to provide such an example, so the assumptions would include the existence of such a curve and line bundle, but I think the user wants to structure the problem as per the example, which in their example included specific assumptions (like n is an integer divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions would be the setup of the example, like the line bundle is on a certain curve with certain properties, and then the problem is to show it's ample but not very ample, etc.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$E$ is an elliptic curve,\n$L$ is a line bundle on $E$,\n$\\deg(L) = 2$.\nProblem:\nShow that $L$ is ample but not very ample, and that $L^{\\otimes 2}$ is very ample.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the hyperelliptic curve example:\n\nAssumption:\n$C$ is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \\geq 2$,\n$L$ is a line bundle on $C$,\n$\\deg(L) = 2$.\nProblem:\nShow that $L$ is ample but not very ample, and that $L^{\\otimes 3}$ is very ample.\n\nBut maybe the hyperelliptic case requires more steps. The elliptic curve example might be simpler. The key is to choose an example where the line bundle is of low degree, hence not very ample, but becomes very ample upon taking a small tensor power.\n\nAnother example could be the line bundle O(1) on a rational ruled surface, but maybe that's more complex. The curve example is better.\n\nSo, finalizing, the assumptions would be the elliptic curve, line bundle of degree 2, and the problem is as stated.",
