    "Content": "Suppose $\\emptyset \\neq A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $.  Let $A = [\\,0,2).\\,\\,$   Prove that $\\sup A = 2$ This is my attempt: $A$ is the half open interval $[\\,0,2)$ and so all the $x_i \\in A$ look like $0 \\leq x_i < 2$ so clearly $2$ is an upper bound. To show it is the ${\\it least}$ upper bound, suppose that $2 \\neq \\sup A$, that is there exists a number $M < 2$ for some real $M$ qualifying as $\\sup A$.  Certainly this $M \\in [0,2) $ so $ M > 0 \\Rightarrow 2 -M > 0$. By the Archimedean Principle, for all real numbers $r > 0\\,\\, \\exists\\,\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $0 < \\frac{1}{n} < r $. By the Approximation Property of Suprema, there exists $a \\in [0,2)$ such that $\\sup A - \\epsilon < a \\leq \\sup A$, where $\\epsilon > 0$. Suppose $\\sup A = M < 2$.  Then the above gives $M - \\epsilon < a < 2\\,\\,\\,\\,\\forall \\epsilon > 0$.  Also, by Archimedean, we have $0 < \\frac{1}{n} < 2-M$, so choose $\\epsilon = 2-M$.  Then $M - (2-M) < a < 2 \\,\\Rightarrow 2(M-1) < a < 2$ We can assume $M - 1>0$ and so $2(M-1) > 2$  This results in a contradiction in the previous inequality.  Hence $M < 2$ cannot be the supremum. I realise there is probably a simpler way, but is what I have written all good?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think there's a way more simple and intuitive proof. First, as you observed, it is obvious that 2 is an upper bound. Now, to prove it is the supremum. Assume that $M$ is the supremum and $M<2$. Of course, $M>2$ is trivially impossible since $2$ is an upper bound as well and thus any $M$ bigger than $2$ cannot be a supremum. Now, let $x=\\frac{2-M}{2}+M$. As you can obviously see $M<x$, so all that is left is to show that $x<2$. But now, assume it is not, that is $x\\geq2$. Then, $\\frac{2-M}{2}+M\\geq2$. Multiplying both sides by $2$, we get $2-M+2M\\geq4$, that is $2+M\\geq4$. But $M<2$, so $2+M<4$. Thus, by reductio ad absurdum, $x<2$. This shows that $M<2$ cannot be the supremum. QED. Now, as for the simplicity of this proof, I have written a lot for clarity and in case you are a beginner on this subject. This can be summarized in $2$ lines, but this is for clarity. I hope this helps, and you must soon learn to find the shortest and more intuitive way. Good luck.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about proving that the supremum of the set A, which is the interval [0,2), is 2. They provided their own attempt and are asking if their reasoning is correct. But my task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the original question, filtering out any unnecessary details.\n\nFirst, the original problem states that A is a non-empty subset of real numbers, specifically the interval [0,2). The goal is to prove that sup A = 2. The user's attempt goes into showing that 2 is the least upper bound by contradiction, using the Archimedean principle and the approximation property.\n\nBut for formatting, I need to list all the assumptions. The assumptions here would be the properties of the set A and any conditions given. Let me parse that:\n\n- A is a non-empty subset of R (given as ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R). But in this specific case, A is defined as [0,2), so maybe the more precise assumption is that A is the interval [0,2). However, the general problem is about proving the supremum for this specific set.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R. Let A = [0,2). Prove that sup A = 2.\" So the problem starts by considering a non-empty subset A of R, then specifically defines A as [0,2). So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. A is a non-empty subset of R.\n2. A is equal to the interval [0,2).\n\nBut wait, since A is specifically given as [0,2), maybe the first assumption is redundant because the problem statement says \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R. Let A = [0,2).\" So perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- A is a subset of real numbers.\n- A is non-empty.\n- A is the interval [0,2).\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. So here, the set A has multiple properties. Let me check the example again. The example had:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each line is a separate condition. Applying that here, the set A is non-empty, it's a subset of R, and it's specifically [0,2). So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty subset of R,\nA is the interval [0,2).\n\nBut the problem statement starts with \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R. Let A = [0,2).\" So the first line is a general assumption (A is non-empty, subset of R), then specific definition (A = [0,2)). But in the example, the problem was restructured with the necessary assumptions. The original problem in the example had a condition that n is an integer, but the user added that n is divisible by 7 as an assumption. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which would actually change the problem. So perhaps there was a misunderstanding in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction based on the example provided, even if the example might have an error. \n\nBut in the current problem, the user is to structure the problem as in the example. So in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. That seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to have the assumptions listed as given in the problem, but maybe the example was a bad one. Wait, no. Let me read again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would make the problem \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7\". But the original problem was for all integers n. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants us to follow that structure, even if it's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the original problem had a typo. But perhaps I should proceed according to the user's example.\n\nWait, maybe in the original example, the problem was supposed to have n divisible by 7, but the user's original problem didn't state that. Hmm. This is confusing. But regardless, the instruction is to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the problem is about proving sup A = 2 where A is [0,2). The assumptions given in the problem are:\n\n- A is a non-empty subset of R (given as ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R)\n- A is the interval [0,2) (A = [0,2))\n\nSo those are the two assumptions. The problem is to prove sup A = 2.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R. Let A = [0,2). Prove that sup A = 2.\" So the first line is a general assumption (A is non-empty subset of R), but then A is specifically defined as [0,2). So perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A is a non-empty subset of R.\n2. A is the interval [0,2).\n\nThus, listing each assumption on a separate line. The problem is to prove that sup A = 2.\n\nBut perhaps the first assumption is redundant because once A is defined as [0,2), it's automatically non-empty and a subset of R. But the problem statement starts by saying \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R\", then defines A as [0,2). So maybe the user intended to include both. Alternatively, maybe just the interval [0,2) is the main assumption. However, to follow the example where even redundant assumptions were included (like n is integer, which was part of the original problem's statement), perhaps we should include both.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a non-empty subset of real numbers,\nA is the interval [0,2).\nProblem:\nProve that sup A = 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that once A is given as [0,2), it's already a non-empty subset of R, but the problem statement mentions \"Suppose ∅ ≠ A ⊂ R. Let A = [0,2).\" So the two assumptions are necessary. Therefore, the answer should list both.",
