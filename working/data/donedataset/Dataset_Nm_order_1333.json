    "Content": "\"Let $G$ be a group, and suppose $G=H \\cup K$, where $H$ and $K$ are subgroups.  Show that either $H=G$ or $K=G$.\" Let $h \\in H$ and $k \\in K$.  Then $hk \\in H$ or $hk \\in K$ (since every element of $G$ is in either $H$ or $K$).  If $hk=h'$ for some $h' \\in H$, then $k=h^{-1}h'$, so $k \\in H$.  If $hk=k'$ for some $k' \\in K$, then $h=k'k^{-1}$ so that $h \\in K$. If for all $h \\in H$ we have $h \\in K$, or if for all $k \\in K$ we have $k \\in H$, then $H \\subseteq K$ or $K \\subseteq H$.  Then since $G=H \\cup K$, we must have either $H=G$ or $K=G$. I'm not sure if the first paragraph of my 'proof' implies the second.  I've shown that for arbitrary $h \\in H$, $h \\in H$ and possibly $h \\in K$, and similar for $k \\in K$.  I don't know how to wrap it up (or perhaps this route won't lead anywhere at all). If this way won't work, I'd just like a hint on a new direction to take. Thanks.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. Then the problem is restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the original problem here: The question is about a group G that's the union of two subgroups H and K. The user wants to show that either H=G or K=G. The user's attempt tries to argue using elements h and k, showing that if hk is in H, then k is in H, and similarly for h in K. They then consider if all elements of H are in K or vice versa, leading to one subgroup being the whole group. But they're unsure if their initial steps lead to the conclusion and ask for help.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that G is a group, H and K are subgroups, and G is their union. Each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nK is a subgroup of G,\nG is the union of H and K.\n\nThen the problem is to show that either H=G or K=G.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"Show that either H=G or K=G.\" So the problem part is straightforward. The user's question includes their attempt, but for formatting, we need to ignore the user's proof attempt and just structure the problem as per the example. The example didn't include the user's attempt in the formatted problem, just the original question's core.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as above and the problem statement as given in the question. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an expression, and the formatted problem restated the problem with the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a group,\nH is a subgroup of G,\nK is a subgroup of G,\nG is equal to the union of H and K.\n\nProblem:\nShow that either H = G or K = G.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a single line, each addressing one condition. The problem is then restated. The user's own thoughts and their proof attempt are not part of the formatted problem, so they should be excluded. The key is to filter out unrelated information, like the user's uncertainty about their proof steps, and just present the core problem in the required structure.",
