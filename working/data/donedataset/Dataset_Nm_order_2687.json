    "Content": "Let $\\lambda\\vdash n$ be a partition of $n\\in\\mathbb N$ and $\\chi=\\chi_\\lambda$ the corresponding irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_n$. Denote by $\\lambda^t$ be the transpose of $\\lambda$ and $\\ell(\\lambda):=\\lambda^t_1$ the length of $\\lambda$. Let $\\tau\\in S_n$ be any transposition. In [R, Theorem 3.5] , the following formula is quoted:\n$$ \\binom n2 \\cdot \\frac{\\chi(\\tau)}{\\chi(1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\ell(\\lambda)} \\left( \\binom{\\lambda_i}2 - \\binom{\\lambda^t_i}2 \\right). $$ I would like to see a proof for this formula. Roichman refers to the paper [I] , which itself refers to a German paper by Frobenius, \"Über die Charaktere der symmetrischen Gruppe\" . I was unable to obtain a copy of said paper, but I believe this must somehow follow from the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule (or directly from the Frobenius character formula). Frankly, I have not invested a lot of time into an attempt to prove this myself because I was hoping that there is a more accessible and detailed reference for such an early formula. I would be very grateful if someone could provide such reference. Of course, if you happen to know a short proof, don't refrain from posting it.

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The paper Über die Charaktere der symmetrischen Gruppe by Frobenius is in the Sitzungsberichte der königlich preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin of $1900$, available at archive.org in various formats. It begins on p. $516$; the formula you cite seems to correspond to the last formula of the paper on p. $534$. The notation $f^{(\\kappa)}=\\chi^{(\\kappa)}_0$ is introduced on p. $522$, and $h_\\varrho=n!/(c(n-c)!)$ is introduced on p. $533$. I'm not sure though how the $a_i$ and $b_i$ are related to your $\\lambda_i$ and $\\lambda_i^t$. Let me know if you need any help with the German.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about a specific formula related to the character of a transposition in the symmetric group. They mention partitions, irreducible characters, and references to some papers by Roichman and Ingram. The main goal is to prove the given formula involving the character value over a transposition.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions from the problem. The user states that λ is a partition of n (so λ ⊢ n), χ is the corresponding irreducible character of S_n. The transpose of λ is λ^t, and ℓ(λ) is the length, which is λ^t_1. τ is any transposition in S_n. The formula involves binomial coefficients and a sum over the length of λ.\n\nThe assumptions would include that λ is a partition of n, χ is the irreducible character associated with λ, τ is a transposition in S_n, and the definition of ℓ(λ) as the first part of the transposed partition. Also, the formula itself is given, which the user wants to prove. The problem is to prove that formula, so I need to structure that as the Problem part. The references might not be necessary as assumptions but are part of the original question's context. I should filter those out since they are just background information.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions: Each line should be a single condition on one object. So λ being a partition of n, χ being the irreducible character corresponding to λ, τ being a transposition in S_n, ℓ(λ) defined as the first part of λ^t, etc. Each of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to prove the given equation. I need to make sure that all variables are covered and their conditions are listed. The user also mentions that they couldn't access Frobenius's paper but think it might relate to Murnaghan-Nakayama or Frobenius's formula. However, the problem as stated is just to prove the formula, so those are part of their thoughts but not assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions are about the objects involved in the formula.",
