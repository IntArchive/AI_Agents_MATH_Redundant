    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that there's a holomorphic function f around zero such that f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z). So, the main question is about the existence of a square root for the function 1 - cos(z) in a neighborhood of zero. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some complex analysis. For a function to have a holomorphic square root, certain conditions must be met. Generally, if a function g(z) is holomorphic and non-vanishing in a simply connected domain, then it has a holomorphic logarithm, and hence a holomorphic square root. But here, 1 - cos(z) does vanish at z = 0 because 1 - cos(0) = 0. So, that complicates things because log(0) isn't defined.\n\nWait, the user mentions that they thought it's not possible because at zero, 1 - cos(z) is zero, and log isn't defined there. But maybe there's a way around it. Let me think. The function 1 - cos(z) can be written as 2 sin²(z/2). So, 1 - cos(z) = 2 sin²(z/2). Then, sin(z/2) is holomorphic and has a zero at z = 0. So, sin(z/2) is z/2 - (z^3)/(48) + ... So, near zero, sin(z/2) is approximately z/2. Therefore, 1 - cos(z) ≈ 2*(z²/4) = z²/2. So, 1 - cos(z) behaves like z squared near zero. \n\nIf we take the square root of that, we might get something like z over sqrt(2), but that's multivalued. Wait, but maybe because the zero is of even order, we can define a holomorphic square root. Let me recall the theorem: If a holomorphic function g has a zero of even order at a point, then in some neighborhood of that point, g has a holomorphic square root. If the order is even, say 2m, then locally g(z) = (z - a)^{2m} h(z), where h(a) ≠ 0. Then the square root would be (z - a)^m sqrt(h(z)), and since h is non-vanishing, sqrt(h(z)) exists as a holomorphic function once we choose a branch. \n\nIn our case, 1 - cos(z) has a zero of order 2 at z = 0. Because the Taylor series of 1 - cos(z) around 0 is z²/2 - z^4/24 + ... So the lowest term is z², which is even. Therefore, according to the theorem, there exists a holomorphic square root in a neighborhood of zero. \n\nSo, the key point is that the zero at z=0 is of even order, allowing the square root to exist despite the function vanishing there. The user was concerned about the logarithm because they were thinking of expressing the square root as exp((1/2) log(1 - cos(z))). However, since 1 - cos(z) has a zero, log(1 - cos(z)) would indeed be problematic there. But the square root can exist even without the logarithm being defined globally because the zero's order allows a holomorphic function that squares to 1 - cos(z). \n\nTherefore, the answer should affirm that such a square root exists because 1 - cos(z) has a zero of even order at z=0, making it possible to define a holomorphic square root in a neighborhood of zero despite the function vanishing there. The problem with the logarithm approach is that it doesn't account for the even-order zero, which permits the square root without needing a logarithm in this case.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the required format. The original question is about when a complex function has a square root, specifically 1 - cos(z). The assumptions here are that f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero, and f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z). But the key conditions from the problem are the holomorphicity and the square relation. Wait, but in the example provided, the assumptions listed were about the variable n. In this case, the problem is about existence, so the assumptions might be about the function 1 - cos(z) having certain properties. But the user's original problem doesn't state assumptions; it's a direct question. However, the format requires listing assumptions line by line. \n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was about proving divisibility, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, maybe the example had an error. Wait, in the original problem, the user had \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem was different. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had more context. But regardless, the user's example shows that assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's conditions. \n\nIn the current problem, the problem is to show that 1 - cos(z) has a holomorphic square root near zero. The key assumptions here would be that f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of zero, and that f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z). But maybe the function 1 - cos(z) has a zero of even order at z=0, which is a crucial condition. So, perhaps the assumptions should list that 1 - cos(z) is holomorphic (which it is), and that it has a zero of even order at z=0. But the problem doesn't state these; they are part of the analysis. The problem as posed is: \"When does a complex function have a square root? I want to show that there is a holomorphic f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2=1−cos(z).\" So the problem is to show existence under the given conditions. The assumptions here are:\n\n1. f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero.\n2. f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Maybe here, the assumptions need to be the conditions given in the problem. However, the problem doesn't list assumptions; it's a direct question. So perhaps the correct approach is to list the conditions given in the problem. The problem says, \"there is a holomorphic f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2=1−cos(z)\". So the problem is to prove that such an f exists. Therefore, the assumptions are the properties that 1 - cos(z) must satisfy for such an f to exist. Since the user is asking when a complex function has a square root, and applying it to 1 - cos(z), perhaps the key assumption is that 1 - cos(z) has a zero of even order at z=0, which allows the square root to exist. But in the problem statement, the user hasn't explicitly stated that; they are asking to show existence. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be the given conditions in the problem. Since the problem is to show existence, the assumptions would be the properties of the function 1 - cos(z) and the requirements on f. But perhaps the original problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the function's definition. Maybe the answer requires the assumption that 1 - cos(z) is analytic (which it is) and that it has a zero of even order. But the problem is posed as a question, so perhaps the formatted problem should restate the problem as given, and the assumptions are the conditions given. \n\nWait, the example given by the user had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or perhaps the original problem was different. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and the formatted problem lists the assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to structure the problem as per the format, listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants to show that there exists a holomorphic f near zero such that f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z). So the problem is to prove the existence of such an f. The key points here are:\n\n- f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of 0.\n- f(z)² = 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut the problem is asking under what conditions this is possible. The user is missing some subtlety about the complex logarithm. The answer revolves around the function 1 - cos(z) having a zero of even order at 0, which allows a square root despite the logarithm issue. Therefore, the key assumption here is that 1 - cos(z) has a zero of even order at z=0. However, the problem as posed by the user does not explicitly state this assumption; it's part of the analysis. So in formatting the problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions in the problem. \n\nWait, the problem is: \"I want to show that there is a holomorphic f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2=1−cos(z).\" So the problem is to prove existence. The only assumption here is that f is holomorphic and satisfies f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z). But perhaps in the formatted problem, the assumptions are the conditions that must be satisfied for the problem to hold. In this case, the key condition is that 1 - cos(z) has a zero of even order at z=0, which allows the existence of the square root. However, this is not stated in the problem but is part of the reasoning. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of the given function. The given function is 1 - cos(z), which is entire (holomorphic everywhere), and it has a zero at z=0 of order 2. So the formatted problem's assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n1 - cos(z) is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero,\n1 - cos(z) has a zero of order 2 at z=0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a holomorphic function f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut in the original problem, the user didn't state these assumptions; they are inferred from the function's properties. However, the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had that condition. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. \n\nGiven that, maybe the correct approach is to list the assumptions as the given conditions in the problem. In the current problem, the user states: \"I want to show that there is a holomorphic f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2=1−cos(z).\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n- f is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero.\n- f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence. However, in the example, the formatted problem included assumptions beyond the original problem's statement (adding that n is divisible by 7), which might be a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem with its inherent assumptions. In this case, the inherent assumptions are that 1 - cos(z) is holomorphic and has a zero of even order at z=0. Therefore, the formatted problem would list these as assumptions. But the original problem didn't state these; they are part of the function's properties. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about existence, maybe the only assumption is that we are working in a neighborhood of zero where 1 - cos(z) is defined and holomorphic. But 1 - cos(z) is entire, so that's trivial. \n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the correct way is to list the conditions given in the problem. The user's problem states: \"there is a holomorphic f on a neighborhood of zero such that f(z)^2=1−cos(z)\". The task is to prove that. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of zero.\n- f(z)^2 = 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut the problem is to show existence, so these are more like the desired conclusions. Wait, no. The assumptions in the example were about the variable n. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Perhaps the user intended to modify the problem in the example, but that's unclear. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the safest way is to list the conditions given in the problem. The problem is to show that 1 - cos(z) has a square root that's holomorphic near zero. The key assumptions are:\n\n- 1 - cos(z) is a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of zero.\n- The function 1 - cos(z) has a zero at z=0.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the existence of the square root given these properties. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are more about the function's behavior. Since the key condition allowing the square root is the even order zero, maybe that should be listed as an assumption. However, the original problem doesn't state this; it's derived from the function's properties. \n\nIn the example, the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), which might indicate that the user wants to extract hidden assumptions. But that's risky. Given the instructions, perhaps the task is to structure the problem as given, filtering unrelated information. The original problem mentions wanting to define a branch of log(1 - cos(z)) but realizing it's not possible due to the zero. But the formatted problem should list the assumptions of the problem. \n\nSo, the problem as posed is to show that there's a holomorphic square root of 1 - cos(z) near zero. The assumptions here are:\n\n- f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of zero.\n- The square of f(z) equals 1 - cos(z).\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions could be the properties of 1 - cos(z). Given the example, perhaps the correct approach is to list the given conditions. Since the example seemed to erroneously add an assumption, maybe the current problem should list the function's properties as assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list the properties required for the existence of the square root. But since the problem is to show existence, the assumptions are the given conditions. \n\nAfter some confusion, I think the correct way is to structure the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n$f$ is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero,\n$f(z)^2 = 1 - \\cos(z)$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists a holomorphic function $f$ on a neighborhood of zero such that $f(z)^2 = 1 - \\cos(z)$.\n\nBut that seems redundant because the assumptions are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are about the function 1 - cos(z), like it being holomorphic and having an even-order zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to determine when a complex function has a square root, and the specific case is 1 - cos(z). So the general question is about the conditions for a complex function to have a square root, and the specific problem is about 1 - cos(z). In that case, the assumptions for the specific problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 - \\cos(z)$ is holomorphic on a neighborhood of zero,\n$1 - \\cos(z)$ has a zero of order 2 at $z = 0$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that there exists a holomorphic function $f$ on a neighborhood of zero such that $f(z)^2 = 1 - \\cos(z)$.\n\nThis makes sense because the assumptions are the properties of 1 - cos(z) that allow the square root to exist. The even-order zero is the key condition here. So, in the formatted problem, listing these as assumptions would be appropriate.",
