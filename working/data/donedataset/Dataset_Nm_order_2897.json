    "Content": "I am supposed to teach undergraduate students who do not major in mathematics and I would like to give them a short introduction to mathematical reasoning and to the concept of proof . I am looking for very simple mathematical statements (true or false) to help them get familiar with logic and proof writing. I am not sure if what I ask is clear, so here are some ideas I came up with: Let $n$ be an integer. If $n$ is a multiple of $42$, then $n$ is even. Let $n$ be an integer. If $n$ is a multiple of $43$, then $n$ is odd. If $x$ is a positive real number, then $x^2 \\geq x$. For all $n \\in \\Bbb Z$, $n$ is even iff $n^2$ is even. There is no $x \\in \\Bbb Q$ such that $x^2 = 2$. There exist irrational numbers $\\alpha,\\beta > 0$ such that $\\alpha^\\beta$ is rational. For all $x \\in \\Bbb R$, if [for all $\\epsilon > 0$, $|x| < \\epsilon$], then $x = 0$. There exists $m \\in \\Bbb Z$ such that, for all $n \\in \\Bbb Z$, one has $n \\leq m$. $(-1)\\times (-1) = 1$ For all $x \\in \\Bbb R$, one has $0\\times x = 0$. (proposed by Robert Auffarth) Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $x$ is real and $x^n=0$ then $x = 0$. (ibidem) Suppose $b,d \\neq 0$ and $\\dfrac{a}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{d}$. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b} + \\dfrac{c}{d} = \\dfrac{a+c}{b+d}$. It would be great to cover different type of statements.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I left the following exercises for a maths education calculus class --- mainly to test their knowledge of the definitions actually. A few soft questions and maybe more material covered than what you are talking about but many are good proof-writing exercises. EDIT: I have added some more calculus problems after 36... this time without italics. $\\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbb{R}}$ $\\newcommand{\\raw}{\\rightarrow}$ $\\newcommand{\\N}{\\mathbb{N}}$ $\\newcommand{\\Q}{\\mathbb{Q}}$ $\\newcommand{\\Raw}{\\Rightarrow}$ Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ and define a function $g:\\R\\raw\\R$ by $g(x)=1/f(x)$. Prove that $g$ has no roots . Let $n\\in\\N$ and $f:\\R\\raw\\R$. Prove that $k$ is a root of $[f(x)]^n$ if and only if $k$ is a root of $f$. Let $f:\\R\\raw\\R$. Prove that if $k$ is a root of $f$, then $0$ is a root of $f(x+k)$. Prove that the product of two even functions is an even function. Prove that the composition of two even functions is an even function. Use the unit circle to  prove that the cosine function is an even function. Prove that the product of two odd functions is an even function. Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ is an odd function defined on the entire real line. Prove that $f$ has a root. Using the fact that sine is an odd function, prove that the tangent function is odd . Prove that $g:\\R\\raw\\R$, defined by $g(x)=-x$ is decreasing . Give an example of a function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ which is both increasing and decreasing for all $x\\in\\R$. Give an example of a function that is strictly increasing for all $x\\in\\R$ but has no roots. Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ is strictly increasing on a non-empty closed interval $[a,b]\\subset\\R$. Show that if $a\\leq x_1<x_2\\leq b$, then the (secant) line joining $(x_1,f(x_1))$ to $(x_2,f(x_2))$ has positive slope. Suppose that $g:\\R\\raw\\R$ is strictly decreasing and has a root at $a\\in\\R$. Prove that $g$ has no other roots. Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ is a positive increasing function and that $g:\\R\\raw\\R$ is a positive decreasing function. Prove that $q=f/g$, $q(x)=f(x)/g(x)$ is an increasing function. Use the formula for the roots of a quadratic function $p(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ to find an expression for the sum of the roots of $p$; and the product of the roots of $p$. Suppose that $q(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is a quadratic function with real roots $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Use the fact that quadratic functions are symmetric about the line $x=-b/2a$ --- and that  their maxima/ minima are found there to find an expression for $\\alpha+\\beta$. Let $r(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ be a quadratic function. Use the factor theorem to find an expression for the sum of the roots of $r$; and the product of the roots of $r$. Prove that all polynomials of odd degree have at least one root. Prove the factor theorem for the polynomial $c(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$. Give an example of degree $4$ polynomials $p$ and $q$ such that $p+q$ is a polynomial of degree $3$. Suppose that $p$ and $q$ are polynomials and let $r$ be the rational function defined by $r(x)=p(x)/q(x)$. Prove that if $k$ is a root of $r$ then $k$ is a root of $p$. By finding a counterexample, show that the converse does not hold. Suppose that $p$ and $q$ are polynomials and let $r$ be the rational function $r(x)=p(x)/q(x)$. If $q(a)=0$, then $r(a)$ is not defined at $a$ and hence discontinuous at $a$. Find examples of polynomials $p$ and $q$ such that: (a) $r$ is continuous, and (b) $r$ is not continuous---but is bounded (there exists a positive number $M>0$ such that $|r(x)|<M$ for all $x\\in\\R$). Prove that $|x^2+1|=x^2+1$ for all $x\\in\\R$. Prove that the absolute value function is even. Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw \\R$ has the property that $f(x)<0$ for all $x\\in\\R$. Describe the relationship between the graph of $f(x)$  and the graph of $|f(x)|$. Let $k\\in\\R$ be a constant and $a\\in\\R$. Use the $\\varepsilon-\\delta$ definition of a limit to prove that\n$$\\lim_{x\\raw a}k=k\\text{, and }\\lim_{x\\raw a}x=a.$$ Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ and\n$$\\lim_{x\\raw 1}f(x)=0.$$\nDoes this imply that $1$ is a root of $f$? Show that there are two values of $a\\in\\R$ such that the left- and right-handed limits of $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ at $x=1$ agree where:\n$$f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}(ax)^2 & \\text{ if }x<1\n    \\\\ ax+6 & \\text{ if }x\\geq 1\\end{array}\\right.$$\nProduce a rough sketch of $f$ in each case. Assuming we know what $2^x$ is, we can define a function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ by:\n$$f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+2^{-1/x}}$$\nSketch an argument that suggests that the left- and right-hand limits of $f(x)$ at $0$ are, respectively, $0$ and $1$. Construct a function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ such that\n$$\\lim_{x\\raw0^-}f(x)=+\\infty\\text{ , and }\\lim_{x\\raw 0^+}f(x)=1.$$ Suppose that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ and that\n$$\\forall\\varepsilon>0,\\,\\exists\\,\\delta>0\\text{ such that if }0<|x|<\\delta\\Rightarrow|f(x)|<\\varepsilon.$$\nDoes this imply that\n$$\\lim_{x\\raw 0}f(x)=0.$$ For all real numbers $x,\\,y\\in\\R$ with $x\\neq y$, there exists a fraction between $x$ and $y$ --- i.e. a $q\\in(x,y)$.  Consider the function\n$$f(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}1&\\text{ if }x\\in\\Q\n\\\\0 & \\text{ if }x\\not\\in\\Q\\end{array}\\right.$$\nProve that $f$ is not continuous at any point. Consider the function\n$$g(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}x&\\text{ if }x\\in\\Q\n\\\\0 & \\text{ if }x\\not\\in\\Q\\end{array}\\right.$$\nProve that $g$ is continuous at $0$. Suppose that functions $f_1:\\R\\raw \\R$ and $f_2:\\R\\raw\\R$ have the property that, for $i=1,2$\n$$f_i(x)=f_i(y)\\Raw x=y.$$\nProve that $f=f_1\\circ f_2$ has this property also. Find a set $A\\subseteq\\R$, and functions $f:A\\raw\\R$ and $g:\\R\\raw \\R$ such that $(g\\circ f)(x)=x$ for all $x\\in A$ but that there exists a $y\\in \\R$ such that $(f\\circ g)(y)\\neq y$. Suppose that $f:[0,1]\\raw[0,1]$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $[0,1]$ such that $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$. Suppose further that $g:[0,1]\\raw[0,1]$ is a  function such that\n$$(g\\circ f)(x)=x$$\nfor all $x\\in[0,1]$. How is the graph of $g$ related  to the graph of $f$. Prove that a continuous function is  continuous on any non-empty closed interval $[a,b]\\subset \\R$. Construct a function which is not continuous (everywhere) but is  {continuous on} $[0,1]$. The singleton set $\\{x\\}\\subset\\R$ is equal to the closed interval $[x,x]$. Verify that all the conclusions of the  Intermediate Value Theorem hold when $f:\\{x\\}\\raw\\R$ is a  continuous function got by restricting a continuous function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ to $\\{x\\}$. Find  {ALL} such continuous functions $\\{x\\}\\raw\\R$. Prove that the  Mean Value Theorem holds on any non-empty closed interval for a smooth function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$. Find the  local maxima and minima of the constant function $f(x)=0$. Show that $f:\\R\\raw\\R$, $f(x)=x^4+12x^3+54x^2-12x+5$ is  concave up on $\\R$. Prove that $\\tan x$ has a  vertical asymptote at $x=\\pi/2$. Give an example of a function which is  continuous on $(0,1]$ but not  on $[0,1]$. Use the  Intermediate Value Theorem to prove that $\\sqrt{2}\\in\\R$ exists. Use the  Intermediate Value Theorem to prove that if $f:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ and $g:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ are continuous functions such that $f(a)=g(b)$ and $f(b)=g(a)$, then there exists a point $c\\in[a,b]$ such that $f(c)=g(c)$. It can be shown that a continuous function obtains its  absolute maximum and minimum on finite unions of closed intervals. Consider the set $S$ defined by:\n\\begin{align*}\n    S&=[0,2\\pi]\\cup\\left[2\\pi,2\\pi+\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\right]\\cup\\left[3\\pi,3\\pi+\\frac{1}{3\\pi}\\right]\\cup\\left[4\\pi,4+\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\right]\\cup\\cdots\\cup\\left[100\\pi,100\\pi+\\frac{1}{100\\pi}\\right],\n    \\\\ &=[0,2\\pi]\\cup\\left(\\bigcup_{i=2}^{100}\\left[i\\pi,i\\pi+\\frac{1}{i\\pi}\\right]\\right).\n    \\end{align*}\nFind the absolute maxima and minima of $\\sin:S\\raw\\R$. If $f:(a,b)\\raw\\R$ is a smooth function such that $f'=0$ for all $x\\in(a,b)$ then $f$ is constant on $(a,b)$. Find an example of a differentiable function $g:\\R\\raw\\R$ such that\n$$\\lim_{x\\raw\\infty}g'(x)=0\\text{ , but}\\lim_{x\\raw\\infty}g(x)$$\nis not a constant. Sketch continuous functions $f_i:[0,1]\\raw\\R$ for $i=1,2,3,4,\\dots$ such that $f_i$ has $i$ stationary points; i.e. solutions to $f'(c)=0$ for $c\\in(0,1)$. Is it possible for a function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ to have a  local maximum/ minimum at a point $a\\in\\R$ where $f$ is discontinuous?. In the proof of the  Closed Interval Method, we make the assumption that $f:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ is continuous. Is this assumption necessary?. Let $\\varepsilon\\in (0,1)$ be a constant. Using algebraic techniques, find the\n             critical points of $f:[0,1]\\raw\\R$\n            $$f(x):=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}0 & \\text{ if }-1\\leq x<-\\varepsilon\n                \\\\[1.5ex]\\ \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}x+1 & \\text{ if }-\\varepsilon\\leq x<0\n                \\\\[1.5ex] -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}x+1 & \\text{ if }0\\leq x<\\varepsilon\n                \\\\[1.5ex] 0 &\\text{ if }\\varepsilon\\leq x\\leq 1\n                \\end{array}\\right.$$ Construct a function $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ that is  twice differentiable but not  three-times differentiable. Show that\n$$\\lim_{h\\raw0}\\frac{\\cos(\\pi+h)-\\cos(\\pi)}{h}=0.$$\nShow that if $f:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ is  twice differentiable, there exists a point $c\\in(a,b)$ such that\n$$f''(c)=\\frac{f'(b)-f'(a)}{b-a}$$ Suppose that a smooth function $f:[-1,1]\\raw\\R$ is  concave down on $[-1,1]$ and further that $f'(0)=0$. Draw a sketch suggesting that $f$ attains its absolute maximum at $0$. Use the geometric definition of  concavity to show that $f(x)=|x|$ is  concave up on $\\R$. Show that $|x|$ is an  asymptotic of $\\sqrt{x^2+3}$. Explain why there is no polynomial  asymptotic of $\\sin x$. Find all  vertical asymptotes of $f(x)=\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. Use the  Intermediate Value Theorem to prove that if $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow[0,1]$ is a continuous function, then $f$ has a  fixed point; i.e. a point $x\\in[0,1]$ such that $f(x)=x$. Suppose that $f:[a,b]\\raw \\R$ is a differentiable function such that $f'(x)\\leq K$ for all $x\\in[a,b]$. Prove that $f(a)+K(b-a)$ is an upper bound for the {absolute maximum of $f$ on $[a,b]$} [HINT: Assume that $f(x)>f(a)+K(b-a)$ for some $x\\in[a,b]$ and show that this contradicts the  Mean Value Theorem.]. Call a non-empty set of points $\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}\\subset\\R$ an  antipodal set for $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ if the tangents to $f$ at $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n$ are all parallel. Prove that an antipodal sets of a cubic function contain at most two elements. Verify  Rolles's Theorem for $\\sin:[0,\\pi]\\raw\\R$ geometrically by considering the unit circle with parametric equation $(x,y)=(\\cos\\theta,\\sin\\theta)$. Let $[a,b]$ be a non-empty closed interval and consider $\\sin:[a,b]\\raw\\R$. Explain why $\\sin$ satisfies the hypothesis of the  Mean Value Theorem. Apply the Mean Value Theorem to show that there exists an $x\\in(a,b)$ such that\n        $$|\\cos(x)|=\\left|\\frac{\\sin(b)-\\sin(a)}{b-a}\\right|.$$\nNow use this result to show that for any $x_1,\\,x_2\\in \\R$\n$$|\\sin (x_2)-\\sin(x_1)|\\leq |x_2-x_1|.$$\nWe could then use this result to prove that $\\sin$ is a continuous function. What would be wrong with the proof? In this exercise we see why we might call the quantity\n $$\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$\n the  average slope across $[a,b]$ when we talk about the  Mean Value Theorem. Let $f:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ be a differentiable function. Partition the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ equally spaced points:\n$$a=:x_0<x_1<x_2<\\cdots x_n:=b.$$\nIf $[a,b]$ is divided into $n$ sub-intervals then each will have width $h=(b-a)/n$ ---\nso that $x_i=a+ih$. Produce a sketch of a smooth function $f:[a,b]\\raw\\R$ and a partition of $[a,b]$. Now for large $n$, and hence intervals of small length,  smooth curves look like lines so approximate the slope of $f$ on the interval $[x_{i-1},x_{i}]$ by the secant line joining $(x_{i-1},f(x_{i-1}))$ to $(x_{i},f(x_{i}))$ (a sketch should help):\n$$f'(x)\\approx \\frac{f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})}{h}\\,\\text{ , for }x\\in[x_{i-1},x_i].$$\nNow average over all of the $n$ sub-intervals:\n$$\\text{average}(f')\\approx\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\frac{f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})}{h}\\right)}{n}.$$\nNow use the relationship between $a,\\,b,\\,n$ and $h$ and telescoping series techniques(see Wikipedia) to show that\n$$\\text{average}(f')\\approx \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.$$\nTo make this interpretation precise --- by taking $n\\raw\\infty$ --- we actually have to use the  Mean Value Theorem! More of this in Integration. Argue that if $f:\\R\\raw\\R$ is a smooth, even function such that the only solution to $f'(x)=0$ is $x=0$, then $x=0$ cannot be a  saddle point (a point $a\\in\\R$ such that $f'(a)=0$ but $a$ is not a local maxima or minima). Suppose there is a  {local maximum} at $x=0$. Explain why this is an absolute maximum for $f$ on $\\R$. Construct a function with  vertical asymptotes at $x=0,1,2,3,4,4,\\dots,10^6$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about finding simple mathematical statements to teach proof-writing. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be separated.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user listed several statements, each of which is a separate problem. But the task is to structure each of these as individual problems following the format. However, the example given only structures one problem. Wait, looking back, the example the user provided was for one specific problem (the A(n) divisible by 91), so maybe each statement in the question should be formatted separately. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\" (singular) as the following format. The original question on Math SE includes multiple example statements. So perhaps the task is to process each of these statements as separate problems?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the entire post is a single problem, but the actual problem is the user's list of statements. But in the example, they took a single problem (about A(n) divisible by 91) and listed assumptions and the problem. Here, the original post is asking for simple statements to teach proof-writing, and the user (the professor) is supposed to structure each of these statements as separate problems. But in the example, the original problem was one statement, so maybe each of the statements in the question should be formatted as individual problems.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem. The user's instruction says to \"structure that problem\" (singular). Therefore, perhaps the entire post is considered a single problem, but the problem is the collection of statements. However, the example given was a single problem. Therefore, maybe the task is to take each of the statements listed in the original question and format them individually. But the user's answer in the example did not do that; they took one problem. Hmm, perhaps the original post's question is the problem, and the examples within it are just examples. Wait, the original problem's title is about \"n is even iff n^2 is even\" and other statements. The user is supposed to structure the problem as per the format, filtering unrelated info.\n\nLooking at the example, the user's original problem had a title and a question, and the formatted version extracted the assumptions and the problem. In the provided example, the original problem had an expression A(n) with conditions on n, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and n divisible by 7, then the problem statement.\n\nSo, applying that to the current problem. The Math SE question's title is: \"n is even iff n^2 is even\" and other simple statements to teach proof-writing. The question body lists several statements as examples. The task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem as per the format.\n\nBut the user's answer example took one problem. However, the current problem includes multiple statements. The user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the entire question is considered the \"problem\" to be structured, but the original question is asking for examples of statements. Wait, no. The actual problem is the list of statements provided in the question. However, the original question is a request for help in finding such statements. But the user wants to structure the problem (i.e., each of the statements) into the format. Wait, perhaps each of the statements in the question is a separate problem to be formatted. The example given was one problem, so maybe each of the statements in the original question should be structured as individual problems.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem. But the original post contains multiple problems. So perhaps the task is to process each of them as separate problems. However, the example given by the user shows one problem. Therefore, maybe the answer should present each of the statements in the original question as separate formatted problems.\n\nLooking at the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions and the problem. For each of the statements in the original question, I need to extract assumptions and the problem. For example, take the first statement: \"Let n be an integer. If n is a multiple of 42, then n is even.\" Here, the assumptions would be \"n is an integer\", \"n is a multiple of 42\", and the problem is to prove that n is even. Similarly for each statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list each statement from the original question as a separate formatted problem. But the user's example only formatted one problem. Given that, perhaps the user expects each of the statements to be formatted as separate entries. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\", implying that each problem in the original post is to be formatted. Therefore, the final answer should have multiple formatted problems, each corresponding to a statement in the original question.\n\nBut the problem is that the user's example only formatted one. However, given the context, perhaps the user expects each of the statements in the original question to be formatted as separate entries. So the answer would be a list of formatted problems. However, the user's answer example didn't do that. Wait, looking at the example again: the original problem was a single problem, and the formatted version had assumptions and problem. In the current case, the original question is a list of problems, so the answer should be a list of formatted problems.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to output the answer in the specified format. The user's example had a single formatted problem. However, the current problem has multiple statements. Therefore, perhaps each statement should be formatted as a separate problem. Let's proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, for each statement in the original question, extract assumptions and problem.\n\nLet me go through each statement:\n\n1. Let $n$ be an integer. If $n$ is a multiple of 42, then $n$ is even.\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is a multiple of 42.\nProblem: Prove that n is even.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions are split into separate lines. So for this statement:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is a multiple of 42.\nProblem: Prove that $n$ is even.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove the implication. The actual problem statement is \"If n is a multiple of 42, then n is even.\" So perhaps the problem should be stated as that implication, with assumptions being n is an integer. Wait, because the statement is \"Let n be an integer. If n is a multiple of 42, then n is even.\" So the assumptions are n is an integer. Then the problem is to prove that if n is a multiple of 42, then n is even.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So the assumptions included both n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So in the example, the problem statement had two assumptions: n is integer and n divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nTherefore, in this case, for each statement, the assumptions are the given conditions in the statement, and the problem is the conclusion. So for the first statement:\n\nOriginal statement: Let n be an integer. If n is a multiple of 42, then n is even.\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is an integer,\n- n is a multiple of 42.\n\nProblem: Prove that n is even.\n\nWait, but the conclusion is \"then n is even.\" So the problem is to prove that under the assumptions (n integer and n multiple of 42), n is even.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was structured as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", given assumptions that n is integer and divisible by 7. So following that structure, for the first statement:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nAssumption: n is a multiple of 42.\nProblem: Prove that n is even.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, the second statement: Let n be an integer. If n is a multiple of 43, then n is odd.\n\nAssumptions: n is an integer, n is a multiple of 43.\nProblem: Prove that n is odd.\n\nThird statement: If x is a positive real number, then x² ≥ x.\n\nAssumptions: x is a positive real number.\nProblem: Prove that x² ≥ x.\n\nFourth: For all n ∈ Z, n is even iff n² is even.\n\nHere, the problem is to prove the equivalence. The assumption is n is an integer.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\nProblem: Prove that n is even if and only if n² is even.\n\nFifth: There is no x ∈ Q such that x² = 2.\n\nAssumption: None (universal statement about rationals).\nProblem: Prove that there is no rational number x with x² = 2.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions must be about one object. However, this is a statement about nonexistence. So perhaps no assumptions, and the problem is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, if considering x is a rational number, then the assumption would be x ∈ Q, and the problem is to prove that x² ≠ 2.\n\nBut the original statement is \"There is no x ∈ Q such that x² = 2.\" So structuring it:\n\nAssumption: x is a rational number.\nProblem: Prove that x² ≠ 2.\n\nWait, but the original is \"there is no x...\", which is equivalent to \"for all x ∈ Q, x² ≠ 2.\" So the problem is to prove that for all x ∈ Q, x² ≠ 2. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: x is a rational number.\nProblem: Prove that x² ≠ 2.\n\nYes.\n\nNext statement: There exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nAssumptions: α and β are positive irrational numbers.\nProblem: Prove that α^β is rational.\n\nBut the problem is to prove existence, so the statement is to show existence. So the problem is \"Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\" But in the format, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. However, since it's an existence statement, maybe the assumptions are not about specific α and β but rather the problem is to find such α and β. Hmm, this might be tricky. The example given in the user's problem had assumptions applied to one object. But in this case, it's an existence statement. Maybe no assumptions, and the problem is as stated. But according to the format, assumptions should list conditions on the objects. Since it's an existence proof, perhaps the problem is stated as is, with no assumptions.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement includes the mathematical expression. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: None (or not applicable)\nProblem: Prove that there exist positive irrational numbers α and β such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions are required. If no assumptions, maybe we can structure it as:\n\nAssumption: α and β are positive real numbers.\nProblem: Prove that α and β can be chosen to be irrational such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut this might not fit. Alternatively, the original problem is just the statement, so the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: None\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut the format requires assumptions. Hmm. In the user's example, the assumptions were about n. For this problem, since it's about existence, perhaps there are no specific assumptions on α and β, so maybe no assumptions. But the format might require at least one assumption. Alternatively, since α and β are irrational and positive, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: α is a positive irrational number,\nβ is a positive irrational number.\nProblem: Prove that α^β is rational.\n\nBut that's not correct because the problem is to show that such α and β exist. So the problem is to prove the existence, which doesn't fit into the assumption-problem structure as before. Therefore, perhaps this statement cannot be structured in the same way. Alternatively, maybe it's acceptable to have no assumptions and state the problem as is.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions. So maybe for this problem, we need to rephrase it as:\n\nProblem: Prove that there exist positive irrational numbers α and β such that α^β is rational.\n\nAssumption: None.\n\nBut the format requires assumptions. Wait, the original example had two assumptions about n. If there are no assumptions, perhaps the assumption section is empty. But the user's example didn't have that. Hmm. Maybe in cases where the problem is a universal statement or existence statement without prior conditions, we can omit assumptions or state \"None\". But according to the user's example, assumptions are listed. So for the statement \"There is no x ∈ Q such that x² = 2\", the assumption is x ∈ Q, and the problem is to prove x² ≠ 2. Similarly, for the existence statement, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: α and β are positive real numbers.\nProblem: Prove that α and β can be irrational numbers such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut this feels forced. Alternatively, the problem is as stated, and the assumption is that α and β are irrational, but the problem is to show that their power is rational. Wait, but the existence requires finding specific α and β. Maybe the problem is better stated as:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions are required. So maybe the assumption is that α and β are irrational, but that's part of the conclusion. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe this particular statement doesn't fit the format well. Alternatively, the problem can be structured as:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that there exist positive irrational numbers α and β such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed even if they are part of the hypothesis. So perhaps for existence statements, we might need to adjust. Alternatively, maybe it's better to skip such statements if they don't fit. But since the user included them in their original question, we need to find a way.\n\nAlternatively, take the problem as: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational. Since there are no prior assumptions given in the statement, maybe the assumptions are None. But the format requires assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the answer for this problem is:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut the user's example didn't have \"None\" in assumptions; it had specific assumptions. However, if the problem is a general statement without specific conditions on the variables, maybe the assumptions section is left blank. But the user's format requires the assumption section. In the example, the assumption section had two points. For this case, maybe the assumption is that α and β are positive real numbers. Then the problem is to show they can be chosen to be irrational with α^β rational.\n\nBut the original statement says \"There exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\" So the assumptions would be that α and β are positive irrational numbers, but the problem is to show that their power is rational. But that's not correct because the existence is the main point. This is tricky.\n\nPerhaps for existence statements, the format isn't a perfect fit, but we can structure it as:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that there exist positive irrational numbers α and β such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut I'll proceed with that, even if the assumption section is empty. Alternatively, if the system requires assumptions, maybe we can note that there are no specific assumptions beyond the universal set (like α and β being real numbers). But I think the user's example didn't include such implicit assumptions. For example, in the statement about x being a positive real number and x² ≥ x, the assumption is x is a positive real number, and the problem is to prove x² ≥ x. So for the existence statement, since there are no prior conditions, maybe the assumption is None. But according to the user's format, it's required to list assumptions. If forced, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: α and β are real numbers.\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nBut this is not accurate because the assumption is part of the problem statement. Hmm. Maybe it's better to leave assumptions empty. However, according to the user's example, even if the problem is about integers, the assumption is listed. So in the example, the problem was about n being an integer, and that was listed as an assumption. Therefore, following that, for the existence problem, since α and β are positive irrationals, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: α and β are positive irrational numbers.\nProblem: Prove that α^β is rational.\n\nBut this is not correct because the problem is to show the existence of such α and β, not to take arbitrary irrationals and prove their power is rational. This seems incorrect. Therefore, perhaps this particular statement doesn't fit the assumption-problem format well, and maybe the user intended for such statements to be structured differently. Alternatively, the problem is to prove the existence, which doesn't require assumptions on α and β, so the assumption section is empty, and the problem is as stated. But since the format requires assumptions, perhaps it's better to omit such statements or adjust them. However, since the user included them, I'll proceed with:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that there exist irrational numbers α, β > 0 such that α^β is rational.\n\nMoving on to the next statement: For all x ∈ R, if [for all ε > 0, |x| < ε], then x = 0.\n\nAssumption: x is a real number,\nFor all ε > 0, |x| < ε.\nProblem: Prove that x = 0.\n\nNext: There exists m ∈ Z such that, for all n ∈ Z, n ≤ m.\n\nAssumption: m and n are integers.\nProblem: Prove that there exists an integer m such that for all integers n, n ≤ m.\n\nBut the problem here is to prove the existence of a greatest integer, which is false. So the problem is to determine whether this statement is true or false, but the original question is to provide statements (true or false) for students to practice. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: m and n are integers.\nProblem: Prove or disprove that there exists an integer m such that for all integers n, n ≤ m.\n\nBut according to the original question, the statements can be true or false. However, the user's example had a problem to prove. So perhaps the problem is as stated, and the students have to prove or disprove. But in the format, the problem is to \"Prove that...\". So maybe the problem should be \"Prove or disprove...\", but the example had \"Prove that\". Therefore, maybe the problem is stated as is, and the answer will determine if it's true or false. But the formatted problem should present it as a statement to be proven, regardless of its truth value.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: m and n are integers.\nProblem: Prove that there exists an integer m such that for all integers n, n ≤ m.\n\nNext: (-1) × (-1) = 1.\n\nThis is a straightforward statement. Assumptions: None, since it's a specific equation. Problem: Prove that (-1) × (-1) = 1.\n\nBut according to the format, assumptions are required. However, there are no assumptions here. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: None.\nProblem: Prove that (-1) × (-1) = 1.\n\nNext: For all x ∈ R, 0 × x = 0.\n\nAssumption: x is a real number.\nProblem: Prove that 0 × x = 0.\n\nNext: Let n be a positive integer. If x is real and x^n = 0, then x = 0.\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer,\nx is a real number,\nx^n = 0.\nProblem: Prove that x = 0.\n\nLastly: Suppose b,d ≠ 0 and a/b = c/d. Then a/b + c/d = (a + c)/(b + d).\n\nAssumption: b and d are non-zero,\na/b = c/d.\nProblem: Prove that a/b + c/d = (a + c)/(b + d).\n\nNow, compiling all these formatted problems. However, the user's example only formatted one problem. But according to the instructions, we need to structure the given problem (the entire Math SE question) into the format. However, the original question is a request for simple statements, and the user provided several. So perhaps the answer should list all these statements formatted according to the example.\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one. However, given the context, I think the intended answer is to format each of the statements in the original question into separate assumption-problem entries. Therefore, the final answer will be multiple formatted problems, each adhering to the ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying one problem. However, the original post contains multiple problems. This is ambiguous, but the example shows formatting one problem. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to pick one of the statements and format it. But the user's original question includes multiple statements, and the example provided in the question includes multiple formatted problems. Wait, the user's example had only one formatted problem. Therefore, perhaps the task is to pick each of the statements and format them as separate problems, each in the specified format.\n\nBut given that the user wants the answer in the specified format, and the example shows a single formatted problem, but the current case has multiple statements, I need to check if the user expects all of them to be formatted. Looking back at the user's instruction: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" The example was one problem. The current task is to read the Math SE question, filter unrelated info, and structure that problem. The Math SE question is asking for examples of statements, and the user lists several. So perhaps the task is to structure each of those example statements as separate problems in the specified format.\n\nHowever, given that the user's example had a single problem, but the current case has multiple, perhaps the answer should present each of them in the format, separated appropriately. But the user's example used markdown formatting with ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT### etc. So perhaps each of the statements is formatted within the same answer, each under ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the formatted problem is under ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###, so perhaps each statement should be formatted individually. However, the original answer here is expected to be a single response. Therefore, perhaps the answer should list all the formatted problems consecutively, each adhering to the format.\n\nBut considering that the original answer must follow the specified format, and the user's example had one, I need to clarify. The user's instruction says: \"Act as a knowledgeable, and bilingual (Vietnamese and English) mathematics professor. Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the task is to take the given Math SE question and structure \"that problem\" (the problem presented in the Math SE question) into the format. But the Math SE question is a request for examples, and the examples are provided within the question. Therefore, the actual problems to be structured are the example statements provided in the question. Therefore, each of those example statements should be structured into the format.\n\nTherefore, the final answer will be multiple formatted problems, each in the specified format. However, the user's example shows a single formatted problem, but the instructions don't prohibit multiple. Therefore, I will proceed to structure each of the statements in the original question into the specified format, listing them all.",
