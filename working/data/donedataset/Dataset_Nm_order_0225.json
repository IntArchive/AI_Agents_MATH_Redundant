    "Content": "I have seen the bounds $\\left(\\frac{n}{k}\\right)^k \\leq {n \\choose k} \\leq \\left( \\frac{en}{k}\\right)^k$ for integers $n \\geq k >0$ for the binomial coefficient. I can prove the upper bound in this inequality, but I'm missing some detail for the lower bound. Does anyone know some simple way to prove this lower bound? For completion let me put the proof for the upper bound. We know that $${n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!} = \\frac{n \\cdot (n-1) \\dots (n-(k-1))}{k!} \\leq \\frac{n^k}{k!} - (1)$$ Now let us look at the expansion of $$e^k=\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{k^i}{i!}$$ Now if we just pick the term wrt $k$ , we get $e^k > \\frac{k^k}{k!}$ . Which implies $\\frac{1}{k!}< \\left(\\frac{e}{k}\\right)^k$ Now substituting in equation $(1)$ , we get the bound.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, we see that for $k=1$ we have a trivial statement\n$$\\left( \\frac{n}{k} \\right)^k = n \\leq n = \\binom{n}{k}.$$ Now, consider $k > 1$ and let $0 < m < k \\leq n$. Then $$k \\leq n \\Rightarrow \\frac{m}{n} \\leq \\frac{m}{k} \\Rightarrow 1 - \\frac{m}{k} \\leq 1- \\frac{m}{n} \\Rightarrow \\frac{k-m}{k} \\leq \\frac{n-m}{n} \\Rightarrow \\frac{n}{k} \\leq \\frac{n-m}{k-m}$$\nHence,\n$$\\left( \\frac{n}{k} \\right)^k = \\frac{n}{k} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{n}{k} \\leq \\frac{n}{k} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{k-1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{n-k+1}{1} = \\binom{n}{k}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's instructions. The original problem is about proving lower and upper bounds for binomial coefficients. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions line by line and then the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The question mentions that the bounds are for integers n ≥ k > 0. So, the assumptions here would be that n and k are integers, n is greater than or equal to k, and k is greater than 0. Each assumption should be on a separate line, addressing one property per line for one object. \n\nNext, the problem statement itself is to prove the lower bound (n/k)^k ≤ C(n,k) and the upper bound C(n,k) ≤ (en/k)^k. The user already knows how to prove the upper bound but needs help with the lower bound. However, the task is just to structure the problem, not to answer it. So the problem part should state both bounds as given, since the original question is about proving both, but the user is specifically asking about the lower bound. But according to the example, the problem part should just restate the problem as presented. The example included both the lower and upper bounds in the problem statement even though the user was asking about the lower bound. So following that, the problem here should include both bounds.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was listed, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in this case, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. The original problem states \"for integers n ≥ k >0\", so those are the conditions. So each of those should be separate assumptions: n is an integer, k is an integer, n ≥ k, and k > 0. Each of these is a separate line.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- k is an integer,\n- n is greater than or equal to k,\n- k is greater than 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that (n/k)^k ≤ C(n,k) ≤ (en/k)^k. The problem statement in the original question includes both bounds, even though the user is asking specifically about the lower bound. But the task is to structure the problem as given, not the user's specific request. Wait, but the example given by the user took the original problem and filtered out the unnecessary information. In the example, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n... divisible by 91\" but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory because in the example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that as an assumption. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem in the example was: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So maybe the user in that example made a mistake, but following the example, I need to replicate the approach. Wait, perhaps in that example, the actual problem had an unspoken assumption that n must be divisible by 7 for A(n) to be divisible by 91, but the original problem didn't state that. But the example shows that the formatted problem includes assumptions beyond what's in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but I need to follow the user's example structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was a mistake. Because in the original example, the problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error unless the original problem actually had that condition. But according to the user's example, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but the formatted problem added that as an assumption. That's confusing. Maybe the user intended that sometimes assumptions are not explicitly stated but derived from the problem. However, in the current problem, the user is to filter out unrelated information and list the assumptions. The original question here says \"for integers n ≥ k >0\", so those are the explicit conditions. Therefore, the assumptions should list those conditions.\n\nThus, the assumptions here are:\n\n- n is an integer,\n- k is an integer,\n- n is greater than or equal to k,\n- k is greater than 0.\n\nEach on a separate line. Then the problem is to prove the lower and upper bounds for the binomial coefficient as given. The user mentions they can prove the upper bound but need help with the lower bound, but according to the example, the problem part should just restate the original problem, which in this case is proving both bounds. So the problem statement would be to prove both inequalities, even though the user is asking specifically about the lower bound. However, perhaps the problem part should reflect exactly what the user is trying to solve. But in the example, the problem part was the original problem, not the user's specific request. The example's problem part was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91,\" even though the user might have had additional conditions. So following that, the problem here should be to prove both bounds, as stated in the original problem title and the initial part of the question. The user's specific request about the lower bound is part of their question, but the formatted problem should capture the original problem's statement.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as the conditions on n and k, and the problem statement as proving both bounds.",
