    "Content": "When I was in high school, I was fascinated by $\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n k= \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ so I tried to find the general solution for $\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ s.t $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . I used a similar approach to\nmy answer here My approach was turning $n^m$ to $n(n-1)(n-2)\\dots (n-m+1)+ f(n)$ and to use the fact that $$\\displaystyle\\dbinom{n}{k}+\\dbinom{n}{k+1}= \\dbinom{n+1}{k+1}$$ $f(n) $ will be combination of sums $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^n k^i$ st $i<m$ which I evaluated before I was able to to find the sum up to $m=6$ .

When I was in high school I couldn't prove this pattern, and this question reminded me of this observation that I had totally forgotten about.

Although this question has been almost solved before, I still would like to see if there is any other proofs or methods. Update: I asked this question on MO here",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first part of the question  was answered here (The answer shows that $\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ is divisible by ${n^2(n+1)^2}$ for odd $m>1$ and $\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$ is divisible by ${n(2n+1)(n+1)}$ for even $m$ ) Thanks to Sam Hopkins and Sil for recommending this paper . $S_m(n)=\\frac{P_{m+1}}{d_m}$ , where $P_{m+1}(n)$ is an $m+1$ polynomial with integer coefficients $\\{ a_{m+1},\\dots a_1,a_0 \\}$ such that $\\gcd \\{ a_{m+1},\\dots a_1,a_0 \\}=1$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to parse the original question and structure it according to the given format. The user has provided an example, so I should follow that closely. \n\nThe original problem is about a conjecture regarding the summation of k^m from k=1 to n. The user noticed a pattern where for odd m>1, the sum can be expressed as S_3(n) multiplied by a polynomial P_{m-3}(n) divided by some natural number N_m. For even m, it's S_2(n) times another polynomial P'_{m-2}(n) divided by N_m. The problem is to prove this conjecture.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example shows that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me go through the problem statement again.\n\nThe conjecture states:\n- For odd m > 1, the sum S_m(n) = S_3(n) * [P_{m-3}(n)/N_m], where P is a (m-3)-degree polynomial with integer coefficients, gcd of coefficients is 1, and N_m is a natural number.\n- For even m, the sum S_m(n) = S_2(n) * [P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m], similar conditions on P' and N_m.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that a previous answer showed divisibility by certain terms (n²(n+1)² for odd m, n(2n+1)(n+1)/6 for even m), but the missing part is showing the denominator's factors (4 for odd, 6 for even). However, the user still wants alternative proofs or methods.\n\nSo the main problem is to prove the conjecture as stated, with the specific forms involving S_3 and S_2 for odd and even m respectively, along with the polynomial fractions.\n\nNow, structuring the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. m is a natural number.\n2. For odd m > 1, the sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m.\n3. For odd m > 1, S_m(n) is expressed as S_3(n) multiplied by a polynomial P_{m-3}(n) divided by N_m.\n4. P_{m-3}(n) is a polynomial of degree m - 3.\n5. P_{m-3}(n) has integer coefficients with gcd 1.\n6. N_m is a natural number.\n7. For even m, the sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m.\n8. For even m, S_m(n) is expressed as S_2(n) multiplied by a polynomial P'_{m-2}(n) divided by N_m.\n9. P'_{m-2}(n) is a polynomial of degree m - 2.\n10. P'_{m-2}(n) has integer coefficients with gcd 1.\n11. N_m is a natural number.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these are part of the conjecture to be proven, not assumptions. The problem is to prove that the sum can be expressed in that form. So the assumptions would be the given conditions under which the problem is posed. For example, the problem isn't assuming that S_m(n) is expressible in that form; that's what needs to be proven. Therefore, the actual assumptions are the conditions given in the conjecture, which are:\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, in that example, the user had added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So perhaps the user made a mistake? Or maybe in that example, there was an error. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. So perhaps the example has an error, but the user wants us to follow the format regardless. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe in the example, there was a misunderstanding. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, but the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. However, the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to extract the assumptions from the problem as stated. Therefore, in the current problem, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem statement, not the ones that need to be proven.\n\nLooking at the current problem, the user's conjecture is about expressing the sum S_m(n) in terms of S_3(n) or S_2(n) multiplied by a certain polynomial over N_m. The problem is to prove this conjecture. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions under which the conjecture is made. Let's check the problem statement:\n\nThe user noticed the pattern and stated the conjecture. The conjecture has certain conditions: for odd m>1, even m, the form of the polynomial, etc. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- For odd m > 1, the sum S_m(n) is expressed as S_3(n) multiplied by a polynomial P_{m-3}(n)/N_m.\n- P_{m-3}(n) is a polynomial of degree m-3 with integer coefficients, gcd 1.\n- N_m is a natural number.\n- For even m, similar with S_2(n) and P'_{m-2}(n).\n\nBut wait, the conjecture is that the sum can be written in that way. So the problem is to prove that for every natural number m, when m is odd and greater than 1, the sum S_m(n) equals S_3(n) times that fraction, and similarly for even m. Therefore, the assumptions would be the given conditions under which the problem is posed. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer (which is given in the problem statement), and an extra condition (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example.\n\nBut given that the user wants us to structure the problem as per the example, even if the example might have an error, we need to proceed. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means n is any integer. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That's incorrect. The correct assumption should only be that n is an integer, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. The formatted example added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, the example is flawed. However, the user might still want us to follow their format, perhaps extracting assumptions from the problem even if they are not explicitly stated. But that seems risky.\n\nGiven that, in the current problem, the conjecture is stated as:\n\nFor odd m >1, sum k^m = S_3(n) * P_{m-3}(n)/N_m, and for even m, sum k^m = S_2(n)*P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m, with conditions on P and N.\n\nThe problem is to prove this conjecture. So the assumptions would be the hypotheses of the conjecture. But the conjecture itself is the statement to be proven. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- For odd m >1, the sum S_m(n) is considered.\n- For even m, the sum S_m(n) is considered.\n- S_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4.\n- S_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the assumptions might be the observed patterns from the examples given (S_4 to S_{11}), but those are part of the conjecture.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that m is a natural number, and m is either odd >1 or even. Then the problem is to prove the expressions as conjectured.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- m is a natural number.\n- For odd m, m > 1.\n- For even m, m ≥ 2.\n- S_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4.\n- S_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6.\n- P_{m-3}(n) is a polynomial of degree m-3 with integer coefficients.\n- The coefficients of P_{m-3}(n) are coprime.\n- N_m is a natural number.\n- Similarly for even m with P'_{m-2}(n).\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions are the ones that define the problem's conditions. The problem is to prove the conjecture, so the conjecture's conditions are the assumptions. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a natural number,\nFor odd m, m >1,\nFor even m, m is a positive integer,\nThe sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m,\nS_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4,\nS_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6,\nFor odd m >1, S_m(n) can be expressed as S_3(n) multiplied by a polynomial P_{m-3}(n)/N_m where P has integer coefficients with gcd 1 and N_m is natural,\nFor even m, S_m(n) can be expressed as S_2(n) multiplied by a polynomial P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m with similar conditions.\n\nBut wait, no. The conjecture is that S_m(n) CAN be expressed in that way. So the problem is to prove that such an expression exists under the assumptions that m is natural, odd >1 or even. Therefore, the assumptions are the given conditions (m is natural, odd >1 or even) and the problem is to prove the expression.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that, which was a mistake. However, perhaps the user wants to list all conditions that are given in the problem. The original problem here states that the conjecture is for m being a natural number, with odd m>1 and even m. So the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a natural number,\nFor odd m, m >1,\nFor even m, m is a positive integer,\nThe sum S_m(n) is defined as sum_{k=1}^n k^m,\nS_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4,\nS_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6,\nFor odd m >1, there exists a polynomial P_{m-3}(n) of degree m-3 with integer coefficients and coprime coefficients,\nFor odd m >1, there exists a natural number N_m such that S_m(n) = S_3(n) * P_{m-3}(n)/N_m,\nFor even m, there exists a polynomial P'_{m-2}(n) of degree m-2 with integer coefficients and coprime coefficients,\nFor even m, there exists a natural number N_m such that S_m(n) = S_2(n) * P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m.\n\nBut actually, the problem is to prove the existence of such polynomials and N_m. So the assumptions are the conditions on m and the definitions of S_m, S_3, S_2. The conjectured expressions are what need to be proven. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nm is a natural number,\nFor odd m, m >1,\nFor even m, m is a positive integer,\nThe sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m,\nS_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4,\nS_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6.\n\nProblem: Prove that for odd m >1, S_m(n) can be expressed as S_3(n) * [P_{m-3}(n)/N_m], where P_{m-3} is a polynomial of degree m-3 with integer coefficients, gcd 1, and N_m natural. Similarly for even m, express S_m(n) as S_2(n) * [P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m].\n\nBut to fit the example's format, which listed assumptions as separate lines, each with one property. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- m is a natural number.\n- For odd m, m > 1.\n- For even m, m ≥ 2.\n- S_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4.\n- S_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6.\n- The sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m.\n\nProblem: Prove that for odd m >1, there exists a polynomial P_{m-3}(n) of degree m-3 with integer coefficients whose coefficients are coprime, and a natural number N_m such that S_m(n) = S_3(n) × (P_{m-3}(n)/N_m); and for even m, there exists a polynomial P'_{m-2}(n) of degree m-2 with integer coefficients whose coefficients are coprime, and a natural number N_m such that S_m(n) = S_2(n) × (P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m).\n\nBut the original problem's conjecture also mentions that the denominator N_m is such that for odd m, the denominator is a multiple of 4, and for even m, a multiple of 6. However, the user mentions that this part is missing and is part of the question. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"the only missing part is to show that the denominator is a multiple of 4 if m is odd, and the denominator is a multiple of 6 if m is even. Although this question has been almost solved before, I still would like to see if there is any other proofs or methods.\"\n\nBut the main conjecture is about the form of the sum as S_3 or S_2 multiplied by the polynomial over N_m. The missing part is about the divisibility of the denominator. However, the problem as stated in the user's question is to prove the entire conjecture, including the structure with the polynomials and N_m. The user mentions that part of it has been answered, but they want alternative proofs.\n\nGiven that, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include the definitions of S_3, S_2, and the conditions on m. The problem is to prove the expression as conjectured.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nm is a natural number,\nFor odd m, m > 1,\nFor even m, m is a positive integer,\n$S_3(n) = \\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$,\n$S_2(n) = \\frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6}$,\n$S_m(n) = \\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n k^m$.\nProblem:\nProve that for odd m > 1, there exists a polynomial $P_{m-3}(n)$ of degree $m-3$ with integer coefficients and coprime coefficients, and a natural number $N_m$ such that $S_m(n) = S_3(n) \\times \\frac{P_{m-3}(n)}{N_m}$; and for even m, there exists a polynomial $P'_{m-2}(n)$ of degree $m-2$ with integer coefficients and coprime coefficients, and a natural number $N_m$ such that $S_m(n) = S_2(n) \\times \\frac{P'_{m-2}(n)}{N_m}$.\n### \n\nBut wait, the original conjecture also mentions that for odd m, N_m is such that the denominator is a multiple of 4, and for even m, a multiple of 6. But the user says that part is missing and wants to see proofs for that. However, the way the problem is stated, the conjecture includes the form with N_m. The user's question is to prove that the sum can be expressed in that form, including the denominator's divisibility. The problem mentions that this has been partly answered, but the missing part is about the denominator's factors. Therefore, perhaps the problem should include proving both the expression and the divisibility conditions on N_m.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user writes:\n\n\"the only missing part is to show that the denominator is a multiple of 4 if m∈2N+1, and the denominator is a multiple of 6 if m∈2N. Although this question has been almost solved before, I still would like to see if there is any other proofs or methods.\"\n\nSo the main problem now is to prove the denominator conditions. However, the user still wants the entire conjecture proved. The formatted problem should probably encapsulate the entire conjecture as the problem to prove, including the denominator's divisibility. Therefore, adjusting the problem statement to include that N_m is a multiple of 4 for odd m and 6 for even m.\n\nBut the original conjecture as stated by the user says:\n\n\"For odd m>1, ∑k=1^n k^m= S_3(n) × P_{m−3}(n)/N_m s.t P_{m−3}(n) is an m−3 polynomial with integer coefficients {a_{m−3},…a_1,a_0} such that gcd{a_{m−3},…a_1,a_0}=1, N_m∈N. For even m, ∑k=1^n k^m= S_2(n) × P'_{m−2}(n)/N_m s.t P'_{m−2}(n) is an m−2 polynomial with integer coefficients {a_{m−2},…a_1,a_0} such that gcd{a_{m−2},…a_1,a_0}=1, N_m∈N.\"\n\nSo the problem is to prove that such an expression exists with those conditions. Additionally, the user mentions that the denominator (N_m) should be a multiple of 4 for odd m and 6 for even m, which was the missing part in previous answers. But the conjecture itself includes that N_m is a natural number, not necessarily that it's a multiple of 4 or 6. However, the user's update says that the question has been partly answered, showing divisibility by S_3(n) and S_2(n)'s denominators, and the missing part is the denominator's factors. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to prove the conjecture's form AND that N_m must be a multiple of 4 (for odd m) or 6 (even m).\n\nBut in the formatted problem, how to incorporate that? The problem statement would need to include proving the expression and the divisibility of N_m.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's main conjecture is about the form, and the denominator's divisibility is part of that, but the previous answer showed that the sum is divisible by S_3(n) or S_2(n), so the remaining part is that when you write the sum as S_3(n) × (polynomial/N_m), then N_m must be a multiple of 4 (for odd m) and similarly 6 for even m.\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is to prove the conjecture. Therefore, in the formatted problem, we need to list the assumptions and then the problem to prove.\n\nPutting it all together, the assumptions would be:\n\n- m is a natural number.\n- For odd m, m >1.\n- For even m, m is a positive integer.\n- S_3(n) = n²(n+1)²/4.\n- S_2(n) = n(2n+1)(n+1)/6.\n- The sum S_m(n) = sum_{k=1}^n k^m.\n\nProblem: Prove that for odd m >1, S_m(n) can be expressed as S_3(n) multiplied by a polynomial P_{m-3}(n)/N_m, where P_{m-3}(n) is a degree m-3 polynomial with integer coefficients having gcd 1, and N_m is a natural number multiple of 4; and for even m, S_m(n) can be expressed as S_2(n) multiplied by P'_{m-2}(n)/N_m, where P'_{m-2}(n) is a degree m-2 polynomial with integer coefficients having gcd 1, and N_m is a natural number multiple of 6.\n\nBut the original conjecture didn't explicitly state that N_m is a multiple of 4 or 6; that was the missing part. The user mentions that the previous answer showed divisibility by S_3(n) or S_2(n), implying that when written as S_3(n) × something, the something must have a denominator that divides N_m. Wait, perhaps it's the other way around: the sum is divisible by S_3(n) or S_2(n), so when you write the sum as S_3(n) × (something), then that something must be an integer polynomial divided by N_m, and N_m must account for the denominator needed to make the fraction integral. But this is getting complicated.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to follow the user's example and structure the assumptions and problem based on the conjecture as stated, including the conditions on the polynomials and N_m being natural numbers, and the problem is to prove the existence of such expressions. The divisibility part about 4 and 6 might be part of the problem but was the missing piece in previous answers. However, the user wants alternative proofs.\n\nGiven the length and complexity, I think the formatted problem should capture the main conjecture as stated, listing the assumptions about m being natural, odd or even, and the forms involving S_3 and S_2. The problem is to prove that the sum can be expressed in those forms with the given conditions on the polynomials and N_m. The specific divisibility of N_m by 4 or 6 is part of the problem but might be considered part of proving that N_m is a natural number (i.e., that the denominator divides the numerator when multiplied by S_3 or S_2).\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, here's the formatted problem:",
