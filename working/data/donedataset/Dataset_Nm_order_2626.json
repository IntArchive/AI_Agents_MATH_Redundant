    "Content": "A function $f$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$ is defined by: for each $\\varepsilon>0$, there is a $\\delta>0$, for each finite disjoint open interval $\\{(c_k,d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ contained in $[a,b]$, we have\n$$\n\\text{if}\\,\\, \\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k-c_k)<\\delta, \\,\\,\\text{then}\\,\\, \\sum_{k=1}^n\\left|f(d_k)-f(c_k)\\right|<\\varepsilon.\n$$ However, in the book I'm reading, it is said that there is a equivalent definition, say\n$$\n\\text{if}\\,\\, \\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k-c_k)<\\delta,\\,\\, \\text{then}\\,\\, \\left|\\sum_{k=1}^n f(d_k)-f(c_k)\\right|<\\varepsilon.\n$$ However, I can not prove it.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question about equivalent definitions of absolute continuity. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe user mentions that the standard definition of absolute continuity requires that for any ε > 0, there's a δ > 0 such that for any finite collection of disjoint intervals in [a,b], if the total length is less than δ, then the sum of the absolute differences of f over those intervals is less than ε. Then, they present an alternative definition where instead of the sum of absolute differences, it's the absolute value of the sum of differences. The user is confused about proving the equivalence between these two definitions.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided by the user shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition or property applied to one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key elements are:\n\n1. The function f is absolutely continuous on [a,b] as per the standard definition.\n2. There's a proposed equivalent definition where the sum of absolute differences is replaced by the absolute value of the sum.\n3. The user cannot prove the equivalence between these two definitions.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user is asking about proving that the alternative definition is equivalent. So the problem is to show that the two definitions are equivalent. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in each definition. However, the user's question is about proving the equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions need to capture both definitions as separate conditions?\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, but in the formatted version, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, the user didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that example had a mistake? Wait, no, looking at the example again: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" Then, the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, in the original problem, the user says \"for every integer n\", so why in the formatted problem is there an assumption that n is divisible by 7? That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a mistake in the example? Hmm. Because the original problem didn't state any restriction on n except being an integer. Wait, but 91 is 7*13. So maybe the example was trying to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, but perhaps the original problem was different. Maybe the example was a bad example, but I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user is asking how to prove that the two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent. So the problem is to show that the standard definition (with the sum of absolute differences) is equivalent to the alternative definition (with the absolute of the sum of differences). \n\nTo structure this correctly, the assumptions should list the conditions given in each definition. However, since the problem is to prove equivalence between two definitions, maybe the assumptions are the properties each definition requires, but I need to parse the problem as per the user's format.\n\nWait, looking at the example, in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the example was modified to include n divisible by 7 to make A(n) divisible by 91? Because if n is an arbitrary integer, maybe A(n) is divisible by 91 only when n is divisible by 6 or something else. But perhaps the example was not correctly structured. Anyway, maybe I should focus on the current problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user presents two definitions of absolute continuity. The standard one with the sum of absolute values, and another one with the absolute value of the sum. The task is to prove their equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that these two definitions are equivalent. So the assumptions would be the properties of absolute continuity as per each definition. But wait, the user is asking to prove equivalence, so perhaps the assumptions are the two definitions? Or maybe only the original definition is given as an assumption, and the problem is to show the equivalence.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem lists assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct if the original problem was slightly different, but in any case, for the current problem, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nThe user's instruction says: \"Assumption: <All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object>\"\n\nSo in the current problem, the original definition is given as the standard definition, and the alternative definition is presented as equivalent. The user is asking to prove the equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in each definition, but since the problem is to show equivalence, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n1. $f$ is a function defined on interval $[a,b]$.\n2. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for every finite collection of disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n3. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for every finite collection of disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that these two definitions are equivalent. However, the user's original question says that in the book, it's said that there is an equivalent definition, and the user can't prove it. So the problem is to show that the standard definition (with sum of absolute values) implies the alternative one (absolute of sum) and vice versa.\n\nHowever, in reality, the standard definition of absolute continuity is the first one with the sum of absolute values. The second definition, with the absolute of the sum, is actually equivalent, but the user is struggling to see why.\n\nTherefore, structuring this problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in each definition, but since the problem is to show equivalence between the two, perhaps the assumptions should list the properties of the function f as per each definition.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the problem structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: The function f is defined on [a,b].\nProblem: Prove that the two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are more specific. In the example, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem didn't state n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nGiven the original question, the user is presenting two definitions and wants to prove their equivalence. So the problem is to prove the equivalence between the two definitions. The assumptions would be the properties given in each definition. However, since we need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the above two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent.\n\nBut this seems redundant because the problem is to show equivalence, but listing both definitions as assumptions would make the problem trivial. So maybe the correct way is to take one as the assumption and the other as the problem. For instance, if the standard definition is the assumption, then the problem is to show that it implies the alternative definition, and vice versa. But the user's example shows that in the formatted problem, the assumption might be the conditions given, and the problem is the conclusion to prove.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but maybe the user intended to modify the problem, perhaps focusing on a specific case. However, that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's formatted problem is incorrect. In any case, perhaps the user's intention is to extract the key assumptions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is discussing two definitions. The standard definition involves the sum of absolute differences, and the alternative uses the absolute of the sum. The question is to prove their equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions would be the conditions of each definition, but since the problem is to show equivalence, perhaps the assumptions should list the properties needed for each direction.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So for example, for the first direction (standard implies alternative), we can assume the standard definition and then the problem is to prove the alternative. For the reverse, assume the alternative and prove the standard. But the user's question is about proving the equivalence, so maybe the problem is to show both directions.\n\nBut the user's example seems to have the assumptions as the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Which suggests that the answer was perhaps for a different problem, but maybe the user made a mistake. However, I need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe user's problem is to prove that the two definitions are equivalent. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite collection of disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this condition is equivalent to the existence, for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, of a $\\delta > 0$ such that for any such collection, if the total length is less than $\\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$ implies $\\sum |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this implies for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$ implies $|\\sum (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$, and vice versa.\n\nBut maybe the user wants each direction as separate problems. However, according to the example, the problem is stated in one line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this is equivalent to the condition that for each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each being a single property. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7.\" So each line is a separate condition. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the two conditions above are equivalent.\n\nHowever, this seems redundant because the problem is to show equivalence, but listing both conditions as assumptions would make the problem statement trivial. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to have the assumption be the standard definition and the problem to prove the alternative, and vice versa. But the user wants the problem structured with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are just the basic setting, like the function being on [a,b], and the problem is to show equivalence between the two definitions.\n\nBut given the user's example, where the original problem's assumption wasn't explicitly stated but was inferred, maybe the correct structure here is:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this condition is equivalent to: For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for each finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So maybe the user's example is not the best guide. However, following the user's instruction strictly, the assumptions should list all the conditions given in the problem. Since the problem presents two definitions, but the user is asking to prove their equivalence, the assumptions should include both definitions' conditions, but that would make the problem redundant. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to list the basic assumption (f is a function on [a,b]) and the problem is to prove the equivalence between the two definitions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions include specific conditions. Maybe the assumptions here are:\n\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- In the standard definition of absolute continuity, for each ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for any finite disjoint intervals with total length < δ, the sum of |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < ε.\n- In the alternative definition, for each ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for any finite disjoint intervals with total length < δ, |sum of (f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < ε.\n\nBut again, this seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem is to show equivalence, the assumptions are just that f is a function on [a,b], and the problem is to show that the two definitions are equivalent.\n\nBut the user's example included specific conditions. Perhaps I need to follow that structure. Let me look at the example again:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut this seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user's example is not reliable, and I need to proceed based on the instructions.\n\nThe user says: \"Your task is to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nSo the task is to filter unrelated info and structure the problem. In the current problem, the user's question is about proving the equivalence between two definitions of absolute continuity. The original question states the two definitions and asks how to prove their equivalence.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem, and the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, since the problem is about equivalence between two definitions, perhaps the assumptions are the properties of each definition, and the problem is to show they imply each other.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to present the problem as:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the following two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent:\n\n1. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\n2. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem is stated in one line after the assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions are the basic conditions (function on [a,b]), and the problem is to prove the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about equivalence, maybe the assumptions are the first definition, and the problem is to prove the second definition, and vice versa. But the user wants a single problem structure.\n\nGiven the user's example, which seems to include assumptions that are not explicitly in the original problem, perhaps the way to proceed is to list the key assumptions from the problem. In this case, the key elements are:\n\n- The function f is defined on [a,b].\n- The standard definition of absolute continuity (sum of absolute values).\n- The alternative definition (absolute of sum).\n\nBut since the problem is to show equivalence, the assumptions should capture the necessary conditions. However, in the example, the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is incorrectly formatted. Therefore, perhaps the user's actual instruction is to list the assumptions as the given conditions in the problem, and the problem as the thing to prove.\n\nIn the current problem, the user presents two definitions and wants to prove their equivalence. The original problem does not state any additional conditions beyond the definitions themselves and the function being on [a,b]. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- The standard definition of absolute continuity holds.\n- The alternative definition is proposed.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user's example structure includes assumptions and then the problem. Given the confusion from the example, perhaps the best way is to list the assumptions as the basic conditions (function on [a,b]) and the problem to prove equivalence between the two definitions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the following two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent:\n\n1. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\n2. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem statement is concise. In the example, the problem was restated as \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is to \"Prove that the two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent.\"\n\nHowever, to fit into the user's format, the problem should be stated after the assumptions. Given that, the assumptions would be the basic setup, and the problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut considering the user's example, which incorrectly added an assumption not in the original problem, perhaps the correct approach is to list the key assumptions from the problem. In this case, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The function f is defined on [a,b].\n- The standard definition (sum of absolute values) is given.\n- The alternative definition (absolute of sum) is proposed as equivalent.\n\nBut since the problem is to prove equivalence, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions of one definition, and the problem is to show it implies the other.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each bullet point should be a single assumption.\n\nGiven the original problem statement:\n\n\"A function $f$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$ is defined by: for each $\\varepsilon>0$, there is a $\\delta>0$, for each finite disjoint open interval $\\{(c_k,d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ contained in $[a,b]$, we have if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum |f(d_k)-f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$. However, in the book I'm reading, it is said that there is a equivalent definition, say if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum f(d_k)-f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$. However, I can not prove it. How?\"\n\nSo the original assumptions are:\n\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals in $[a,b]$ with total length < δ, the sum of absolute differences is < ε.\n- The book claims that the condition where the absolute value of the sum of differences < ε is equivalent.\n\nThe problem is to prove this equivalence.\n\nTherefore, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this condition is equivalent to: For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut in this case, the assumption includes one of the definitions, and the problem is to show equivalence to the other definition. But the user's example included two assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and the problem to prove divisibility by 91. So perhaps the equivalent here is that the assumption includes the standard definition, and the problem is to prove the alternative definition.\n\nHowever, since the problem is to show equivalence, both directions need to be proved. But the user's format might require splitting into two separate problems. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example, which in the case of the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the current case, the problem is to prove equivalence between two definitions. Therefore, the formatted problem should include the assumptions (the basic conditions and one of the definitions) and the problem to prove the other definition. However, since the equivalence requires both directions, maybe it's two separate problems. But the user's example didn't do that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the problem structured with the two definitions as assumptions and the problem to prove equivalence, but that seems off.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the correct format here is:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$ implies $\\sum |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this implies that for each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any such intervals, $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$ implies $|\\sum (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$, and vice versa.\n\nBut the user's example only had one direction. However, the problem in the example was to prove divisibility by 91, given n is an integer divisible by 7. But the original problem was for all integers. So the example might have been incorrect.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed to structure the problem as follows, following the user's instruction to list assumptions line by line and then the problem.\n\nThe original problem states two definitions and asks to prove equivalence. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals in $[a,b]$, if the total length is less than δ, then the sum of absolute differences is less than ε.\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals in $[a,b]$, if the total length is less than δ, then the absolute value of the sum of differences is less than ε.\n\nProblem: Prove that these two conditions are equivalent.\n\nHowever, listing both conditions as assumptions makes the problem trivial. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to state the basic assumption (f is on [a,b]) and then the problem to prove equivalence between the two definitions.\n\nBut according to the user's example, which listed assumptions that were not all present in the original problem, perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the following two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent:\n\n1. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\n2. For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut this includes both definitions in the problem statement. However, the user's example had the problem statement as a single line. Therefore, perhaps the problem should be phrased as:\n\nProblem: Prove that the two definitions of absolute continuity are equivalent, where:\n\n1. (Standard definition) For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\n2. (Alternative definition) For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any such intervals, if $\\sum (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut according to the user's format, the problem should be concise. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals in $[a,b]$ with total length < δ, the sum of absolute differences < ε.\n\nProblem: Prove that this is equivalent to the condition that for any such intervals, the absolute value of the sum of differences < ε when the total length < δ.\n\nBut to make it fit into the format, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f$ is a function on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: Prove that this implies and is implied by the condition that for each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any such intervals, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nThis captures the equivalence by stating that each condition implies the other. However, the problem statement becomes a bit long. Given the user's example, which had the problem statement as a single line, perhaps the best approach is to list the assumptions as the basic conditions and the problem to prove equivalence.\n\nBut given the confusion from the example, I think the correct formatted problem is:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n- $f$ is a function defined on $[a,b]$.\n- For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any finite disjoint open intervals $\\{(c_k, d_k)\\}_{k=1}^n$ in $[a,b]$, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\sum_{k=1}^n |f(d_k) - f(c_k)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nProblem: \nProve that this condition is equivalent to: For each $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any such intervals, if $\\sum_{k=1}^n (d_k - c_k) < \\delta$, then $\\left|\\sum_{k=1}^n (f(d_k) - f(c_k))\\right| < \\varepsilon$.",
