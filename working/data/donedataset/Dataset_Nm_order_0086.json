    "Content": "I had the idea to make a script that generates a pattern like this: 1\n2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9 10 ... and so on. After that, I replaced every non-prime by a '-' character and every prime number by a '|'. The output begins like that: - \n|| \n-|- \n|--- \n|-|-- \n-|-|-- \n-|----- \n|-|----- \n|---|-|-- \n-|-----|-- \n---|-|----- \n|---|-|----- \n|---|-----|-- \n-----|---|-|-- \n-|-|---|------- \n------|---|----- ... What I realized is that, with the exception of the second and third lines (possibly because of 2), on every line until 12000, the two last numbers are never prime. Obviously, one of them is even, but the odd one isn't a prime number in any of these lines. Is there a way to prove that this is true for any line? Is there any theorem that could help?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Great credit to you for having discovered this, because it is a known phenomenon presented in an unknown gem. The last element on each of the lines is the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers (for example, $1=1$ , $3=1+2$ , $6=1+2+3$ , $10=1+2+3+4$ etc.). As it turns out,the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers has a formula, given by $\\frac{n(n+1)}2$ . Therefore, the last number on every line is either divisible by the line number $n$ or its successor, $n+1$ , whichever one is odd (one of them is odd). For example, $6$ is divisible by its line number $3$ . $10$ is divisible by one more than its line number, $5$ . Which is why, unless you are on the second line, the last number is never going to be prime. In fact, the formula even gives its divisors. Similarly, the second last number on each line is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{n^2+n-2}{2} = \\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}$ , hence the factors of the second last number is the odd number out of $n + 2$ and $n - 1$ , where $n$ is the row number. We can check this also: $9$ is divisible by $3$ , one less than $4$ . $14$ is divisible by $7$ , $2$ more  than $5$ . Hence, again the second to last number is not going to be prime. I think I should add this: After some time, the fourth from last number is never going to be prime! (Think about this yourself). After some time, the seventh from last number is never going to be prime! (Think about this yourself). After some time, the eleventh from last number is never going to be prime! (Think about this yourself). It is worth wondering about the nature of those elements which are not covered under the $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - (r-1)$ scheme below. The point is, for those numbers , we take the $r-1$ on top as usual to form the number $\\frac{n(n+1) - 2r + 2}{2}$ , which we know is a natural number. The question is : is this composite or not? What we do know is that for $r = 1,2,4,7$ etc. we get factorizations of the expression $n(n+1) - 2r+2$ into two linear terms in $n$ , therefore we get composite numbers. What is true, in the case of the other $r$ s, is that we definitely will get infinitely many composite numbers while going through $n(n+1) - 2r + 2$ . This is because every non-constant polynomial takes infinitely many composite values. In our case, for example, taking $n = k(2r-2) + 1$ for $k \\in \\mathbb N$ , we see that $n(n+1) - 2r+2 = (2r-2)((k(2r-2) + 1)k - 1)$ is composite for $r \\geq 3$ . Therefore, for every $r$ , there exist infinitely many rows such that the $r$ th last number of that row is composite . As for primality, the question is still open as to whether quadratic expressions(in one variable) which are not linearly factorable take infinitely many prime values. Therefore this question will remain open for some time, whether the $r$ th last number of each row will stop containing primes after some time or will have infinitely many primes.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is talking about a sequence arranged in a triangular pattern where each row has one more number than the previous. So the first row has 1, the second has 2 and 3, the third has 4, 5, 6, and so on. Then they replace non-primes with '-' and primes with '|'. They noticed that except for the second and third lines, the last two numbers in each line up to 12000 aren't prime. They want to know if this is always true and how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. Let's list the assumptions. The key points are:\n\n1. The sequence is arranged in a triangular format where each row k has k numbers.\n2. The numbers are filled row by row, starting from 1. So row 1 is [1], row 2 is [2,3], row 3 is [4,5,6], etc.\n3. The user is focusing on the last two numbers of each row (excluding the first few rows).\n4. The observation is that for rows beyond the second and third, the last two numbers are never prime. Even though one is even, the other (odd) is also not prime.\n\nWait, the problem states that \"the two last numbers of this sequence never prime\". So the user is saying that in each row (except maybe the second and third), the last two numbers are not prime. The user is asking for a proof that this holds for any row beyond a certain point.\n\nSo the assumptions here would be:\n\n- Each row k contains k consecutive integers.\n- The first number of row k is the next integer after the last number of row (k-1).\n- For each row k ≥ 4, the last two numbers in the row are considered.\n- The problem is to prove that for any row k ≥ 4, at least one of the last two numbers is not prime (since they mention \"never prime\", but actually, one is even, so that one is non-prime except for 2. However, the user says even the odd one isn't prime. Wait, in the last two numbers of each row, one is even, so that's non-prime (unless it's 2), and the other is odd. But the user claims that even the odd one isn't prime. So their observation is that in the last two numbers of each row beyond the second and third, both are composite. But the first one (the even one) is even, so except for 2, it's non-prime. However, the other one (the last number in the row) is odd, but they say it's not prime either.\n\nWait, let's check the initial rows. Row 2: [2,3]. Both primes. Row 3: [4,5,6]. The last two are 5 and 6. 5 is prime, 6 is not. So here, one of them is prime. But the user says except for the second and third lines, the two last numbers are never prime. Wait, their example shows that row 2 and 3 might have primes, but starting from row 4 onwards, both last two numbers are non-prime. Wait, let's look at row 4: 7,8,9,10. Last two numbers 9 and 10. Both non-prime. Row 5: 11,12,13,14,15. Last two: 14 and 15. Both non-prime. Row 6: 16,17,18,19,20,21. Last two: 20,21. Non-prime. Row 7: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28. Last two:27,28. Non-prime. So yes, starting from row 4 onwards, the last two numbers are both composite. So the problem is to prove that for each row k ≥ 4, the last two numbers are both composite.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the structure.\n\nEach row k starts with the number (k(k-1)/2 +1). Wait, no. Let's check the triangular numbers. The last number of row k is the k-th triangular number, T_k = k(k+1)/2. So the last number of row k is T_k. Then the first number of row k is T_{k-1} +1. So the numbers in row k are T_{k-1}+1, T_{k-1}+2, ..., T_k.\n\nTherefore, the last two numbers of row k are T_k -1 and T_k. So T_k = k(k+1)/2. Therefore, the last two numbers are (k(k+1)/2 -1) and (k(k+1)/2).\n\nSo we need to analyze these two numbers: N1 = (k(k+1)/2) -1 and N2 = k(k+1)/2.\n\nFirst, N2 is always a triangular number, which is equal to k(k+1)/2. Since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so N2 is an integer. Now, N2 is equal to T_k, the k-th triangular number. Except for k=1,2,3, T_k is a composite number? Wait, for k=1, T1=1 (not prime). k=2: 3 (prime). k=3:6 (composite). k=4:10 (composite). k=5:15 (composite). So starting from k=2, T2=3 (prime), T3=6 (composite). But the user says except the second and third lines. Wait, in row 2, last two numbers are 2 and 3, both primes. In row 3, last two numbers are 5 and 6. 5 is prime, 6 is not. But the user says except for the second and third lines, the two last numbers are never prime. So in rows k ≥4, both N1 and N2 are composite. Let's check row 4: N1 = 10-1=9 (composite), N2=10 (composite). Row 5: N1=15-1=14 (composite), N2=15 (composite). Row 6:21-1=20 (composite),21 (composite). So indeed, from row 4 onwards, both last numbers are composite.\n\nSo the problem reduces to proving that for k ≥4, both N1 = T_k -1 and N2 = T_k are composite. But N2 = T_k = k(k+1)/2. For k ≥4, is T_k always composite? Let's see: k=4:10 (composite). k=5:15 (composite). k=6:21 (composite). k=7:28 (composite). Yes. So T_k is composite for k ≥3 except when k=2:3 (prime). So N2 is composite for k ≥3 except k=2. Therefore, for rows k ≥4, N2 is composite. So that takes care of the second number. Now for N1 = T_k -1. For k ≥4, we need to show that N1 is composite.\n\nSo the problem is to show that for each k ≥4, both T_k and T_k -1 are composite. We already know that T_k is composite for k ≥3 except k=2. So the main part is to prove that T_k -1 is composite for k ≥4.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The sequence is arranged in rows where row k contains k consecutive integers starting from T_{k-1} +1 to T_k, where T_k is the k-th triangular number.\n- For each row k ≥4, consider the last two numbers: T_k -1 and T_k.\n- T_k is composite for k ≥3 (except k=2).\n- The problem is to prove that T_k -1 is also composite for k ≥4.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more specific. Let's re-express the user's problem.\n\nThe user's Problem: Why are the last two numbers of each row (except the second and third) never prime? Need to prove that for any row k ≥4, both last two numbers are composite.\n\nSo the assumptions as per the required format should list all conditions applied to the objects.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The sequence is arranged in a triangular format where row k contains k consecutive integers.\n- The first number of row k is the next integer after the last number of row k-1.\n- The problem considers the last two numbers of each row.\n- For rows k ≥4, the last two numbers are considered.\n- The last number of row k is the k-th triangular number, T_k = k(k+1)/2.\n- The second last number of row k is T_k -1.\n\nProblem: Prove that for any row k ≥4, both T_k -1 and T_k are composite numbers.\n\nNow, in the example given by the user, the formatted problem lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is arranged in rows where each row k contains k consecutive integers,\nThe first integer of row k is the next after the last integer of row k-1,\nFor each row k ≥4, we consider the last two numbers,\nThe last number in row k is the triangular number T_k = k(k+1)/2,\nThe second last number in row k is T_k -1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any row k ≥4, both T_k -1 and T_k are composite numbers.\n\nAlternatively, to fit the example's style, perhaps each assumption is a single line, each applying to one object. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sequence is structured such that row k contains k consecutive integers,\nRow k starts immediately after row k−1 ends,\nFor each row k ≥4, the last two numbers are considered,\nThe last number in row k is T_k = k(k+1)/2,\nThe second last number in row k is T_k − 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that for any row k ≥4, both T_k −1 and T_k are composite numbers.\n\nYes, this seems correct. Each assumption is a single line, each addressing a specific property. Then the problem statement.",
