    "Content": "Working on the following problem from Munkres: Let $(X, d_{X})$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ be metric spaces; let $Y$ be complete.\n  Let $A \\subset X$. Show that if $f:A \\to Y$ is uniformly continuous,\n  then $f$ can be uniquely extended t a continuous function $g:\n \\overline{A} \\to Y$, and $g$ is uniformly continuous. If there exists such an extension, it must be unique, and $f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}f(x_n)$ for $x_n$ a sequence in $A$ converging to $x \\in \\overline{A}$. To show this limit exists, let $x_n \\to x$, then $f(x_n)$ is Cauchy, since uniformly continuous functions take Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences. Then $f(x_n)$ converges by completeness, and I claim it converges to $f(x)$. Now, to show $g$ is uniformly continuous, I kind of brute-forced it, and I was wondering if anyone had a more elegant method. (I consider the proof up to now pretty elegant.) What I did was: Suppose for contradiction that $\\exists \\epsilon >0$ s.t. $\\forall \\delta >0\\,\\, \\exists x_\\delta, y_\\delta \\in \\overline{A}$ s.t. $d(x_\\delta, y_\\delta)< \\delta$ and $d(g(x_\\delta), g(y_\\delta))> \\epsilon$. Let $\\delta := \\delta_{\\epsilon}/2$, where $\\delta_\\epsilon$ is taken from the uniform continuity of $f$. Now $d(g(\\cdot), g(\\cdot))$ is continuous...in particular, it is continuous in each variable separately. Therefore we can vary $x_{\\delta}$ and $y_{\\delta}$ a little bit, to get $x^*,\\, y^* \\in A$ such that $d(x^*, y^*)<\\delta_{\\epsilon}$ and $d(f(x^*), f(y^*))>\\epsilon$, a contradiction. Does anyone know a more elegant method to show the uniform continuity?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "(Your proof above should explicitly show that $g$ is independent of the sequence used to define it. This is the key point of the proof.) Let $\\epsilon>0$, then you have some $\\delta>0$ such that if $d(x,y) < \\delta$, then $d(f(x),f(y)) < {1 \\over 2}\\epsilon$. Pick $x,y \\in \\overline{A}$ such that $d(x,y) < \\delta$, and let $x_n,y_n$ be sequences in $A$ such that\n$x_n \\to x,y_n \\to y$. By construction above, $g(x) = \\lim_n f(x_n)$ and similarly for $g(y)$. For sufficiently large $n$, we have $d(x_n,y_n) < \\delta$, and so $d(f(x_n),f(y_n)) < {1 \\over 2}\\epsilon$. Taking limits we have $d(g(x),g(y)) \\le {1 \\over 2}\\epsilon < \\epsilon$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to format the given problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about extending a uniformly continuous function to the closure of its domain. \n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem states: \n- (X, d_X) and (Y, d_Y) are metric spaces.\n- Y is complete.\n- A is a subset of X.\n- f: A → Y is uniformly continuous.\n- The task is to show that f has a unique extension to the closure of A, denoted as g: closure(A) → Y, which is also uniformly continuous.\n\nSo breaking this down into individual assumptions:\n1. (X, d_X) is a metric space.\n2. (Y, d_Y) is a metric space.\n3. Y is complete.\n4. A is a subset of X.\n5. f: A → Y is uniformly continuous.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition on different objects (X, Y, A, f). The problem then is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the extension g with the stated properties.\n\nThe user's example included assumptions that were more specific, like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the assumptions are more about the structures involved. I need to ensure each assumption is a single line, addressing one property of one object. Let me check again:\n\n- The first two points are about X and Y being metric spaces. Each is a separate assumption.\n- Y's completeness is another assumption.\n- A being a subset of X is another.\n- f's uniform continuity is the last one.\n\nThat seems to cover all the given conditions. Now, the problem statement is to show the existence of a unique uniformly continuous extension to the closure of A. The user's example for the problem part was concise, so I should mirror that.\n\nProblem: Prove that f can be uniquely extended to a continuous function g: \\overline{A} → Y, and g is uniformly continuous.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user already outlined part of the proof, asking for a more elegant method to show uniform continuity. However, the task here is just to structure the problem as per the given format, not to answer the question. So the problem part should encapsulate the original question's main task, which is to show the existence and uniqueness of the extension with uniform continuity.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as above and state the problem as proving the existence of the unique uniformly continuous extension.",
