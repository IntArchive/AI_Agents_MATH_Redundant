    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's take a look at this problem. The user wants to prove that the arctangent of this complicated expression involving square roots equals π/4 plus half the arccosine of x squared. They tried manipulating the equation using trigonometric identities but ended up with a result that's the negative of what's given. So, where's the mistake?\n\nFirst, let me parse the original problem. The expression given is:\n\ntan⁻¹[(√(1+x²) + √(1−x²)) / (√(1+x²) − √(1−x²)))] = π/4 + (1/2)cos⁻¹(x²)\n\nThe user set this equal to φ and started working through the equations. Let's follow their steps step by step.\n\nThey wrote: (tan φ + 1)/(tan φ - 1) = sqrt[(1 + x²)/(1 - x²)]\n\nHmm, how did they get here? Let me think. If we let φ be the arctangent expression, then tan φ is the argument of the arctangent. So:\n\ntan φ = [√(1+x²) + √(1−x²)] / [√(1+x²) − √(1−x²)]\n\nThen they manipulated this equation. Let me verify the first step. They cross-multiplied to get (tan φ + 1)/(tan φ - 1) equals the square root part. Wait, perhaps they rationalized the denominator or numerator. Let me compute tan φ.\n\nLet me denote N = √(1+x²) + √(1−x²) and D = √(1+x²) − √(1−x²), so tan φ = N/D.\n\nThey then considered (tan φ + 1)/(tan φ - 1). Substitute N/D:\n\n(N/D + 1)/(N/D - 1) = [(N + D)/D] / [(N - D)/D] = (N + D)/(N - D)\n\nBut N + D = [√(1+x²) + √(1−x²)] + [√(1+x²) − √(1−x²)] = 2√(1+x²)\n\nSimilarly, N - D = 2√(1−x²)\n\nTherefore, (N + D)/(N - D) = (2√(1+x²))/(2√(1−x²)) = sqrt[(1+x²)/(1−x²)]\n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, their first step is valid: (tan φ +1)/(tan φ -1) = sqrt[(1+x²)/(1−x²)]\n\nNext step: They squared both sides to eliminate the square root. So:\n\n[(1 + tan²φ + 2 tan φ)/(1 + tan²φ - 2 tan φ)] = (1 + x²)/(1 - x²)\n\nWait, squaring the left side: [(tan φ +1)/(tan φ -1)]² = [ (tan φ +1)^2 ] / [ (tan φ -1)^2 ]\n\nExpanding numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: tan²φ + 2 tan φ + 1\n\nDenominator: tan²φ - 2 tan φ + 1\n\nSo indeed, the left side is [ (1 + tan²φ + 2 tan φ ) / (1 + tan²φ - 2 tan φ ) ]\n\nWhich they set equal to (1 + x²)/(1 - x²). That's correct.\n\nThen they said, \"Taking reciprocal on both sides,\" but wait, actually, they took the ratio of numerator to denominator as (1 + tan²φ)/ (2 tan φ) = 1/x². Wait, how did they get that?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me denote A = 1 + tan²φ and B = 2 tan φ. Then the left side is (A + B)/(A - B) = (1 + x²)/(1 - x²). Let me denote C = (1 + x²)/(1 - x²). Then:\n\n(A + B)/(A - B) = C\n\nCross-multiplying: (A + B) = C(A - B)\n\n=> A + B = C A - C B\n\n=> A - C A = - C B - B\n\n=> A(1 - C) = - B(C + 1)\n\n=> A = [ - B (C + 1) ] / (1 - C )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by -1:\n\nA = [ B (C + 1) ] / (C - 1 )\n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. Let me consider:\n\nFrom (A + B)/(A - B) = C\n\nThen [(A + B) + (A - B)] / [(A + B) - (A - B)] = (C + 1)/(C - 1). Wait, this is using componendo and dividendo. The rule states that if (p/q) = (r/s), then (p + q)/(p - q) = (r + s)/(r - s). But here, perhaps they applied componendo and dividendo to the equation (A + B)/(A - B) = C. Let me check.\n\nApplying componendo and dividendo:\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: [(A + B)/(A - B)] + 1 = C + 1\n\nWhich becomes [ (A + B) + (A - B) ] / (A - B) ) = C + 1\n\n=> [2A]/(A - B) = C + 1\n\nSimilarly, subtract 1 from both sides: [(A + B)/(A - B)] - 1 = C - 1\n\nWhich becomes [ (A + B) - (A - B) ] / (A - B) ) = C - 1\n\n=> [2B]/(A - B) = C - 1\n\nDivide the two equations:\n\n[2A/(A - B)] / [2B/(A - B)] = (C + 1)/(C - 1)\n\n=> A/B = (C + 1)/(C - 1)\n\nSo A/B = (C + 1)/(C - 1)\n\nWhich gives (1 + tan²φ)/(2 tan φ) = [ ( (1 + x²)/(1 - x²) + 1 ) / ( (1 + x²)/(1 - x²) - 1 ) ]\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, compute numerator: C + 1 = (1 + x²)/(1 - x²) + 1 = [ (1 + x²) + (1 - x²) ] / (1 - x²) ) = 2 / (1 - x²)\n\nDenominator: C - 1 = (1 + x²)/(1 - x²) - 1 = [ (1 + x²) - (1 - x²) ] / (1 - x²) ) = (2 x²)/(1 - x²)\n\nThus, (C + 1)/(C - 1) = [2/(1 - x²)] / [2x²/(1 - x²)] = 1/x²\n\nTherefore, (1 + tan²φ)/(2 tan φ) = 1/x²\n\nBut 1 + tan²φ = sec²φ, so sec²φ/(2 tan φ) = 1/(2 sin φ cos φ) ) = 1/(sin 2φ)\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, 1 + tan²φ = sec²φ, so:\n\nsec²φ / (2 tan φ) = (1/cos²φ) / (2 sin φ / cos φ ) = 1/(2 sin φ cos φ) ) = 1/(sin 2φ)\n\nSo, 1/(sin 2φ) = 1/x² => sin 2φ = x²\n\nTherefore, the user's step is correct here. They arrived at sin 2φ = x².\n\nThen, they concluded φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x², but the original problem states that φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x². So there's a discrepancy in the sign.\n\nThe user is asking where they went wrong. Let's check their final step. From sin 2φ = x², they wrote φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x². Let's see.\n\nIf sin θ = x², then θ = sin⁻¹x² or π - sin⁻¹x². But here, 2φ = sin⁻¹x² or π - sin⁻¹x². However, the user related this to cos⁻¹x².\n\nWe know that sin θ = cos(π/2 - θ), so sin⁻¹x² = π/2 - cos⁻¹x². Therefore, θ = π/2 - cos⁻¹x². Therefore, 2φ = π/2 - cos⁻¹x² => φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x². But the original problem says φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x². So this is the opposite sign.\n\nBut why the discrepancy? Let's check the possible domain of x. The original expression involves square roots, so 1 - x² must be non-negative, so |x| ≤ 1. Also, the denominator in the original arctangent expression is √(1+x²) - √(1−x²). Let's check if that's positive. Let me compute √(1+x²) and √(1−x²). Since |x| ≤ 1, √(1+x²) is always greater than or equal to √(1−x²), so the denominator is positive. Therefore, the argument of arctangent is positive, so φ is in the first quadrant (since arctangent of a positive number is between 0 and π/2).\n\nBut when they solve sin 2φ = x², 2φ is in the range (0, π). So sin 2φ = x², which implies 2φ = sin⁻¹x² or π - sin⁻¹x². But since x² is between 0 and 1 (since |x| ≤ 1), sin⁻¹x² is between 0 and π/2. Therefore, π - sin⁻¹x² is between π/2 and π. However, since φ is between 0 and π/2, 2φ is between 0 and π. Therefore, both solutions are possible. Wait, but if φ is between 0 and π/2, then 2φ is between 0 and π. So sin 2φ = x², which is between 0 and 1. Therefore, two possible solutions: 2φ = sin⁻¹x² or 2φ = π - sin⁻¹x². Thus, φ = (1/2) sin⁻¹x² or φ = π/2 - (1/2) sin⁻¹x².\n\nBut the user's answer is φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x². Let's see how this relates.\n\nUsing the identity sin⁻¹x² + cos⁻¹x² = π/2. Therefore, sin⁻¹x² = π/2 - cos⁻¹x². Substituting into φ:\n\nCase 1: φ = (1/2)(π/2 - cos⁻¹x²) = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nCase 2: φ = π/2 - (1/2) sin⁻¹x² = π/2 - (1/2)(π/2 - cos⁻¹x²) = π/2 - π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x² = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nAh! So depending on the solution chosen, φ could be either π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x² or π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x². Therefore, the user arrived at one solution, but the original problem states the other. So why is this happening?\n\nThis suggests that there's a choice between the two solutions, and we need to determine which one is correct based on the domain of x or the quadrant where φ lies.\n\nGiven that φ is the arctangent of a positive quantity, as the denominator √(1+x²) - √(1−x²) is positive, so the argument of arctangent is positive, hence φ is between 0 and π/2.\n\nLet's analyze both cases:\n\nCase 1: φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nHere, cos⁻¹x² ranges from 0 (when x²=1) to π/2 (when x²=0). Therefore, (1/2) cos⁻¹x² ranges from 0 to π/4. Thus, φ ranges from π/4 - 0 = π/4 (when x²=1) to π/4 - π/4 = 0 (when x²=0). Wait, but when x²=0, the original expression becomes arctan[(√1 + √1)/(√1 - √1)] = arctan[(2)/0], which is undefined. Wait, but x=0 would make the denominator zero. So x can't be zero. So x is in (-1, 1) excluding zero? Wait, but x²=0 is allowed? Wait, if x=0, then x²=0, and the denominator becomes √1 - √1 = 0. So x=0 is not allowed, so x² is in (0,1]. So cos⁻¹x² is in [0, π/2), and thus (1/2) cos⁻¹x² is in [0, π/4). Therefore, φ in case 1 would be in (π/4 - π/4, π/4 - 0) = (0, π/4).\n\nBut φ is the arctangent of a positive number, so φ is between 0 and π/2. So case 1 gives φ between 0 and π/4, case 2 gives φ between π/4 and π/2.\n\nBut let's test a value of x. Let me choose x=1. Then x²=1, and the original expression becomes:\n\ntan⁻¹[ (√2 + 0)/(√2 - 0) ] = tan⁻¹[1] = π/4.\n\nAccording to the original problem, it should be π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹(1) = π/4 + (1/2)(0) = π/4, which matches. According to the user's answer, it would be π/4 - (1/2)(0) = π/4, which also matches. Wait, but when x=1, both expressions give the same result.\n\nAnother test: let x approach 0. Let x approach 0 from the positive side. Then x² approaches 0. The original expression becomes:\n\ntan⁻¹[ (√(1+0) + √(1-0) ) / (√(1+0) - √(1-0) ) ] = tan⁻¹[ (1+1)/(1-1) ] which is undefined (denominator approaches 0). So as x approaches 0, the expression tends to infinity, so φ approaches π/2.\n\nAccording to the original problem's formula: π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹(0) = π/4 + (1/2)(π/2) = π/4 + π/4 = π/2. Correct.\n\nAccording to the user's answer: π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹(0) = π/4 - π/4 = 0. Which is incorrect. Therefore, when x approaches 0, the correct value of φ approaches π/2, which is captured by the original problem's expression but not the user's.\n\nTherefore, the user's solution gives the wrong result when x approaches 0, which suggests that they selected the wrong branch of the solution. So why did this happen?\n\nWhen solving sin 2φ = x², we have two possible solutions for 2φ: sin⁻¹x² and π - sin⁻¹x². But depending on the range of φ, which is (0, π/2), 2φ is in (0, π). Therefore, both solutions are possible. However, when x² increases from 0 to 1, sin⁻¹x² increases from 0 to π/2, and π - sin⁻¹x² decreases from π to π/2. Therefore, 2φ must be in (0, π). But φ must also satisfy the original equation's behavior.\n\nWhen x approaches 1, we saw that φ should approach π/4. When x approaches 0, φ approaches π/2. Let's see the two cases:\n\nCase 1: φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nAs x approaches 0, cos⁻¹x² approaches π/2, so φ approaches π/4 - π/4 = 0. But this contradicts the original expression, which approaches π/2.\n\nCase 2: φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nAs x approaches 0, φ approaches π/4 + π/4 = π/2, which matches the original expression. As x approaches 1, cos⁻¹x² approaches 0, so φ approaches π/4 + 0 = π/4, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is case 2: φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x².\n\nSo where did the user go wrong? They probably took the wrong branch when solving sin 2φ = x². They assumed φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x², but based on the behavior at the extremes (x approaching 0 and 1), the correct expression is with a plus sign.\n\nBut algebraically, how did this happen? Let me retrace the steps. After getting sin 2φ = x², the general solution is 2φ = sin⁻¹x² + 2πn or 2φ = π - sin⁻¹x² + 2πn, for integer n. But since φ is between 0 and π/2, we need 2φ between 0 and π. Therefore, n=0.\n\nThus, two possibilities:\n\n1. 2φ = sin⁻¹x² => φ = (1/2) sin⁻¹x²\n\n2. 2φ = π - sin⁻¹x² => φ = π/2 - (1/2) sin⁻¹x²\n\nBut using the identity sin⁻¹x² = π/2 - cos⁻¹x², we substitute into each case:\n\nCase 1: φ = (1/2)(π/2 - cos⁻¹x²) = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nCase 2: φ = π/2 - (1/2)(π/2 - cos⁻¹x²) = π/2 - π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x² = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x²\n\nTherefore, the two solutions are as before. To determine which one is correct, we need to analyze the behavior or check another value.\n\nLet's take x such that x² = 1/2. Then x = ±1/√2.\n\nCompute the original expression:\n\ntan φ = [√(1 + 1/2) + √(1 - 1/2)] / [√(1 + 1/2) - √(1 - 1/2)] = [√(3/2) + √(1/2)] / [√(3/2) - √(1/2)]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √2:\n\n[√3 + 1] / [√3 - 1]\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1):\n\n[ (√3 + 1)^2 ] / [ (√3)^2 - 1^2 ] = (3 + 2√3 +1 ) / (3 -1 ) = (4 + 2√3)/2 = 2 + √3\n\nTherefore, tan φ = 2 + √3. What's arctangent of 2 + √3? We know that tan(75°) = tan(5π/12) = 2 + √3. So φ = 5π/12.\n\nNow compute both expressions:\n\nOriginal problem's formula: π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹(1/2) = π/4 + (1/2)(π/3) = π/4 + π/6 = (3π + 2π)/12 = 5π/12. Correct.\n\nUser's formula: π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹(1/2) = π/4 - π/6 = (3π - 2π)/12 = π/12. Which is incorrect since tan(π/12) = 2 - √3, not 2 + √3.\n\nThus, the user's answer gives the wrong result for x=1/√2, while the original formula is correct. Therefore, the mistake was in selecting the wrong branch of the solution. The user took 2φ = sin⁻¹x², leading to φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x², but the correct solution is 2φ = π - sin⁻¹x², leading to φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x².\n\nWhy did the user choose the wrong branch? Possibly because when solving sin 2φ = x², they assumed the principal value (between -π/2 and π/2 for arcsin), but in the context of the problem, φ is between 0 and π/2, so 2φ is between 0 and π, and thus the solution must be in that interval. Therefore, when x² is positive, sin 2φ is positive, so 2φ must be in (0, π), and the two solutions are sin⁻¹x² and π - sin⁻¹x². But how to choose between them?\n\nThe key is to recognize the relationship between φ and x. As x increases from 0 to 1, x² increases from 0 to 1, and φ decreases from π/2 to π/4. Let's see:\n\nIf φ = π/4 + (1/2) cos⁻¹x², then as x² increases from 0 to 1, cos⁻¹x² decreases from π/2 to 0, so φ decreases from π/4 + π/4 = π/2 to π/4 + 0 = π/4. Correct behavior.\n\nIf φ = π/4 - (1/2) cos⁻¹x², then as x² increases, cos⁻¹x² decreases, so φ increases from π/4 - π/4 = 0 to π/4 - 0 = π/4. This would mean φ increases as x increases, which contradicts the original expression where increasing x (approaching 1) makes φ approach π/4 from above (wait, no, wait, when x approaches 1, the original expression's tan φ approaches [√2 + 0]/[√2 - 0] = 1, so φ approaches π/4. But according to this formula, if x increases from 0 to 1, φ decreases from π/2 to π/4. So indeed, the correct formula is with the plus sign.\n\nTherefore, the user's mistake was not considering the correct branch of the inverse sine function. They took the principal branch which gives the lower solution, but due to the domain of φ, the correct solution requires taking the supplement angle, leading to the plus sign.\n\nSo, to answer the user's question: Where did they go wrong? They chose the incorrect branch when solving sin 2φ = x². They should have selected 2φ = π - sin⁻¹x² instead of 2φ = sin⁻¹x², leading to the correct expression with the plus sign.",
