    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nOriginal Title: If |{g ∈ G: π(g)=g⁻¹}| > 3|G|/4, then G is an abelian group.\n\nQuestion: Assume that π is an automorphism of a finite group G. Let S denote the set {g ∈ G: π(g)=g⁻¹}. Show that if |S| > 3|G|/4, then G is an abelian group. Anyone has any idea on how to solve this? I have no idea how to start.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n2. π is an automorphism of G.\n3. S is the set of elements g in G such that π(g) = g⁻¹.\n4. The cardinality of S is greater than 3|G|/4.\n\nThe problem is to show that under these conditions, G must be abelian.\n\nNow, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's check:\n\n- First, G is finite. That's one assumption.\n- Second, π is an automorphism of G. That's another.\n- Third, S is defined as the set {g ∈ G | π(g)=g⁻¹}. So that's about S's definition.\n- Fourth, the size of S is more than 3/4 of |G|.\n\nThese are four separate assumptions. The problem is to prove G is abelian.\n\nWait, the example given in the user's prompt had some assumptions that might have been in the problem, but here the problem states \"Assume that π is an automorphism...\", so the key assumptions are G is finite, π is an automorphism, S is defined as such, and |S| > 3|G|/4. The conclusion is G is abelian.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a finite group,\nπ is an automorphism of G,\nS is the set {g ∈ G : π(g) = g⁻¹},\n|S| > (3/4)|G|.\n\nProblem:\nShow that G is an abelian group.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, sometimes the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was included even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption in the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the example was modified. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be all the given conditions in the problem. So in the original example, perhaps the user made a mistake. So for the current problem, I shouldn't add any assumptions beyond what's given. The problem says \"Assume that π is an automorphism...\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n\n- π is an automorphism of G.\n\n- S = {g ∈ G | π(g) = g⁻¹}.\n\n- |S| > (3/4)|G|.\n\nTherefore, structuring them line by line. Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object. So each of these four points is a separate assumption. Wait, but \"S is the set...\" is defining S, but maybe that's part of the problem statement. However, the user's example included the definition of A(n) as part of the problem, not the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, while the problem statement included the expression of A(n). So perhaps in this case, the definition of S is part of the problem, not an assumption. Wait, but the problem statement says \"Let S denote the set...\", so that's part of the setup, which might be considered as an assumption. The user's example included the definition of A(n) in the problem statement, not in the assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the given conditions: G is finite, π is an automorphism, and |S| > 3/4 |G|. The definition of S is part of the problem's setup, so maybe included in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem is structured as:\n\n\"Assume that π is an automorphism of a finite group G. Let S denote the set {g ∈ G: π(g)=g⁻¹}. Show that if |S| > 3|G|/4, then G is an abelian group.\"\n\nSo \"Assume that π is an automorphism...\" is the first assumption. Then \"Let S denote...\" is part of the setup. The condition \"if |S| > 3|G|/4\" is another assumption. So:\n\nAssumption 1: G is a finite group.\n\nAssumption 2: π is an automorphism of G.\n\nAssumption 3: S = {g ∈ G | π(g) = g⁻¹}.\n\nAssumption 4: |S| > (3/4)|G|.\n\nBut perhaps \"S = ...\" is part of the problem's definition rather than an assumption. However, the problem says \"Let S denote...\", which is part of the given, so it should be considered as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the problem statement. The user's example included the expression for A(n) in the problem, not in assumptions. So perhaps here, the problem is \"Show that if |S| > 3|G|/4, then G is abelian,\" where S is defined as that set. Therefore, the problem statement includes the definition of S. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- G is finite.\n\n- π is an automorphism of G.\n\n- |S| > 3|G|/4.\n\nThen the problem is: Show that G is abelian, given S is defined as {g ∈ G | π(g) = g⁻¹} and the above assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the definition of S is part of the problem statement. Let's see how the example was handled. In the example, the original problem's A(n) was part of the problem statement, not the assumptions. So perhaps here, S is defined in the problem statement. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n\n- π is an automorphism of G.\n\n- |S| > 3|G|/4.\n\nProblem: Let S denote the set {g ∈ G : π(g) = g⁻¹}. Show that G is an abelian group.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list the definition of S as an assumption. Because \"Let S denote...\" is part of the problem's setup. Hmm. The user's example included the expression of A(n) in the problem, so perhaps in this case, S's definition is part of the problem statement. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. G is a finite group.\n\n2. π is an automorphism of G.\n\n3. |S| > 3|G|/4.\n\nProblem: Let S denote the set {g ∈ G : π(g) = g⁻¹}. Show that G is an abelian group.\n\nBut in the example, the problem statement included the expression for A(n), so perhaps the definition of S is part of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the user's example had a mistake. Anyway, to follow the example, perhaps the problem statement should include the definition of S, and the assumptions are the other conditions.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\" Wait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so the assumption \"n is an integer\" is redundant, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user's example isn't a good model. But given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list all given conditions as assumptions, including the definition of S. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a finite group.\n\n- π is an automorphism of G.\n\n- S is the set {g ∈ G : π(g) = g⁻¹}.\n\n- |S| > (3/4)|G|.\n\nProblem: Show that G is an abelian group.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Each addresses one property. So I think this is the right way to structure it. Let's check the example again. The original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that's adding a new condition. That seems wrong. Maybe the example was from a different problem. Maybe the user intended to have the assumptions as the given conditions. So in the current problem, the given conditions are:\n\n- G is finite.\n\n- π is an automorphism.\n\n- S is defined as {g ∈ G : π(g) = g⁻¹}.\n\n- |S| > 3|G|/4.\n\nHence, these should be the assumptions. The problem is to show G is abelian.",
