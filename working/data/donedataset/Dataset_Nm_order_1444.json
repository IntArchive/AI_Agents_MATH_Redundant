    "Content": "Is it true that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational? Let $x=\\log_2 13\\implies 2^x=13$. So, it will be an irrational number, if not,$$x=\\frac p q$$ and $$2^{\\frac p q}=13$$ $$\\implies 2^p=13^{q}$$ Since, $13$ is a prime number, $2^p$ divides $13^q$. So, $2$ divides $13$, which is absurd. Is this reason worthy? Can you give some other proofs for this?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are done in your solution at the step where you concluded that $2^p = 13^q$. You only need to quote Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic after that step.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is \"$\\log_2 13$ is irrational\" and the question starts by asking if that's true. The user then presents a proof attempt: assuming $x = \\log_2 13$ implies $2^x = 13$. If $x$ were rational, then $x = p/q$, leading to $2^p = 13^q$. Since 13 is prime, they argue that this would mean 2 divides 13, which is impossible. The user asks if this reasoning is valid and requests other proofs.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given in the format shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem statement is then the main question.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The base of the logarithm is 2.\n2. The argument of the logarithm is 13.\n3. The definition of a logarithm: $x = \\log_2 13$ implies $2^x = 13$.\n4. The property that a rational number can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers.\n5. The prime factorization aspect: 13 is a prime number.\n6. The implication that if $2^p = 13^q$, then 2 would divide 13, which contradicts the primality of 13.\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the conditions given in the problem (like n being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is to prove that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational. The key assumptions needed for the problem are the properties used in the proof provided by the user. But since the format requires assumptions to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, I need to list those that are given or inherent to the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the logarithm. The problem's inherent assumptions are the base and the argument of the logarithm. The rest are part of the reasoning, but perhaps not the initial assumptions. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to prove that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational. The key elements here are the logarithm base 2 and the number 13. The user's proof uses the fact that 13 is prime. So, maybe the assumptions should include that 13 is a prime number. Also, that the logarithm is defined, which requires 13 to be positive and 2 to be a positive number not equal to 1, which they are. But since the example didn't mention that 5 and 6 are positive or primes, maybe here the assumptions are just that 2 and 13 are positive real numbers, 2 ≠ 1, and 13 is prime. However, in the example, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the logarithm, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- 2 is a positive real number not equal to 1.\n- 13 is a positive real number.\n- 13 is a prime number.\n\nBut the user's proof specifically uses that 13 is prime. So perhaps that's an important assumption. The other assumptions are inherent in the definition of logarithms. Let me check the example again. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are the base and the argument of the logarithm. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The base of the logarithm is 2.\n- The argument of the logarithm is 13.\n- 13 is a prime number.\n\nWait, but the base 2 is also a prime. Maybe that's relevant. But in the user's proof, they used that 13 is prime. The key step is that 2^p = 13^q implies 2 divides 13, which can't happen because 13 is prime. So the primality of 13 is crucial. The base being 2 is given, but not necessarily an assumption about its primality. The problem is to prove the irrationality of log_2 13, so the assumptions needed are the conditions given in the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The logarithm is base 2,\n- The argument of the logarithm is 13,\n- 13 is a prime number.\n\nBut maybe the prime number part is part of the problem's inherent properties. Wait, the problem is asking to prove that log_2 13 is irrational. The proof provided uses that 13 is prime, so maybe that's an assumption. However, in reality, 13 being prime is a known fact, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's necessary to state it as an assumption to allow the proof to go through. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't state it, but the user's solution uses it. The format requires assumptions to be listed. In the example, the original problem didn't mention that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91\". But the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user wants me to follow that format. Wait, maybe there was a miscommunication. The user provided an example where the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like the problem was actually to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But maybe the original problem had a mistake. Anyway, following the example, the assumptions include conditions beyond what's in the problem statement. Wait, perhaps the example was a wrong example. Let me check again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's contradictory. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should not add \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the example is incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is whether log_2 13 is irrational. The problem is to prove that. The user's proof uses that 13 is prime. So to structure this, the assumptions would include:\n\n- 13 is a prime number.\n- The logarithm is defined (so 2 > 0, 2 ≠ 1, 13 > 0).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about log_2 13, so the objects involved are 2 and 13. The key properties are:\n\n1. 2 is a positive real number not equal to 1 (to define the logarithm).\n2. 13 is a positive real number (since logarithm is defined for positive numbers).\n3. 13 is a prime number (used in the proof).\n\nBut the original problem didn't explicitly state that 13 is prime; it's a known fact. However, since the user's proof uses it, maybe we should include it as an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't need that assumption, but the proof does. But according to the example, assumptions are the problem's given conditions. In the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps in the example, there was a mistake, but the user's instruction is to list the problem's assumptions as given. Wait, perhaps the example is not a good one. Alternatively, maybe the original problem in the example had a different condition that was filtered. The user says \"filtered the unrelated informations\".\n\nAh, the task is to \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So perhaps the original problem had some extraneous information that needs to be filtered, and the assumptions are the key conditions needed for the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's proof uses that 13 is prime. So to state the problem, we might need to include that 13 is prime as an assumption. However, the problem itself is just asking if log_2 13 is irrational. The fact that 13 is prime is part of mathematical knowledge, but perhaps the problem assumes that. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't state it, and the user is using it in their proof. Since the task is to structure the problem as per the example, where assumptions include properties of the objects involved (like n being integer and divisible by 7), here we might list:\n\nAssumption:\n- 13 is a prime number.\n- The logarithm is base 2.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that log_2 13 is irrational. The key assumptions are that 2 and 13 are positive integers, 2 ≠ 1, 13 ≠ 1, and 13 is prime. Wait, but 13 being prime is necessary for the proof provided. So to make the problem self-contained, maybe we need to include that 13 is prime as an assumption. Alternatively, if the problem is just stating \"Prove log_2 13 is irrational\", then the assumptions are inherent in the logarithm definition. But according to the example, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that example, the user made a mistake, but following that, maybe we need to list the key properties used in the proof as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the necessary conditions for the problem to make sense. For the logarithm to be defined, 2 must be positive and not 1, and 13 must be positive. These are standard, but maybe included as assumptions. However, the example didn't include such basic assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The base of the logarithm is 2.\n- The argument of the logarithm is 13.\n\nBut since the proof uses that 13 is prime, which is a property of 13, perhaps that should be an assumption. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition on n (divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem's general statement. That suggests that perhaps the example's original problem had a different condition, but the user restructured it with additional assumptions. Maybe the user wants to extract all underlying assumptions necessary for the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated.\n\nBut in this case, to prove that log_2 13 is irrational, the necessary assumptions are:\n\n- 2 and 13 are integers greater than 1.\n- 13 is not a power of 2.\n\nBut the standard proof uses that if log_b a is rational, then a is a power of b. So in this case, since 13 is not a power of 2, the logarithm is irrational. Alternatively, the user's proof uses that 13 is prime, so if 2^p = 13^q, then 2 divides 13, which is impossible. Therefore, the key assumption here is that 13 is a prime number. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- 13 is a prime number.\n- The base of the logarithm is 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational.\n\nBut maybe also include that 2 and 13 are positive integers greater than 1. However, since the example didn't include such basic assumptions, perhaps just the key ones needed for the proof. In the user's proof, the key step is that 13 being prime leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that 13 is prime is crucial. Hence, I'll list that as an assumption.\n\nSo the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The base of the logarithm is 2.\n- 13 is a prime number.\nProblem: Prove that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational.\n\nBut wait, the base being 2 is part of the problem statement. The fact that 13 is prime is a mathematical fact, but in the context of structuring the problem, maybe we need to list it as an assumption since the proof relies on it. Alternatively, the problem could be stated without that assumption, and the proof would use it. But according to the example, the assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's given. For example, in the example, the problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumptions include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". That suggests that the problem was perhaps originally to prove divisibility by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the user rephrased it. It's a bit confusing. To adhere to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem includes specific assumptions. So perhaps in this case, the problem is to prove that log_2 13 is irrational, with the assumptions that the base is 2 and 13 is prime. Hence:\n\nAssumption:\n- The logarithm has base 2.\n- 13 is a prime number.\nProblem: Prove that $\\log_2 13$ is irrational.\n\nThat should be correct. The user's proof uses the primality of 13, so it's an essential assumption. The base being 2 is part of the problem statement. Therefore, this follows the example's structure.",
