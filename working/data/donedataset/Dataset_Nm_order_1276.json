    "Content": "Update. I have generalized the method here and have shown the theorem for many more exponents: Equational proofs of Jacobson's Theorem Let $R$ be a ring such that $a^5=a$ for all $a \\in R$ . Then it follows that $R$ is commutative. This is part of a more general well-known theorem by Jacobson for arbitrary exponents ( $a^n=a$ ), which appeared on math.stackexchange a couple of times . But what I would like to see is a proof which is (1) direct / elementary and  (2) in equational language (in particular, first-order). (As far as I know, no published proof of Jacobson's Theorem is equational, but such a proof has to exist ). See here and there for such proofs for the exponents $3$ and $4$ . I hope that these proofs make the \"rules\" clear. What I've done so far: Reduced to the case that $R$ has characteristic $5$ . Any element of the form $a^4$ is central, because it is idempotent and $R$ is reduced. Also, it suffices to prove $(ab)^2= b^2 a^2$ for $a,b \\in R$ . In fact, this implies $$ab=(ab)^5=a(ba)^4 b = (ba)^4 ab  = b a b (ab)^2 a^2 b$$ $$ = b a b (b^2 a^2) a^2 b  = b a b^3 a^4 b  = b a a^4 b^3 b  = b a b^4  = b b^4 a = ba.$$ Perhaps someone can feed automatic theorem provers with this problem. But my experience is that their proofs are not so easy to follow, quite long and not intuitive. So I am actually looking for hand-made proofs which eventually might also work for rings satisfying $a^p=a$ where $p$ is any prime. Edit. Here is some progress, inspired by the proof by Nagahara and Tominaga. Consider $a \\in R$ and decompose the finite commutative reduced ring $\\langle a \\rangle$ into a product of fields - this is just the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Hence, $a=a_1+\\dotsc+a_n$ where each $\\langle a_i \\rangle$ is a field with unit $e_i=a_i^4$ . The only fields satisfying the equation are $\\mathbb{F}_2$ , $\\mathbb{F}_3$ and $\\mathbb{F}_5$ , which are prime fields . Hence, $a_i = z_i e_i$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is central and therefore $a$ is central. (This incredibly quick proof for the $(a^n=a)$ -problem works for all exponents $n$ where every prime power $q$ such that $q-1|n-1$ is actually a prime number.) 2nd Edit . This leads to an equational proof. For simplicity, let us assume that $R$ has characteristic $5$ .  (This reduction is not in equational language, but the cases of characteristic $2$ and $3$ can be dealt separately and in the end everything may be put into a single equational proof.) Then $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a quotient of $\\mathbb{F}_5[T]/(T^4-1)$ , which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_5 \\times \\mathbb{F}_5 \\times \\mathbb{F}_5 \\times \\mathbb{F}_5$ via $f \\mapsto (f(1),f(2),f(3),f(4))$ . We can compute the corresponding idempotents: $$e_1 = (t-2)^2 (t-3)(t-4), e_2 = (t-1) (t-3) (t-4)^2, \\\\e_3 = (t-1)^2 (t-2) (t-4), e_4 = (t-1) (t-2) (t-3)^2.$$ Back in $R$ we obtain the equation $$a = e_1(a) + 2 e_2(a) + 3 e_3(a) + 4 e_4(a).$$ Each $e_i(a)$ is idempotent, hence central, and therefore $a$ is central. This proof may be carried out in equational language - but then we would have to verify the equation and that the $e_i(a)$ are idempotent, which is obviously very tedious. Is there also a proof which is (3) not tedious?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I have found a really smart proof in these notes by Geunho Gim. Lemma . In a reduced ring, if $e^2=ze$ for some $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then $ze$ is central. Proof : For a given element $x$, expand $(exe-zex)^2$, it evaluates to zero. Hence, $exe=zex$. Similarly, $exe=xze$. $\\square$ Theorem. If $R$ is a ring in which every element $x$ satisfies $x^5=x$, then $R$ is commutative. Proof. Let $x \\in R$. Then $(x^4+x^2)^2=x^8+2x^6+x^4=2(x^4+x^2)$, hence $2(x^4+x^2)$ is central by the Lemma. Since $x^4$ is idempotent, it is central by the Lemma. Hence, $2x^2=2(x^4+x^2)-2 x^4$ is central. But then $4x^3=2(x^2+x)^2-2x^4-2x^2$ is central. It follows that\n$$2x^3+x^2+5x=(x^2+x)^5-(x^2+x) - 10 x^4 - 2 (4 x^3) - 2(2x^2)$$\nis central. Therefore\n$$7x^4+4x^3 + 8x^2 + 11x = 2(x^2+x)^3 + (x^2+x)^2+5(x^2+x)$$\nis central, too. Finally, we see that\n$$x = (7x^4+4x^3+8x^2+11x)-7x^4 - 3(2x^2)- 2(2x^3+x^2+5x)$$\nis central. $\\square$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to format the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Rings with a^5=a are commutative.\" The user is asking for a direct, elementary proof in equational language (first-order) that any ring where every element satisfies a^5 = a is commutative. They mention prior proofs for exponents 3 and 4 and want a similar approach. They also mention reducing to characteristic 5, certain elements being central, and some progress using decomposition into fields.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The main assumption is that the ring R satisfies a^5 = a for all elements a in R. The problem is to prove R is commutative. However, the user also mentions some reductions they've made, like reducing to characteristic 5 and considering elements being central. But according to the example given, the assumptions should list conditions given in the problem, not the user's progress. The example included an assumption about n being divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state it, but that was part of the problem's hidden assumption. Wait, no—the original problem said \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, in the example, maybe the user made a mistake? Wait the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or maybe the example was a different problem where the user had to infer an assumption. Hmm. But the user here is asking me to follow the format where the Assumptions are the problem's given conditions. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem had an implicit condition on n being such that 7 divides n, but the user may have misrepresented it. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, I have to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per their example.\n\nLooking at the current problem: the question states that R is a ring where a^5 = a for all a in R. The problem is to prove R is commutative. The user also mentions some of their own reductions, like reducing to characteristic 5, but those are part of their attempt, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem's assumptions are just that R is a ring where a^5 = a for all a in R. But maybe there's an implicit assumption that the ring is associative? Because Jacobson's theorem usually applies to associative rings. The problem doesn't specify, but in ring theory, unless stated otherwise, rings are assumed associative. However, sometimes Jacobson's theorem is stated for rings not necessarily associative but with the condition a^n = a, but that's more complicated. However, the user refers to the theorem by Jacobson, which is for associative rings. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- For every element a in R, a^5 = a.\n- R is associative (if needed, but the problem might not state this explicitly; however, since the user is talking about a ring in the standard sense, associativity is assumed).\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't mention associativity, so perhaps we don't list it. The key given assumption is that for all a in R, a^5 = a. So the assumption is:\n\nAssumption:\nFor all elements a in R, a^5 = a.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R is commutative.\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions \"reduced to the case that R has characteristic 5.\" However, that's part of their approach, not the original problem's assumptions. The original problem doesn't specify the characteristic. So in the formatted problem, the assumption should only include what's given in the problem statement, not the user's progress. The problem as stated is: \"Let R be a ring such that a^5 = a for all a in R. Then it follows that R is commutative.\" So the assumptions are:\n\n- R is a ring.\n- For every a in R, a^5 = a.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). Wait, that example might have been incorrect. Let me check again. The original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" which doesn't restrict n. But 91 is 7*13. If A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, then in particular, n can be any integer. However, maybe the user who created the example made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, and the formatted problem correctly included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's speculative. Regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem as per the example, which might mean including assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: \"Let R be a ring such that a^5=a for all a ∈ R. Then it follows that R is commutative.\" So the only assumptions are that R is a ring and a^5 = a for all a in R. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a ring,\nFor all a in R, a^5 = a.\n\nProblem:\nProve that R is commutative.\n\nBut the user's question includes some of their own progress, such as reducing to characteristic 5, but those are not part of the original problem's assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention characteristic, so we shouldn't include that as an assumption. The problem is to prove commutativity given the universal relation a^5 = a. Therefore, the answer should list those two assumptions and the problem as stated.",
