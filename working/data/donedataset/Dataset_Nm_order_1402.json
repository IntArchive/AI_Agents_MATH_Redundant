    "Content": "Taking as our definition of exponentiation repeated multiplication (extended to real exponents by continuity), can we show that the limit $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists, without l'Hôpital, $e$, or even natural logarithm? Sure, l'Hôpital will work, but that's circular if we're developing calculus of transcendentals from first principles. There is a good answer to this question already by user Neal, but he uses the exponential function with base $e$ (it's been answered many times: see also here , here , and here ). But using the special properties of $e$ strikes me as circular too; not literally logically circular, in the sense that we are invoking results we're trying to prove, since there are definitions of $e^x$ which make it trivial to verify the derivative. But perhaps pedagogically circular for a complete novice, the special properties of $e$ appear unmotivated because they cannot be justified without reference to the very derivative we are trying to compute (or else a detour through logarithms, but let's not). Can we find nice squeeze theorem bounds like Neal has, but for the function $a^x$ instead of $e^x$, with the additional handicap that we can't just write $a^x=e^{x\\log a}$? I thought to substitute a series expansion for $\\log a$, but didn't come up with any bounds that were nicely polynomial in both $x$ and $a$. I wonder whether the geometric proof of $\\lim (\\sin x)/x$ (see for example, robjohn's answer here ) could be adapted. Obviously without a reference to natural logarithm, we cannot compute the value of the limit. But I just want to show it exists (via squeeze theorem or monotone convergence). Once we know this limit exists, we can show it behaves like a logarithm, whence there is a unique base for which the limit is 1, which we call $e$. The rest of the development of calculus of exponentials and logs follows easily. This seems like the approach that would appear the most accessible yet motivated to a novice calculus student. An analogous limit to $\\lim\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$ for understanding to differentiating exponential functions, are the limits $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (1+\\frac{1}{n})^n$ and $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (1+\\frac{1}{n})^{n+1}$ for differentiating the logarithm, if you prefer to start with that as your primitive concept. Both limits are shown to exist using Bernoulli's inequality (see WimC's answer here for the first limit, and see David Mitra's answer here for the second limit). I tried without success to use Bernoulli's inequality to show my sequence was monotone. This limit can also be analyzed using the AM-GM inequality as seen in user94270's answer to this question . So that inequality may help here. I would also accept an explanation of why the limit cannot be computed without transcendental techniques, or an opinion why this is not a pedagogically sound approach to introducing the calculus of exponentials and logarithms. Edit: This question has a nice solution by Paramanand Singh to a closely related problem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $a>1.$ I assume $a^x$ is continuous, and that the basic exponent law $a^{x+y}=a^xa^y$ holds. Claim: $a^x$ is convex on $[0,\\infty).$ Proof: Because $a^x$ is continuous, it suffices to show $a^x$ is midpoint convex. Suppose $x,y\\in [0,\\infty).$ Using $(uv)^{1/2} \\le (u+v)/2$ for nonnegative $u,v,$ we get $a^{(x+y)/2} = (a^{x} a^{y})^{1/2} \\le (a^x+a^y)/2.$ Now if $f$ is convex on $[0,\\infty),$ then $(f(x)-f(0))/x$ is an increasing function of $x$ for $x\\in(0,\\infty).$ This is a simple and easily proved property of convex functions. Claim: $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+}(a^x-1)/x$ exists. Proof: All of these quotients are bounded below by $0.$ As $x$ decreases to $0,(a^x-1)/x$ decreases by the above. Because of the lower bound of $0,$ the limit exists. It follows that $\\lim_{x\\to 0}(a^x-1)/x$ exists. This follows from the above and the fact that if $x>0,$ then  $a^{-x} = 1/a^{x}.$ To handle $0<a<1,$ look at $[(1/a)^x-1]/x$ to see $\\lim_{x\\to 0}(a^x-1)/x$ exists.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the required structure. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, filter out the unrelated information, and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user is asking to show that the limit $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, references to $e$, or natural logarithms. The question also mentions that they want this approached from first principles, possibly using the squeeze theorem or monotone convergence, and without invoking the natural logarithm or exponential function with base $e$.\n\nNow, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions that were specific and applied to one object each. So, looking at the problem, the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The definition of exponentiation is based on repeated multiplication extended to real exponents by continuity. This is mentioned explicitly in the question.\n2. The limit is considered as $h$ approaches 0. So, $h$ is a real number approaching 0.\n3. The base $a$ is positive because otherwise, raising a negative number to a real exponent might not be defined or continuous. The original problem doesn't state this, but it's an implicit assumption when dealing with real exponents. So, we should include that $a$ is a positive real number.\n4. The problem specifies not to use l'Hôpital's rule, $e$, or natural logarithms. So, these are restrictions on the methods allowed, but since assumptions are about the problem's conditions, maybe these are constraints rather than assumptions. Wait, the example included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's conditions. Here, the user is imposing constraints on the solution method. But the format says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object\". So perhaps the constraints on the methods (not using l'Hôpital, etc.) aren't assumptions about the problem's conditions but rather restrictions on the solution. Therefore, they might not need to be listed as assumptions. The example didn't list \"don't use l'Hôpital\" as an assumption but included the divisibility condition. So, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the mathematical conditions given in the problem, not the methodological restrictions. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $a$ is a positive real number. (Because the exponentiation for real exponents requires a positive base.)\n- The function $a^h$ is defined via repeated multiplication extended to real exponents by continuity. (This is stated in the problem.)\n- The limit is taken as $h$ approaches 0. (Though this is part of the problem statement, perhaps it's redundant. The example included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which are specific conditions. Here, maybe the key assumptions are that $a$ is positive and the definition of $a^h$.)\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't state any restrictions on $a$ other than being a base for exponentiation. So the critical assumption is that $a > 0$ to allow real exponents. Also, the definition of exponentiation is given as repeated multiplication extended by continuity, which is important because different definitions might lead to different approaches. \n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. $a$ is a positive real number.\n2. Exponentiation $a^h$ is defined by repeated multiplication extended to real exponents via continuity.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Taking as our definition of exponentiation repeated multiplication (extended to real exponents by continuity)\", so that's an assumption given in the problem. So, the first assumption is that $a^h$ is defined via this method. The second assumption would be that $a$ is positive (since otherwise, real exponents aren't defined in this context).\n\nBut perhaps \"a^h is defined for real h via continuity\" is part of the problem's setup. So the key assumptions here are about the definition of $a^h$ and the positivity of $a$. Therefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- $a$ is a positive real number.\n- The function $a^h$ is defined by extending repeated multiplication to real exponents through continuity.\n\nBut to split them into one condition per line, each applied to one object:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$a^h$ is defined for real numbers $h$ by continuity from integer exponents.\n\nWait, but \"defined by continuity from integer exponents\" is the method of definition. So that's part of the problem's setup. So, yes, those are the assumptions.\n\nNow, the problem statement is to show that the limit exists without using certain methods. But the problem statement should encapsulate the actual mathematical problem. So the problem is to show that the limit exists. The restrictions on methods (no l'Hôpital, $e$, or logs) are part of the problem's constraints but not assumptions about the mathematical objects themselves.\n\nSo, in the example given, the assumptions were about the properties of $n$ (being an integer and divisible by 7), and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, similarly, the assumptions are about $a$ being positive and the definition of $a^h$, and the problem is to show the limit exists.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$a^h$ is defined by extending repeated multiplication to real exponents via continuity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, the number $e$, or referencing natural logarithms.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"without l'Hôpital or even referencing $e$ or natural log\". So maybe the problem statement should include the restrictions on the methods. However, in the example, the problem statement was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" without mentioning the method restrictions, but the assumptions included \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the restrictions on methods are part of the problem's instructions but not the mathematical assumptions. However, the user's example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is a mathematical condition. The method restrictions (don't use l'Hôpital, etc.) are not mathematical assumptions but constraints on the solution. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" part should include the actual mathematical statement to prove, along with the constraints if necessary.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem mentions \"without l'Hôpital, $e$, or even referencing natural log\".\n\nIn the formatted example, the problem was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" The original problem's assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. The method restrictions weren't part of the formatted problem. Wait, but in the example given by the user, the original problem didn't have method restrictions. The user's example was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user had to add the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, that might be because the user in the example made an error? Wait, let me check. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) [...] is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? But maybe the original problem had a typo, and the formatted problem corrected it. Alternatively, maybe the example was illustrating that the user needs to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they're implicit.\n\nBut given that, perhaps in the current problem, even though the original question mentions \"without using l'Hôpital etc.\", that is a constraint on the solution method rather than an assumption. So in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" part would include the actual mathematical statement, but the constraints on the method are part of the problem's instructions. However, the user's example didn't include method constraints in the formatted problem, only mathematical assumptions.\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the problem statement should be \"Show that the limit [...] exists\" without mentioning the method constraints. But wait, the original problem says \"can we show that the limit [...] exists, without l'Hôpital, $e$, or even natural logarithm?\" So the problem is to show existence under those constraints. Therefore, perhaps the method constraints are part of the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example again, the problem in the example was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" The original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n [...]\" but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" So they moved the quantifier into the assumptions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem is to show the limit exists for real h approaching 0, using the definition of exponentiation by continuity, without certain methods. So perhaps the problem statement should include the constraints.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the \"Problem\" part should be the problem itself, and the assumptions are the conditions given. So perhaps in this case, the problem is \"Show that [...] exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, referencing $e$, or natural logarithms.\" But the example didn't include method constraints in the problem statement. Wait, the example didn't have method constraints; the original problem there was purely mathematical. Here, the problem has constraints on the method. The user's instruction says: \"structure that problem as the following format\" which includes \"Problem: <The problem>\".\n\nIn the example, the problem was \"Prove that [...] is divisible by 91.\" So, in the current case, should the problem be \"Show that [...] exists\" with the constraints included? Or should the constraints be part of the problem statement?\n\nIn the original question's title, it's \"Show [...] exists without l'Hôpital or even referencing $e$ or natural log\". The problem statement in the formatted version should probably include those constraints because they are part of what needs to be done. So the problem is not just to show the limit exists, but to do so under those constraints. Therefore, the problem statement should include the restrictions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$a^h$ is defined by extending repeated multiplication to real exponents via continuity.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, referencing $e$, or natural logarithms.\n\nBut checking the example again, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, and the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. It seems the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (divisible by 7). That might be an error in the example, or perhaps the original problem had a typo, but regardless, following the user's example, perhaps we need to extract all assumptions from the problem, even if they are implicit.\n\nIn the current problem, the assumptions extracted are:\n\n1. $a$ is a positive real number (implicit because exponentiation to real exponents requires positivity).\n2. $a^h$ is defined via repeated multiplication extended by continuity (explicit in the problem statement).\n3. The limit is as $h$ approaches 0 (explicit in the problem, but perhaps redundant since the limit is part of the problem statement).\n\nBut the example included both \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user's example considered that the problem might have additional constraints. However, in this case, the problem is for a general positive real $a$, so perhaps only those two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$a^h$ is defined for real numbers $h$ by continuity from integer exponents.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, the number $e$, or natural logarithms.\n\nBut to ensure that each assumption is one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$a$ is a positive real number,\n$a^h$ is defined by continuous extension from integer exponents to real exponents.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{a^h-1}{h}$$ exists without using l'Hôpital's rule, referencing $e$, or natural logarithms.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The two assumptions are $a$ being positive and the definition of $a^h$, each as separate lines. The problem is to show the limit exists with the given constraints.",
