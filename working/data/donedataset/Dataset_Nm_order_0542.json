    "AcceptedAnswer": "This integral is readily evaluated using Parseval's theorem for Fourier transforms.  (I am certain that Feynman had this theorem in his tool belt.)  Recall that, for transform pairs $f(x)$ and $F(k)$, and $g(x)$ and $G(k)$, the theorem states that $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx \\, f(x) g^*(x) = \\frac1{2 \\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dk \\, F(k) G^*(k) $$ In this case, $f(x) = \\frac{\\sin^2{x}}{x^2}$ and $g(x) = 1/(1+x^2)$.  Then $F(k) = \\pi (1-|k|/2) \\theta(2-|k|)$ and $G(k) = \\pi \\, e^{-|k|}$. ($\\theta$ is the Heaviside function, $1$ when its argument is positive, $0$ when negative.)  Using the symmetry of the integrand, we may conclude that $$\\begin{align}\\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\frac{\\sin^2{x}}{x^2 (1+x^2)} &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_0^{2} dk \\, \\left ( 1-\\frac{k}{2} \\right ) e^{-k} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left (1-\\frac1{e^2} \\right ) - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\int_0^{2} dk \\, k \\, e^{-k} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left (1-\\frac1{e^2} \\right ) + \\frac{\\pi}{2 e^2}  - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left (1-\\frac1{e^2} \\right )\\\\ &= \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left (1+\\frac1{e^2} \\right )\\end{align} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this integral ∫₀^∞ (sin²x)/(x²(1+x²)) dx using Feynman's method. So, Feynman's trick usually involves introducing a parameter into the integral and then differentiating under the integral sign with respect to that parameter. But where should I insert the parameter here?\n\nFirst, looking at the integrand: sin²x over x squared times (1 + x squared). The denominator has x² and 1 + x². Maybe I can rewrite sin²x using a trigonometric identity to simplify it. The identity sin²x = (1 - cos(2x))/2 might help. Let me try that substitution first.\n\nSo substituting, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2x))/2 ] / [x²(1 + x²)] dx. That splits into two integrals: (1/2)∫₀^∞ 1/(x²(1 + x²)) dx minus (1/2)∫₀^∞ cos(2x)/(x²(1 + x²)) dx. \n\nHmm, the first integral might be manageable. Let's tackle it first. The integrand is 1/(x²(1 + x²)). Maybe partial fractions? Let me see. 1/(x²(1 + x²)) can be written as A/x² + B/(1 + x²). Solving for A and B: 1 = A(1 + x²) + Bx². Setting x² terms: A + B = 0, and constant term A = 1. So B = -1. Thus, the integral becomes ∫ (1/x² - 1/(1 + x²)) dx. Integrating from 0 to ∞: ∫1/x² dx is [-1/x] from 0 to ∞, which tends to 0 - (-∞), but that's problematic. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, when integrating 1/x² from some ε to ∞, as ε approaches 0, the integral is [ -1/x ] from ε to ∞, which is 0 - (-1/ε) = 1/ε, which goes to infinity. But subtracting ∫1/(1 + x²) dx, which is π/2. So the first integral would diverge? But the original problem states the integral is finite. That suggests my substitution might not be valid here, or maybe the cancellation happens when combining both integrals. Wait, maybe splitting the original integral into two parts isn't valid because both parts individually diverge, but their difference converges. That can happen with improper integrals. So perhaps I need to handle them together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe integrating by parts first. Let's consider integrating by parts the original integral. Let me set u = sin²x and dv = dx/(x²(1 + x²)). Then du = 2 sinx cosx dx = sin(2x) dx, and v would be the integral of dv. But integrating dv = 1/(x²(1 + x²)) dx. Wait, maybe integrating v first. Let's compute v = ∫ [1/(x²(1 + x²))] dx. As before, partial fractions gives 1/x² - 1/(1 + x²), so integrating gives -1/x - arctan x + C. So v = -1/x - arctan x. Then integrating by parts, [u v] from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ v du. Let's compute boundary terms: as x approaches ∞, sin²x approaches oscillating values but is bounded, while -1/x approaches 0 and arctan x approaches π/2. So sin²x times (-1/x - arctan x) tends to 0 - (1)(π/2). But sin²x is between 0 and 1, so maybe the product tends to 0? Wait, maybe not. Wait, sin²x oscillates but doesn't go to zero, but when multiplied by -1/x, that term goes to zero. The arctan x term approaches π/2, so sin²x times (-π/2) oscillates between -π/2 and 0? Hmm, this seems problematic. As x approaches ∞, the boundary term might not exist because of oscillation. Maybe integrating by parts isn't the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider using Feynman's trick by introducing a parameter into the integrand. Since we have sin²x, which is related to an integral of cos(2x), maybe we can parameterize the 2x term. Let me think. Suppose we let t be a parameter in the argument of the cosine function. Wait, maybe consider the integral I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [sin²(ax)] / [x²(1 + x²)] dx, and then differentiate with respect to a. Then set a = 1 at the end. Let's try that.\n\nCompute I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [sin²(ax)] / [x²(1 + x²)] dx. Differentiate I(a) with respect to a: I'(a) = ∫₀^∞ [2 sin(ax) cos(ax) * x] / [x²(1 + x²)] dx = ∫₀^∞ [sin(2ax)] / [x(1 + x²)] dx. Hmm, that seems simpler? Now, this integral might be more manageable. Let's denote J(a) = ∫₀^∞ [sin(2ax)] / [x(1 + x²)] dx. Then I'(a) = J(a). \n\nTo compute J(a), perhaps use differentiation under the integral sign again. Let me set J(a) = ∫₀^∞ [sin(2ax)] / [x(1 + x²)] dx. Let's differentiate J(a) with respect to a: J'(a) = ∫₀^∞ [2 cos(2ax) * x] / [x(1 + x²)] dx = 2 ∫₀^∞ [cos(2ax)] / (1 + x²) dx. That's a standard integral. The integral of cos(2ax)/(1 + x²) dx from 0 to ∞ is (π/2) e^{-2a}, if I recall correctly. So J'(a) = 2 * (π/2) e^{-2a} = π e^{-2a}. Therefore, integrating J'(a) from 0 to a gives J(a) - J(0) = π ∫₀^a e^{-2t} dt. But J(0) is ∫₀^∞ 0 dx = 0. So J(a) = π (1 - e^{-2a}) / 2. Wait, let's check: ∫ e^{-2t} dt from 0 to a is (1 - e^{-2a})/2. So J(a) = π (1 - e^{-2a}) / 2.\n\nBut wait, J(a) = ∫₀^∞ [sin(2ax)] / [x(1 + x²)] dx. Then integrating J(a) to get I(a). Since I'(a) = J(a) = π/2 (1 - e^{-2a}), then I(a) = π/2 ∫ (1 - e^{-2a}) da + C. Integrating term by term: π/2 [a + (e^{-2a})/2 ] + C. To find the constant C, consider a approaching 0. When a→0, I(a) = ∫₀^∞ [0]/[...] dx = 0. So when a=0, I(0)=0. Plugging into the expression: 0 = π/2 [0 + (1)/2] + C ⇒ C = -π/4. Therefore, I(a) = π/2 (a + e^{-2a}/2 ) - π/4. Simplify: π/2 a + π/4 e^{-2a} - π/4. Then, the original integral is I(1) = π/2 *1 + π/4 e^{-2} - π/4 = π/2 - π/4 + π/(4e²) = π/4 + π/(4e²). Which matches the desired result. So that works!\n\nBut let me verify each step carefully. When differentiating I(a), we used Leibniz rule correctly. The integral J(a) was handled by differentiating again, leading to an integral that's a known result. The integral of cos(2ax)/(1 + x²) from 0 to ∞ is indeed (π/2)e^{-2a}. So J'(a) is π e^{-2a}. Integrating that gives J(a) = (π/2)(1 - e^{-2a}), considering the initial condition J(0) = 0. Then integrating I'(a) = J(a) gives the expression for I(a), and evaluating at a=1 gives the result. Looks solid. So the key steps were introducing the parameter a into sin²(ax), differentiating twice, and using known integrals involving exponential functions.",
