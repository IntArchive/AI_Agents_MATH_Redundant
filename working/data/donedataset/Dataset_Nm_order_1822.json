    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a sketch of an argument, see if you can generalise and fill in the details.  We illustrate the sum\n$$\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{1}\\Bigr]+\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{2}\\Bigr]+\\cdots+\\Bigl[\\frac{n}{n}\\Bigr]$$\nby a pattern of dots, where the number of dots in column $j$ is equal to $[n/j]$.  If say $n=6$ it will look like this,\n$$\\matrix{\\bullet\\cr \\bullet\\cr \\bullet\\cr \\bullet&\\bullet\\cr\n  \\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr \\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr}$$\nand for future reference we label the rows and columns as shown:\n$$\\matrix{6&\\bullet\\cr 5&\\bullet\\cr 4&\\bullet\\cr 3&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr\n  2&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr\n  1&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr\n  &1&2&3&4&5&6\\cr}$$ If you draw a few more examples it seems clear that the pattern is symmetric about the diagonal.  To show that this is in fact true, note that there is a dot in row $i$, column $j$ if and only if\n$$i\\le\\frac{n}{j}\\ ,$$\nand this is the same as saying that there is a dot in row $j$, column $i$.  Now ignore the dots on the diagonal, for example,\n$$\\matrix{\\bullet\\cr \\bullet\\cr \\bullet\\cr \\bullet&\\bullet\\cr\n  \\bullet&\\circ&\\bullet\\cr \\circ&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet&\\bullet\\cr}$$\nBy symmetry, the remaining dots are even in number. Now how many dots are there on the diagonal?  There is a dot at $(i,i)$ if and only if $i\\le n/i$, if and only if $i^2\\le n$, if and only if $i\\le[\\sqrt n]$.  So the number of dots on the diagonal is $[\\sqrt n]$.  Putting all this together shows that the number in the problem is even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by understanding the original question.\n\nThe title is \"To prove that [n/1]+ [n/2]+[n/3]+\\dots +[n/n]+[√n] is even.\" The user is asking to prove that the sum of the floor functions of n divided by each integer from 1 to n, plus the floor of the square root of n, results in an even number for any natural number n.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem states that n is a natural number, so that's one assumption. Also, the expression involves floor functions, so each term like [n/k] (which is floor(n/k)) is part of the problem. The final term is floor(sqrt(n)). However, the example provided in the user's instruction shows that sometimes additional conditions might be included if present. But in this problem, there's no mention of any specific conditions on n beyond being a natural number. Wait, but the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. Here, the original problem doesn't state any such divisibility conditions. So the only assumption here is that n is a natural number. But let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question says \"Let n be a natural number. How do you prove that... is even?\" So the only explicit assumption is that n is a natural number. The other parts (like floor functions and sqrt(n)) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So the assumptions section should only include the given conditions on the variables. Since the problem doesn't specify any restrictions beyond n being a natural number, the assumption is just that n is a natural number. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, n is a natural number, which is already an integer. So maybe the assumption here is simply that n is a natural number. However, in the example, the user added \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which seems conflicting. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be because the original problem had a mistake, or maybe the user restructured it. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it. But in any case, the instruction is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in that example, the user made a mistake. But in our current problem, the user's original question is to prove that the sum is even for any natural number n, so the only assumption is that n is a natural number.\n\nWait, but the example's formatted problem added an extra condition (divisible by 7) even though the original problem didn't mention it. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a hidden condition. But regardless, for the current problem, the user says: \"Let n be a natural number. How do you prove that [sum] + [sqrt(n)] is even?\" So the only assumption here is that n is a natural number. There are no other conditions. Therefore, the assumption line should be \"n is a natural number.\"\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\lfloor n/1 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor + \\dots + \\lfloor n/n \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor $$ is even.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The original problem statement in the example had an assumption added that wasn't in the original problem. That might be an error. However, according to the user's instruction, the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. Therefore, in this current problem, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. The problem is to prove that the given sum is even. So the formatted problem should have that assumption and problem as above.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the problem has any other implicit assumptions. For example, floor functions are applied, but that's part of the problem's terms. The problem statement includes \"Let n be a natural number,\" so the assumption is just n being natural. The rest is part of the problem to prove.\n\nThus, the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\lfloor n/1 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor + \\dots + \\lfloor n/n \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor $$ is even.",
