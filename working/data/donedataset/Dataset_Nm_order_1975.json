    "AcceptedAnswer": "$9^4\\!+8\\,$ prime $\\Rightarrow x^4+8$ is irreducible over $\\Bbb Z$ by Cohn's irreducibility test. Or, with smaller prime, consider $\\,f(2x) = 8(2x^4\\!+1).\\,$ Then $2x^4\\!+1$ is irreducible by Cohn, since $\\,2\\cdot 3^4+1 = 163\\,$ is prime (in fact, a very famous prime, the largest Heegner number , which explains why Euler's famous prime producing polynomial $\\,n^2-n+41\\,$ yields distinct primes for $\\,n = 1,2,\\ldots,40).$ Remark $\\ $ Cohn's criterion can be viewed as an example of the general idea that  the factorizations of a polynomial are constrained by the factorizations of the values that it takes. If one pushes this idea to the hilt one obtains a simple algorithm for polynomial factorization using factorization of its integer values and (Lagrange) interpolation. The ideas behind this algorithm are due in part to Bernoulli, Schubert, Kronecker. The algorithm is of more theoretical value than practical, since nowadays much more efficient algorithms are known. There are also other closely related results. In $1918$ Stackel published the following simple: Theorem If $\\rm\\, f(x)\\,$ is a composite integer coefficient polynomial then $\\rm\\, f(n)\\, $ is  composite for all $\\rm\\,|n| > B,\\, $ for some bound $\\rm\\,B.\\,$ In fact $\\rm\\, f(n)\\, $ has at most $\\rm\\, 2d\\, $ prime values, where $\\rm\\, d = {\\rm deg}(f)$ . The simple proof can be found online in Mott & Rose [3] , p. 8.\nI highly recommend this delightful and stimulating $27$ page paper\nwhich discusses prime-producing polynomials and related topics. Contrapositively, $\\rm\\, f(x)\\, $ is prime (irreducible) if it assumes a prime value\nfor large enough $\\rm\\, |x|\\, $ .\nAs an example, Polya-Szego popularized A. Cohn's irreduciblity test, which\nstates that $\\rm\\, f(x) \\in \\mathbb Z[x]\\,$ is prime if $\\rm\\, f(b)\\, $ yields a prime in radix $\\rm\\,b\\,$ representation (so necessarily $\\rm\\,0 \\le f_i < b).$ For example $\\rm\\,f(x) = x^4 + 6\\, x^2 + 1 \\pmod p\\,$ factors for all primes $\\rm\\,p,\\,$ yet $\\rm\\,f(x)\\,$ is prime since $\\rm\\,f(8) = 10601\\rm$ octal $= 4481$ is prime.\nCohn's test fails if, in radix $\\rm\\,b,\\,$ negative digits are allowed, e.g. $\\rm\\,f(x)\\, =\\, x^3 - 9 x^2 + x-9\\, =\\, (x-9)\\,(x^2 + 1)\\,$ but $\\rm\\,f(10) = 101\\,$ is prime. Conversely Bouniakowski conjectured $(1857)$ that prime $\\rm\\, f(x)\\, $ assume infinitely many prime values (excluding\ncases where all the values of $\\rm\\,f\\,$ have fixed common divisors, e.g. $\\rm\\, 2\\: |\\: x(x+1)+2\\, ).$ However, except for linear polynomials (Dirichlet's theorem), this conjecture has never been proved  for any  polynomial of degree $> 1.$ Note that a result yielding the existence of one prime value extends to existence of infinitely many prime values, for any class of polynomials closed under shifts, viz. if $\\rm\\:f(n_1)\\:$ is prime, then $\\rm\\:g(x) = f(x+ n_1\\!+1)\\:$ is prime for some $\\rm\\:x = n_2\\in\\Bbb N,\\:$ etc. For further detailed discussion of Bouniakowski's conjecture and related results, including heuristic and probabilistic arguments, see Chapter 6 of Ribenboim's The New Book of Prime Number Records .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the polynomial x^4 + 8 is irreducible over the integers without factoring it into lower-degree polynomials. Hmm, so I need to recall methods for proving irreducibility. The usual methods include Eisenstein's criterion, reduction modulo a prime, and maybe checking for rational roots. \n\nFirst, Eisenstein's. The standard form requires a prime that divides all coefficients except the leading one and doesn't divide the constant term, and the square of the prime doesn't divide the constant term. Here, the polynomial is x^4 + 8. The constant term is 8. Let's see if we can apply Eisenstein here. The primes dividing 8 are 2. Let's try p=2. The coefficients are 1 (leading term), 0, 0, 0, 8. So 2 divides 0,0,0,8, but 2 doesn't divide the leading coefficient 1. However, 2^2 =4 divides the constant term 8? Wait, 8 divided by 4 is 2, so yes, 4 divides 8. Therefore, Eisenstein's criterion doesn't apply directly here because the square of the prime (4) divides the constant term. So Eisenstein with p=2 doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe there's a substitution we can make. Sometimes, shifting the variable by some number can help. For example, substituting x = y + a for some integer a might transform the polynomial into one where Eisenstein applies. Let me try that. Let’s let x = y + 1. Then substitute into x^4 +8:\n\n(y + 1)^4 +8. Let's expand that:\n\ny^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y +1 +8 = y^4 +4y^3 +6y^2 +4y +9. Now, check Eisenstein for primes here. The constant term is 9. Primes dividing 9 are 3. Check if 3 divides 4, 6, 4, 9. 3 divides 6 and 9, but not 4. So Eisenstein with p=3 doesn't work. How about p=2? Coefficients are 1,4,6,4,9. 2 divides 4 and 6 and 4, but 2 doesn't divide the leading coefficient 1. However, the constant term is 9, which is not divisible by 2. So Eisenstein still doesn't apply here. Maybe another substitution?\n\nAlternatively, what if we factor x^4 +8 as a product of quadratics? The user doesn't want us to factor, but maybe we can argue that such a factorization isn't possible. Suppose it factors as (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). Then multiplying out gives x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd. Comparing coefficients:\n\n1. a + c = 0\n2. ac + b + d = 0\n3. ad + bc = 0\n4. bd = 8\n\nFrom equation 1, c = -a. Substitute into equation 3: a*d + b*(-a) = 0 => a(d - b) = 0. So either a=0 or d = b.\n\nIf a=0, then c=0. Then equation 2 becomes 0 + b + d = 0 => b + d = 0. But equation 4 is b*d =8. So we have b + d =0 and b*d=8. Then the solutions would be b and d are roots of t^2 +8=0, which are not real, so not integers. Thus no integer solutions here. So a cannot be 0. Therefore, we must have d = b.\n\nSo d = b. Then equation 4 becomes b^2 =8. So b must be sqrt(8) or -sqrt(8), which are not integers. Therefore, no integer solutions. Hence, the polynomial cannot be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it factors into a cubic and a linear term. Let's check for rational roots first. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8. Let's plug in x=1: 1 +8 =9 ≠0. x=-1: 1 +8=9≠0. x=2: 16 +8=24≠0. x=-2: same. Similarly, 4 and 8 give larger numbers. So no rational roots. Therefore, it can't factor into a linear and a cubic term.\n\nHence, x^4 +8 is irreducible over the integers. But wait, the problem asks to show it's irreducible over Z without factoring. So maybe using Eisenstein with substitution. Alternatively, using reduction modulo a prime.\n\nLet me think again about Eisenstein. Maybe if I factor out something? Wait, x^4 +8 = x^4 + 2^3. Hmm. Alternatively, write it as x^4 + 8 = x^4 + 8*1. Maybe there's a way to apply Eisenstein after a substitution. Let's try x = y - 1. Then (y -1)^4 +8. Expand: y^4 -4y^3 +6y^2 -4y +1 +8 = y^4 -4y^3 +6y^2 -4y +9. Again, same as before. Not helpful.\n\nWait, another thought. The polynomial x^4 +8 can be related to x^4 + 2^3. Maybe factor modulo 5? Let's check modulo 5. Then x^4 +8 ≡ x^4 +3 mod5. Let's see if this factors modulo 5. If it factors as quadratic*quadratic, then we can check possible factors. The quadratic polynomials mod5 are limited. Alternatively, if it factors into linear terms, but since there are no roots, as we saw earlier, modulo5, possible roots would be x=0,1,2,3,4. Plugging in x=0: 0 +3=3≠0. x=1:1+3=4≠0. x=2:16+3=19≡4 mod5. x=3:81 +3=84≡4 mod5. x=4:256 +3=259≡4 mod5. So no roots mod5. Hence, it doesn't factor into linear terms. Maybe as a product of quadratics. Suppose x^4 +3 ≡ (x^2 +ax +b)(x^2 +cx +d) mod5. Then coefficients:\n\na +c ≡0 mod5\n\nac +b +d ≡0 mod5\n\nad + bc ≡0 mod5\n\nbd ≡3 mod5\n\nFrom first equation, c ≡-a. Substitute into third equation: a*d +b*(-a) ≡0 mod5 => a(d -b) ≡0 mod5. So either a≡0 or d≡b.\n\nIf a≡0, then c≡0. Then second equation: 0 +b +d≡0 => b +d ≡0 mod5. Fourth equation: b*d≡3 mod5. So b +d ≡0 and b*d≡3. Then substituting d≡-b, so b*(-b) ≡ -b² ≡3 mod5 => b²≡-3≡2 mod5. But squares mod5 are 0,1,4. So no solution. Hence, a cannot be 0. Therefore, d≡b. Then fourth equation: b²≡3 mod5. Check squares mod5: 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9≡4, 4²=16≡1. So 3 is not a square mod5. Therefore, no solutions. Hence, x^4 +3 is irreducible mod5. Therefore, original polynomial is irreducible over Z.\n\nTherefore, by reduction modulo 5, since it's irreducible mod5, it must be irreducible over Z. So that's a valid approach. So the answer is to use reduction modulo 5, show that x^4 +8 ≡x^4 +3 mod5 is irreducible, hence x^4 +8 is irreducible over Z.",
