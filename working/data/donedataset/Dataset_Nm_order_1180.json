    "AcceptedAnswer": "The binomial formula shows you that\n$$(1+\\sqrt2)^n=a_n+b_n\\sqrt2$$\nfor some integers $a_n, b_n$. But, the same binomial formula shows you that (convince yourself of this)\n$$\n(1-\\sqrt2)^n=a_n-b_n\\sqrt2\n$$\nfor the same integers $a_n,b_n$. Then comes the hint: Calculate both $$(a_n+b_n\\sqrt2)(a_n-b_n\\sqrt2)$$ and\n$$(1+\\sqrt2)^n(1-\\sqrt2)^n=[(1+\\sqrt2)(1-\\sqrt2)]^n$$ and compare. You will get that $a_n^2-2b_n^2=(-1)^n$, so $a_n^2$ and $2b_n^2$ differ from each other by one, and $p$ will be the larger of the two.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that for every natural number n, there exists a natural number p (where p is in N*, so p is a positive integer) such that (1 + sqrt(2))^n equals sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is required here. They need to express (1 + sqrt(2))^n in the form of two square roots added together, specifically sqrt(p) and sqrt(p - 1). So p must be a positive integer such that both p and p - 1 are perfect squares? Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, sqrt(p) and sqrt(p - 1) don't have to be integers, but p has to be a positive integer. Wait, but the question says p is in N*, so p is a positive integer, but the expressions sqrt(p) and sqrt(p - 1) don't need to be integers. Wait, but if p is a positive integer, then sqrt(p) and sqrt(p - 1) are real numbers. The problem is just saying that when you expand (1 + sqrt(2))^n, it can be written as the sum of two square roots of consecutive integers p and p - 1. \n\nSo the task is to find such a p for each n. Let me think about small values of n to see a pattern.\n\nLet's try n = 1: (1 + sqrt(2))^1 = 1 + sqrt(2). So we need to write this as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1). Let's see: Let’s set sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1) = 1 + sqrt(2). Let me square both sides to see if I can find p. (sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1))^2 = p + (p - 1) + 2 sqrt(p(p - 1)) = 2p - 1 + 2 sqrt(p(p - 1)). This should equal (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 1 + 2 sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Therefore, setting 2p - 1 = 3 and 2 sqrt(p(p - 1)) = 2 sqrt(2). From the first equation: 2p - 1 = 3 => 2p = 4 => p = 2. Then check the second equation: sqrt(2*(2 - 1)) = sqrt(2*1) = sqrt(2), so 2 sqrt(p(p - 1)) = 2 sqrt(2), which matches. So for n=1, p=2 works.\n\nn=2: (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 1 + 2 sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). We need to express this as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1). Let's square sqrt(p) + sqrt(p - 1) again: 2p - 1 + 2 sqrt(p(p - 1)). Set this equal to 3 + 2 sqrt(2). So 2p -1 =3 => p=2 again. But then sqrt(p(p -1))=sqrt(2*1)=sqrt(2), so 2 sqrt(2) which matches. Wait, but (1 + sqrt(2))^2 is 3 + 2 sqrt(2), which is sqrt(2) + sqrt(1) + something? Wait no, when p=2, sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) is sqrt(2) + 1, which squared is 3 + 2 sqrt(2), which matches the expansion. Wait, but (1 + sqrt(2))^2 is indeed 3 + 2 sqrt(2), which is equal to sqrt(2) + 1, but squared. Wait, but the original problem says (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). For n=2, (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). But sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) would be sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1), so if we take p=3 + 2 sqrt(2), but p must be an integer. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, when n=2, (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Let me try to express this as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Let me assume that sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). If I square both sides, I get 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p-1)) = (3)^2 + (2 sqrt(2))^2 + 2*3*2 sqrt(2) = 9 + 8 + 12 sqrt(2) = 17 + 12 sqrt(2). Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, actually, when we square sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1), we get p + (p -1) + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)) = 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)). So setting this equal to (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^2? Wait no, wait, the original expression for n=2 is (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). But the problem states that (1 + sqrt(2))^n should equal sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). So for n=2, it's 3 + 2 sqrt(2) = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Let me see if such a p exists. Let me call the expression sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) = a + b sqrt(2), where a and b are integers. Wait, but 3 + 2 sqrt(2) is of that form. Let's set sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). If I can find p such that this holds. Let's square both sides: 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)) = 9 + 8 + 12 sqrt(2) = 17 + 12 sqrt(2). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the square of 3 + 2 sqrt(2) is 9 + 12 sqrt(2) + 8 = 17 + 12 sqrt(2). So 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)) = 17 + 12 sqrt(2). Therefore, equate the rational and irrational parts:\n\n2p -1 =17 → 2p=18 → p=9\n\nAnd 2 sqrt(p(p -1)) =12 sqrt(2) → sqrt(p(p -1)) =6 sqrt(2) → p(p -1) = 36*2=72. But p=9, so 9*8=72. Yes, that works. So for n=2, p=9. Therefore, (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = sqrt(9) + sqrt(8) = 3 + 2 sqrt(2). Wait, but sqrt(8) is 2 sqrt(2), so that's correct. So indeed, 3 + 2 sqrt(2) = 3 + sqrt(8), so that's sqrt(9) + sqrt(8). Hence, p=9 for n=2.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (1 + sqrt(2))^3. Let's compute that. (1 + sqrt(2))^3 = (1 + sqrt(2))*(3 + 2 sqrt(2)) = 3*(1) + 3*sqrt(2) + 2 sqrt(2)*1 + 2 sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 3 + 3 sqrt(2) + 2 sqrt(2) + 4 = 7 + 5 sqrt(2). Let's see if this can be written as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Let's set sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) =7 +5 sqrt(2). Square both sides: 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p-1)) = 49 + 50 sqrt(2) + 50 (since (7 +5 sqrt(2))^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*5 sqrt(2) + (5 sqrt(2))^2 =49 +70 sqrt(2) +25*2=49 +70 sqrt(2)+50=99 +70 sqrt(2)). So, 2p -1 =99 → 2p=100 → p=50. Then, 2 sqrt(p(p-1))=70 sqrt(2). So sqrt(50*49)=sqrt(2450)=sqrt(49*50)=7*sqrt(50)=7*5*sqrt(2)=35 sqrt(2). Then 2*35 sqrt(2)=70 sqrt(2), which matches. Therefore, p=50. So for n=3, p=50. So it works.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each n, there is such a p, and perhaps we can find a recurrence relation.\n\nThe user mentioned using induction didn't work, so maybe another approach. Let's think about the binomial expansion. (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) (sqrt(2))^k. Similarly, (1 - sqrt(2))^n would be sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) (-sqrt(2))^k. Let’s denote a_n = (1 + sqrt(2))^n and b_n = (1 - sqrt(2))^n. Note that since |1 - sqrt(2)| <1, b_n approaches 0 as n increases.\n\nBut how does this help? Well, perhaps consider that a_n + b_n is an integer, since the irrational parts cancel out. Similarly, a_n - b_n would be 2 times the sum of the terms with sqrt(2). For example, for n=1: a_1 + b_1 = (1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - sqrt(2))=2. a_1 - b_1=2 sqrt(2). For n=2: a_2 + b_2 = (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) + (3 - 2 sqrt(2))=6. a_2 - b_2=4 sqrt(2). For n=3: a_3 + b_3=7 +5 sqrt(2) +7 -5 sqrt(2)=14. a_3 - b_3=10 sqrt(2). So in general, a_n + b_n is an integer, say c_n, and (a_n - b_n)/sqrt(2) is also an integer, say d_n. Then, a_n = (c_n + d_n sqrt(2))/2. Wait, no, let's check:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 =1 + sqrt(2). Then c_1=2, d_1=2. Then (c_1 + d_1 sqrt(2))/2 = (2 + 2 sqrt(2))/2 =1 + sqrt(2), which is correct. Similarly, n=2: c_2=6, d_2=4, (6 +4 sqrt(2))/2=3 +2 sqrt(2)=a_2. So in general, a_n = (c_n + d_n sqrt(2))/2 where c_n and d_n are integers. Then, if we can express a_n as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1), perhaps we can relate c_n and d_n to p.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1), then squaring both sides gives a_n^2 = 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)). But a_n^2 = (1 + sqrt(2))^{2n} = (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^n. Wait, but this seems like it's getting more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1))^2 = 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)). So if we set this equal to (1 + sqrt(2))^{2n} = (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^n. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find a recursive relation for p_n. Let's see, for n=1, p=2; n=2, p=9; n=3, p=50. Let's see the pattern: 2, 9, 50. Let's check if there's a recurrence. From 2 to 9: 9 = 2*2 +5? Not sure. 9 = 2*5 -1? 2*5=10-1=9. Then 50=9*5 +5? 9*5=45 +5=50. Hmm, perhaps the recurrence is p_{n} = 2*p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}? Let's check: For n=2, p=9. If n=1 is 2 and n=0? Let's see, n=0: (1 + sqrt(2))^0=1. So sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1)=1. Let's solve sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1)=1. Square both sides: 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1))=1. So 2p -1=1 → p=1. Then 2 sqrt(p(p -1))=0, which works since p=1, so sqrt(1*0)=0. So p=1 for n=0. Then maybe the sequence is p0=1, p1=2, p2=9, p3=50. Let's check if 9 = 2*2 +1*1? 2*2=4 +1=5 ≠9. Or p2=2*p1 + p0=2*2 +1=5, but p2=9. Not matching. Alternatively, p2= 6*p1 - p0? 6*2 -1=11 ≠9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at p1=2, p2=9, p3=50. Let's see the ratio: 9/2=4.5, 50/9≈5.555. Not obvious. Alternatively, check if pn= ( (1 + sqrt(2))^{n} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{n} )^2? For n=1: (1 + sqrt(2) +1 - sqrt(2))/2 squared? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps pn satisfies a recurrence relation based on the powers of (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, since (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (1 + sqrt(2))*(1 + sqrt(2))^n. Suppose we have (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1))*(1 + sqrt(2)). Let's expand this:\n\nsqrt(p_n)*(1) + sqrt(p_n)*sqrt(2) + sqrt(p_n -1)*1 + sqrt(p_n -1)*sqrt(2).\n\n= [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)]\n\nBut we need this to be sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1). Let's denote this as S_{n+1} = sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1).\n\nSo S_{n+1} = S_n + sqrt(2) S_n = S_n (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, but that's just (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (1 + sqrt(2))^{n}*(1 + sqrt(2)), which is obvious. But we need to express S_{n+1} = (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1). So perhaps there is a recurrence relation for p_n based on p_{n} and p_{n-1} or similar.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the expression from induction. Suppose that for some n, (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1))(1 + sqrt(2)) = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n) sqrt(2) + sqrt(p_n -1) + sqrt(p_n -1) sqrt(2). Let's group terms:\n\n= [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)]\n\n= S_n + sqrt(2) S_n = S_n (1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nBut we need to express this as sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1). Let's square both sides of S_{n+1} = S_n (1 + sqrt(2)):\n\nS_{n+1}^2 = S_n^2 (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = (2 p_n -1 + 2 sqrt(p_n (p_n -1))) * (3 + 2 sqrt(2)).\n\nThis seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation between p_{n+1} and p_n by expressing the product.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that S_{n+1} = S_n (1 + sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1))(1 + sqrt(2)). Let's expand this:\n\nsqrt(p_n) *1 + sqrt(p_n)*sqrt(2) + sqrt(p_n -1)*1 + sqrt(p_n -1)*sqrt(2).\n\n= [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)].\n\nBut we can also write this as sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1). Let's equate the two expressions:\n\nsqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1) = [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)].\n\nThis seems a bit abstract. Maybe if we assume that p_{n+1} can be expressed in terms of p_n and some other term. Alternatively, perhaps there is a pattern in the p_n values. For n=1, p=2; n=2, p=9; n=3, p=50. Let's see if these numbers follow a particular sequence. 2,9,50,...\n\nLooking up the sequence 2,9,50 in the OEIS (if I were to check), but since I can't access external resources, let's think recursively. Let's see:\n\nFrom n=1 to n=2: 2 to 9. How? 2*4 +1=9? Not sure. From 9 to 50: 9*5 +5=50. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe each term is 6 times the previous term minus the one before that. Let's test:\n\np2=9, if p1=2 and p0=1. Then 6*p1 - p0 =6*2 -1=12-1=11≠9. No. Alternatively, 5*p1 - p0=10-1=9. Yes! 5*2 -1=9. Then p3=5*p2 -p1=5*9 -2=45-2=43≠50. No. Doesn't work. Next idea: p3=5*p2 + something. 5*9=45, 45+5=50. Maybe 5*p2 +5=50. But why +5?\n\nAlternatively, look at the values:\n\nn | p_n\n\n0 | 1\n\n1 | 2\n\n2 |9\n\n3 |50\n\nLet's see the recursion. Let's check if p_{n} = 2*p_{n-1} + 2*p_{n-2}. For n=2: 2*2 +2*1=4+2=6≠9. No. Or p_{n}= 3*p_{n-1} + something. For n=2: 3*2=6, 6 +3=9. For n=3:3*9=27, 27 +23=50. Doesn't make sense. Alternatively, p_{n}= 2*p_{n-1} + 5*p_{n-2}. For n=2: 2*2 +5*1=4+5=9. For n=3: 2*9 +5*2=18+10=28≠50. No.\n\nAlternatively, p_{n}= 6*p_{n-1} -p_{n-2}. For n=2: 6*2 -1=12-1=11≠9. No. For n=3:6*9 -2=54-2=52≠50. Close but no.\n\nWait, p1=2, p2=9, p3=50. The ratio between p2 and p1 is 4.5, between p3 and p2 is ~5.555. Maybe the recurrence is nonlinear. Alternatively, maybe the p_n's are related to the coefficients in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, consider that (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then, (1 + sqrt(2))^{n} = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Let's square both sides:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^{2n} = (sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1))^2 = 2 p_n -1 + 2 sqrt(p_n(p_n -1)).\n\nBut (1 + sqrt(2))^{2n} is also equal to (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^n. Let's denote this as A_n + B_n sqrt(2), where A_n and B_n are integers. Then, we have:\n\nA_n + B_n sqrt(2) = 2 p_n -1 + 2 sqrt(p_n(p_n -1)).\n\nTherefore, equate the rational and irrational parts:\n\nA_n = 2 p_n -1,\n\nB_n = 2 sqrt(p_n(p_n -1))/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) sqrt(p_n(p_n -1)).\n\nWait, because the left side has B_n sqrt(2), and the right side has 2 sqrt(p_n(p_n -1)) which is equal to sqrt(4 p_n(p_n -1)). So equate:\n\nsqrt(4 p_n(p_n -1)) = B_n sqrt(2),\n\nso 4 p_n(p_n -1) = B_n^2 *2,\n\nwhich simplifies to 2 p_n(p_n -1) = B_n^2.\n\nAlso, from the first equation: A_n =2 p_n -1.\n\nBut A_n and B_n come from expanding (3 + 2 sqrt(2))^n. Let's see for n=1: (3 +2 sqrt(2))^1=3 +2 sqrt(2), so A_1=3, B_1=2. Then, from A_n=2 p_n -1: 3=2p_1 -1 → p1=2, which matches. From 2 p1(p1 -1)=2*2*1=4= B1^2=4, which works.\n\nn=2: (3 +2 sqrt(2))^2=9 +12 sqrt(2) +8=17 +12 sqrt(2). So A2=17, B2=12. Then 2 p2 -1=17 → p2=9. Then 2*9*8=144=12^2, which works.\n\nn=3: (3 +2 sqrt(2))^3= (3 +2 sqrt(2))(17 +12 sqrt(2))= 51 + 36 sqrt(2) +34 sqrt(2) +48=99 +70 sqrt(2). So A3=99, B3=70. Then 2 p3 -1=99 → p3=50. Then 2*50*49=4900=70^2, which works. So this seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for each n, if we let A_n + B_n sqrt(2) = (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n, then p_n = (A_n +1)/2. And we need to show that such a p_n is an integer, and that 2 p_n(p_n -1)=B_n^2.\n\nBut since A_n and B_n satisfy the recurrence relations derived from the expansion of (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n, we can perhaps find a recurrence for p_n.\n\nAlternatively, notice that (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n = A_n + B_n sqrt(2). Similarly, (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n = A_n - B_n sqrt(2). Therefore, A_n = [(3 +2 sqrt(2))^n + (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n]/2, and B_n = [(3 +2 sqrt(2))^n - (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n]/(2 sqrt(2)).\n\nThen, since p_n = (A_n +1)/2, we can write p_n = [ (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n + (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n +2 ]/4.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps use induction after all, even though the user said it wasn't fruitful. Let's try.\n\nBase case n=1: p=2 works.\n\nAssume that for some n ≥1, (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then, for n+1:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (1 + sqrt(2))*(sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)).\n\n= sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n) sqrt(2) + sqrt(p_n -1) + sqrt(p_n -1) sqrt(2).\n\nGroup terms:\n\n= [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)].\n\nBut this is equal to (1 + sqrt(2))*(sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)), which we need to express as sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1). To find p_{n+1}, we can square both sides:\n\nLeft side: (1 + sqrt(2))^{2(n+1)} = (3 +2 sqrt(2))^{n+1} = A_{n+1} + B_{n+1} sqrt(2)).\n\nRight side: (sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1))^2 = 2 p_{n+1} -1 + 2 sqrt(p_{n+1}(p_{n+1} -1)).\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\nA_{n+1} =2 p_{n+1} -1,\n\nB_{n+1} =2 sqrt(p_{n+1}(p_{n+1} -1))/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) sqrt(p_{n+1}(p_{n+1} -1)).\n\nBut from the recurrence relations of A_n and B_n, since (3 +2 sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (3 +2 sqrt(2))*(A_n + B_n sqrt(2)) =3 A_n + 3 B_n sqrt(2) +2 sqrt(2) A_n +2*2 B_n.\n\n= (3 A_n +4 B_n) + (3 B_n +2 A_n) sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, A_{n+1}=3 A_n +4 B_n,\n\nB_{n+1}=3 B_n +2 A_n.\n\nNow, we need to show that p_{n+1}= (A_{n+1} +1)/2 is an integer and satisfies 2 p_{n+1}(p_{n+1} -1)=B_{n+1}^2.\n\nAssuming by induction that for n, A_n=2 p_n -1 and B_n= sqrt(2 p_n(p_n -1)), let's substitute into the recurrence:\n\nA_{n+1}=3*(2 p_n -1) +4*sqrt(2 p_n(p_n -1)).\n\nBut this seems messy. Alternatively, since we know that A_n and B_n satisfy A_{n+1}=3 A_n +4 B_n and B_{n+1}=2 A_n +3 B_n (from multiplying out (3 +2 sqrt(2))*(A_n + B_n sqrt(2))), we can use these to find a recurrence for p_n.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's recall that p_{n} = (A_n +1)/2. From A_{n+1}=3 A_n +4 B_n and B_{n}= sqrt(2 p_n(p_n -1)), we can try to express everything in terms of p_n.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct formula for p_n. For example, noticing that p_n follows the recurrence p_{n+1}=6 p_n -p_{n-1}. Let's test this:\n\nFor n=1, p1=2, p2=9. If p3=6*9 -2=54-2=52≠50. Doesn't work. For n=2, p2=9, p3=50. If p4=6*50 -9=300-9=291. Let's compute p4 manually. For n=4, (1 + sqrt(2))^4. Let's compute it: (1 + sqrt(2))^4 = (7 +5 sqrt(2))*(1 + sqrt(2))=7 +7 sqrt(2) +5 sqrt(2) +5*2=7 +12 sqrt(2) +10=17 +12 sqrt(2). Wait, but (1 + sqrt(2))^4 should be ((1 + sqrt(2))^2)^2=(3 +2 sqrt(2))^2=9 +12 sqrt(2)+8=17 +12 sqrt(2). So to write this as sqrt(p4) + sqrt(p4 -1). Let's set sqrt(p4) + sqrt(p4 -1)=17 +12 sqrt(2). Square both sides: 2 p4 -1 +2 sqrt(p4(p4 -1))= (17)^2 + (12 sqrt(2))^2 +2*17*12 sqrt(2)=289 +288 +408 sqrt(2)=577 +408 sqrt(2). Therefore, equate:\n\n2 p4 -1=577 → p4=578/2=289.\n\nAnd 2 sqrt(p4(p4 -1))=408 sqrt(2) → sqrt(289*288)=sqrt(289*288)=sqrt(289)*sqrt(288)=17*sqrt(288)=17*sqrt(144*2)=17*12 sqrt(2)=204 sqrt(2). Then 2*204 sqrt(2)=408 sqrt(2), which matches. So p4=289. Now, if the recurrence were p4=6 p3 -p2=6*50 -9=300-9=291≠289. So that doesn't fit. Hence, the recurrence is not linear of order 2 with coefficients 6 and -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n is an integer, as we saw earlier. Let's denote this as c_n. Then, (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then, (1 - sqrt(2))^n would be sqrt(p_n) - sqrt(p_n -1), since (sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1))*(sqrt(p_n) - sqrt(p_n -1))=p_n -(p_n -1)=1. Therefore, (1 - sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p_n) - sqrt(p_n -1). Hence, c_n = (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n = 2 sqrt(p_n). Therefore, sqrt(p_n) = c_n /2. Hence, p_n = (c_n /2)^2. But c_n must be even for this to be an integer. Let's check with n=1: c_1=2, so p1=(2/2)^2=1. Wait, but earlier we had p1=2. This contradicts. Hmm, this suggests a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, for n=1: (1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - sqrt(2))=2, which is c_1=2. Then sqrt(p1) + sqrt(p1 -1) + sqrt(p1) - sqrt(p1 -1) =2 sqrt(p1)=c1=2. Therefore, sqrt(p1)=1, so p1=1. But earlier we saw that for n=1, p=2. This inconsistency indicates an error in the assumption that (1 - sqrt(2))^n=sqrt(p_n) - sqrt(p_n -1). Let's check for n=1: (1 - sqrt(2))^1=1 - sqrt(2). If p1=2, then sqrt(2) - sqrt(1)=sqrt(2)-1, which is not equal to 1 - sqrt(2). Hence, the assumption that (1 - sqrt(2))^n=sqrt(p_n) - sqrt(p_n -1) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, this approach is flawed. Let's discard it.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's use the fact that (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n is an integer, and (1 + sqrt(2))^n - (1 - sqrt(2))^n is a multiple of sqrt(2). Let's denote these as c_n and d_n sqrt(2), respectively. Then:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^n = (c_n + d_n sqrt(2))/2,\n\n(1 - sqrt(2))^n = (c_n - d_n sqrt(2))/2.\n\nWe need to express (1 + sqrt(2))^n as sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Let's set:\n\n(c_n + d_n sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1).\n\nLet's square both sides:\n\n(c_n^2 + 2 c_n d_n sqrt(2) + 2 d_n^2)/4 = p + (p -1) + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)).\n\nSimplify left side: (c_n^2 + 2 d_n^2)/4 + (c_n d_n sqrt(2))/2.\n\nRight side: 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)).\n\nEquate rational and irrational parts:\n\nRational: (c_n^2 + 2 d_n^2)/4 =2p -1,\n\nIrrational: (c_n d_n sqrt(2))/2 =2 sqrt(p(p -1)).\n\nFrom the irrational part:\n\n(c_n d_n sqrt(2))/2 =2 sqrt(p(p -1)),\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/sqrt(2)):\n\nc_n d_n =2*2 sqrt(p(p -1)/2),\n\nWait, let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\nLeft side: (c_n d_n sqrt(2)/2)^2 = (c_n^2 d_n^2 *2)/4 = (c_n^2 d_n^2)/2,\n\nRight side: (2 sqrt(p(p -1)))^2=4 p(p -1).\n\nTherefore:\n\n(c_n^2 d_n^2)/2 =4 p(p -1),\n\n=> c_n^2 d_n^2 =8 p(p -1).\n\nFrom the rational part:\n\n(c_n^2 + 2 d_n^2)/4 =2p -1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\nc_n^2 +2 d_n^2=8p -4.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. c_n^2 +2 d_n^2=8p -4,\n\n2. c_n^2 d_n^2=8 p(p -1).\n\nThis system of equations can be solved for p. Let's denote x= c_n^2, y= d_n^2. Then:\n\nx +2y=8p -4,\n\nx y=8 p(p -1).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe express p from the first equation: 8p =x +2y +4 → p=(x +2y +4)/8.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\nx y=8*( (x +2y +4)/8 )*( (x +2y +4)/8 -1 )\n\n= (x +2y +4)*( (x +2y +4 -8)/8 )\n\n= (x +2y +4)*(x +2y -4)/8.\n\nThus:\n\nx y = (x +2y +4)(x +2y -4)/8.\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n8x y = (x +2y)^2 -16.\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(x +2y)^2 -16 =x^2 +4x y +4y^2 -16.\n\nThus:\n\n8x y =x^2 +4x y +4y^2 -16,\n\n=> 0 =x^2 -4x y +4y^2 -16,\n\n=> x^2 -4x y +4y^2=16,\n\n=> (x -2y)^2=16,\n\n=> x -2y=±4.\n\nBut x and y are squares of integers (since c_n and d_n are integers), so x and y are non-negative. Also, for n≥1, c_n and d_n are positive. Let's assume x -2y=4, since the other case x -2y=-4 may not hold. Let's check for n=1:\n\nc1=2, d1=2. x=4, y=4. x -2y=4 -8=-4. So x -2y=-4. Therefore, we have x -2y=-4.\n\nThen, x=2y -4.\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\nx +2y=8p -4 → (2y -4) +2y=8p -4 →4y -4=8p -4 →4y=8p →y=2p.\n\nBut y=d_n^2=2p,\n\nBut also from x=2y -4=2*(2p) -4=4p -4.\n\nBut x=c_n^2=4p -4.\n\nTherefore, c_n^2=4p -4,\n\nBut c_n^2 +2 d_n^2=8p -4,\n\nSubstitute x=4p -4 and y=2p:\n\n(4p -4) +2*(2p)=8p -4,\n\n4p -4 +4p=8p -4,\n\n8p -4=8p -4. True.\n\nAlso, from x y=8 p(p -1),\n\nx=4p -4, y=2p,\n\nSo (4p -4)(2p)=8p(p -1),\n\n8p(p -1)=8p(p -1). True.\n\nTherefore, the system holds when x -2y=-4. Thus, for each n, we have:\n\nc_n^2=4p_n -4,\n\nd_n^2=2p_n.\n\nBut d_n^2=2p_n implies p_n= d_n^2 /2.\n\nBut d_n must be even for p_n to be integer. Let's check for n=1: d1=2 → p1=4/2=2. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: d2=12 → p2=144/2=72. Wait, no! Earlier for n=2, p=9. Contradiction. So something's wrong.\n\nWait, d_n is the coefficient from earlier. For n=2, (1 + sqrt(2))^2=3 +2 sqrt(2). Then c2=3 +3 - something? Wait, no. Wait, c_n = (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n. For n=2: (3 +2 sqrt(2)) + (3 -2 sqrt(2))=6. So c2=6. d_n sqrt(2) = (1 + sqrt(2))^n - (1 - sqrt(2))^n. For n=2: (3 +2 sqrt(2)) - (3 -2 sqrt(2))=4 sqrt(2). So d_n sqrt(2)=4 sqrt(2) → d2=4. Therefore, d2=4. Then p2=4^2 /2=16/2=8, but earlier p2=9. Contradiction. Hence, this approach has a mistake.\n\nThis indicates that the assumption p_n= d_n^2 /2 is incorrect. Therefore, the earlier deduction must have an error. Let's retrace.\n\nWe had:\n\nFrom the irrational part, after squaring:\n\nc_n^2 d_n^2=8 p(p -1).\n\nFrom the rational part:\n\nc_n^2 +2 d_n^2=8p -4.\n\nWe also found that x -2y=-4, leading to c_n^2=4p -4 and d_n^2=2p.\n\nBut for n=2:\n\nc2=6 → c2^2=36=4p -4 →4p=40 →p=10. But earlier p2=9. Contradiction. Hence, this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, this approach has a flaw. Let's reconsider.\n\nThe mistake must be in assuming x -2y=-4 leads to c_n^2=4p -4 and d_n^2=2p. Let's check for n=2:\n\nFrom c_n=6, d_n=4.\n\nThen x=36, y=16.\n\nFrom equation 1: x +2y=36+32=68=8p -4 →8p=72→p=9. Which matches.\n\nFrom equation 2: x y=36*16=576=8p(p -1)=8*9*8=576. Correct.\n\nBut according to x -2y=36-32=4. So x -2y=4, not -4. Hence, the earlier assumption was wrong. For n=2, x -2y=4. But for n=1, x=4, y=4, x-2y=4-8=-4. So the sign alternates? Not sure. This complicates things.\n\nTherefore, the relationship x -2y=±4, depending on n. This makes it difficult to find a general formula. Hence, this approach might not be the best way to proceed.\n\nAlternative idea: Use the initial examples to find a pattern and then generalize. For n=1, p=2; n=2, p=9; n=3, p=50; n=4, p=289. Let's see:\n\n2,9,50,289,...\n\nThese numbers look familiar. They seem to follow the pattern where each term is 6 times the previous term minus the term before that. Let's check:\n\nFor p2=9: 6*2 -1=12-1=11≠9.\n\nBut 5*2 -1=9. For p3=50:5*9 -2=45-2=43≠50. No.\n\nWait, p3=50. 6*9=54 -4=50. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that 2=1*2, 9=3*3, 50=5*10, 289=17*17. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, look at the prime factors:\n\n2=2,\n\n9=3^2,\n\n50=2*5^2,\n\n289=17^2.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, note that (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1). Then, perhaps p= ( (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n )^2 /4 +1/2? Let's try for n=1:\n\n( (1 + sqrt(2)) + (1 - sqrt(2)) )^2 /4 +1/2= (2)^2/4 +1/2=1 +0.5=1.5. Not 2.\n\nNo. Alternatively, maybe p= [ (1 + sqrt(2))^{2n} + (1 - sqrt(2))^{2n} ]/2. For n=1: (3 +2 sqrt(2))^1 + (3 -2 sqrt(2))^1=6, divided by 2=3. Not 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1). Let's denote this as:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1).\n\nLet's consider the conjugate: (1 - sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1), because multiplying the two gives 1: (sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1))(sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1))=p -(p-1)=1. Which matches (1 + sqrt(2))^n*(1 - sqrt(2))^n=(1 -2)^n=(-1)^n. So unless n is even, this product is -1. But according to our earlier examples, for n=1, (1 + sqrt(2))*(1 - sqrt(2))=-1, and (sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1))(sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1))=1. Contradiction unless n is even. This suggests that the assumption (1 + sqrt(2))^n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1) only holds for even n. But in our examples, n=1,2,3,4 worked. Wait, but when n is odd, (1 + sqrt(2))^n*(1 - sqrt(2))^n= (-1)^n. For example, n=1: -1, n=2:1, n=3:-1, etc. However, (sqrt(p) + sqrt(p-1))(sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1))=1. Therefore, this is only possible if (-1)^n=1, i.e., n even. But the examples include odd n and even n. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the assumption that the conjugate is sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1). \n\nIndeed, for n=1: (1 + sqrt(2))*(1 - sqrt(2))=-1, but (sqrt(2) +1)*(sqrt(2) -1)=2 -1=1. Therefore, the product is 1, not -1. Therefore, this approach is incorrect. Hence, the earlier assumption is wrong, which means that (1 - sqrt(2))^n is not equal to sqrt(p) - sqrt(p-1), but rather something else. Therefore, the earlier approach is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the initial method of induction is not straightforward. Maybe the user tried induction on n, assuming it holds for n and proving for n+1, but couldn't find a relationship between p_n and p_{n+1}.\n\nAlternative approach: Express (1 + sqrt(2))^n in the form a_n + b_n sqrt(2), where a_n and b_n are integers. Then, we need to find p such that a_n + b_n sqrt(2)=sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Let's equate this:\n\na_n = sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1),\n\nb_n sqrt(2) = ... Wait, no. Wait, the expression a_n + b_n sqrt(2) must equal sqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1). Therefore, equate the coefficients:\n\nsqrt(p) + sqrt(p -1) = a_n + b_n sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nsqrt(p) = a_n - sqrt(p -1) + b_n sqrt(2).\n\nThis seems unhelpful. Instead, square both sides:\n\n(p) + (p -1) + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)) = a_n^2 + 2 a_n b_n sqrt(2) + 2 b_n^2.\n\nSimplify left side: 2p -1 + 2 sqrt(p(p -1)).\n\nRight side: (a_n^2 + 2 b_n^2) + 2 a_n b_n sqrt(2).\n\nEquate rational and irrational parts:\n\nRational: 2p -1 =a_n^2 +2 b_n^2,\n\nIrrational: 2 sqrt(p(p -1))=2 a_n b_n sqrt(2).\n\nSimplify the irrational equation:\n\nsqrt(p(p -1))=a_n b_n sqrt(2).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np(p -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. 2p -1 =a_n^2 +2 b_n^2,\n\n2. p(p -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nThis system seems complicated, but maybe we can solve for p. Let's denote S = a_n^2, T = b_n^2. Then:\n\nFrom equation 1: 2p -1 =S +2 T,\n\nFrom equation 2: p(p -1)=2 S T.\n\nWe have two equations with variables p, S, T. But without additional information, this is underdetermined. However, since a_n and b_n satisfy the recurrence relations from the expansion, we can express S and T in terms of previous terms.\n\nAlternatively, note that a_{n+1}=a_n +2 b_n,\n\nb_{n+1}=a_n +b_n.\n\nThis comes from (a_n + b_n sqrt(2))(1 + sqrt(2)) =a_n +a_n sqrt(2) +b_n sqrt(2) +2 b_n= (a_n +2 b_n) + (a_n +b_n) sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relations are:\n\na_{n+1}=a_n +2 b_n,\n\nb_{n+1}=a_n +b_n.\n\nWith initial terms a_1=1, b_1=1 (since (1 + sqrt(2))^1=1 +1 sqrt(2)).\n\nLet's verify:\n\nn=1: a1=1, b1=1,\n\nn=2: a2=1 +2*1=3, b2=1 +1=2. Which matches (1 + sqrt(2))^2=3 +2 sqrt(2).\n\nn=3: a3=3 +2*2=7, b3=3 +2=5. Which matches (1 + sqrt(2))^3=7 +5 sqrt(2).\n\nn=4: a4=7 +2*5=17, b4=7 +5=12. Which matches (1 + sqrt(2))^4=17 +12 sqrt(2).\n\nThis is correct.\n\nNow, using these recurrence relations, we can try to find a relationship between p_n and p_{n+1}.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nFor each n, we have:\n\n2p_n -1 =a_n^2 +2 b_n^2,\n\np_n(p_n -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nLet's try to express p_{n+1} in terms of a_n and b_n.\n\nUsing the recurrence relations:\n\na_{n+1}=a_n +2 b_n,\n\nb_{n+1}=a_n +b_n.\n\nThen, for p_{n+1}:\n\n2p_{n+1} -1 =a_{n+1}^2 +2 b_{n+1}^2.\n\nSubstitute a_{n+1} and b_{n+1}:\n\n= (a_n +2 b_n)^2 +2(a_n +b_n)^2.\n\nExpand:\n\n= a_n^2 +4 a_n b_n +4 b_n^2 +2(a_n^2 +2 a_n b_n +b_n^2)\n\n= a_n^2 +4 a_n b_n +4 b_n^2 +2a_n^2 +4 a_n b_n +2 b_n^2\n\n=3a_n^2 +8 a_n b_n +6 b_n^2.\n\nBut also, from the equation for p_n:\n\n2p_n -1 =a_n^2 +2 b_n^2.\n\nLet’s denote this as equation (1).\n\nWe need to relate 3a_n^2 +8 a_n b_n +6 b_n^2 to p_n.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, notice that from equation (2):\n\np_n(p_n -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nWe might need to find a way to express the combination of a_n and b_n in terms of p_n.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that there exists a recurrence relation for p_n. Given the values p1=2, p2=9, p3=50, p4=289, let's see if there's a pattern in the ratios or differences:\n\np1=2,\n\np2=9 (diff +7),\n\np3=50 (diff +41),\n\np4=289 (diff +239).\n\nThe differences are 7,41,239. These numbers seem to follow a pattern: 7=2*3 +1, 41=7*5 +6, but not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the ratios: 9/2=4.5, 50/9≈5.555, 289/50≈5.78, 1682/289≈5.82 (assuming next term is 1682, which is 289*6 -something). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that 2,9,50,289 are related to the denominators of the convergents of sqrt(2). The convergents of sqrt(2) are 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, etc. The denominators are 1,2,5,12,29,70, etc., which are the Pell numbers. The Pell numbers follow the recurrence P_n=2 P_{n-1} + P_{n-2}. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the p_n values seem to be squares of the numerators or denominators of the convergents. For example, 17^2=289=p4. The numerator for the 4th convergent is 17. Similarly, 7^2=49 is close to p3=50. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, consider that (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n = c_n, which we saw earlier. For n=1:2, n=2:6, n=3:14, n=4:34, n=5:82, etc. These numbers are twice the Pell-Lucas numbers. The Pell-Lucas numbers start as 2, 6, 14, 34, 82, etc., and satisfy Q_n=2 Q_{n-1} + Q_{n-2}.\n\nBut p_n for n=1 is2, which is Q_1/1. For n=2, p=9=Q_2=6, no. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, notice that p_n= (Q_n/2)^2 +1. For n=1: Q1=2, (2/2)^2 +1=1 +1=2. For n=2: Q2=6, (6/2)^2 +1=9 +1=10≠9. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps p_n is related to the Pell numbers. Pell numbers: 0,1,2,5,12,29,70,169,408, etc. For n=1, p=2=Pell(3). For n=2, p=9=3^2. For n=3, p=50=5*10. For n=4, p=289=17^2. Not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, notice that p_n= a_n^2 + b_n^2. For n=1: a1=1, b1=1 →1+1=2. For n=2: a2=3, b2=2 →9+4=13≠9. No.\n\nAlternatively, p_n= (a_n +b_n)^2. For n=1: (1+1)^2=4≠2. No.\n\nAlternatively, p_n= (a_n)^2. For n=1:1, no. For n=2:9=3^2. For n=3:7^2=49≠50. Close. For n=4:17^2=289= p4. So mixed results.\n\nThis suggests that there might not be a simple formula, but rather a recursive relation that can be proven by induction using the recurrence relations of a_n and b_n.\n\nLet’s attempt induction again. Assume that for all k ≤n, (1 + sqrt(2))^k = sqrt(p_k) + sqrt(p_k -1). We need to show that (1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} can be expressed as sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1}.\n\nFrom the recurrence relations:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^{n+1} = (1 + sqrt(2))*(sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)).\n\n= sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n) sqrt(2) + sqrt(p_n -1) + sqrt(p_n -1) sqrt(2).\n\n= [sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)] + sqrt(2)[sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)].\n\n= (1 + sqrt(2))*(sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1)).\n\nBut this just restates the original expression. To proceed, we need to find a way to express this as sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1).\n\nLet’s denote S = sqrt(p_n) + sqrt(p_n -1). Then, (1 + sqrt(2))S = sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1}.\n\nTo find p_{n+1}, we can square both sides:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))^2 S^2 = (sqrt(p_{n+1}) + sqrt(p_{n+1} -1))^2.\n\nLeft side: (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) S^2 = (3 + 2 sqrt(2)) (2 p_n -1 + 2 sqrt(p_n (p_n -1)))).\n\nRight side: 2 p_{n+1} -1 + 2 sqrt(p_{n+1} (p_{n+1} -1))).\n\nThis seems very complicated. However, we know from earlier examples that p_{n+1} can be expressed in terms of p_n and other terms. For instance, from n=1 to n=2: p1=2 to p2=9. Let's see if we can find a pattern.\n\nNotice that:\n\np2=9= (2*2) + (1*5) → but not clear.\n\nAlternatively, p2=9=2^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 * something. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, observe that in the examples:\n\np1=2,\n\np2=9=2*2 +5,\n\np3=50=9*5 +5,\n\np4=289=50*5 +39.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, consider the relation between p_n and the earlier terms a_n and b_n.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\n2p_n -1 =a_n^2 +2 b_n^2,\n\np_n(p_n -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nLet’s express p_n(p_n -1)=2 a_n^2 b_n^2.\n\nFrom the first equation, a_n^2=2p_n -1 -2 b_n^2.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\np_n(p_n -1)=2(2p_n -1 -2 b_n^2) b_n^2.\n\n=4p_n b_n^2 -2 b_n^2 -4 b_n^4.\n\nThis leads to a quadratic in p_n:\n\np_n^2 -p_n -4p_n b_n^2 +2 b_n^2 +4 b_n^4=0.\n\nThis seems too complicated to solve for p_n.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps the best approach is to use induction with the recurrence relations of a_n and b_n, and show that p_{n+1}= something based on p_n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a direct formula for p_n. Given that p_n= (A_n +1)/2, where A_n is from (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n = A_n + B_n sqrt(2), then A_n = ( (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n + (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n )/2.\n\nThen p_n= (A_n +1)/2 = [ (3 +2 sqrt(2))^n + (3 -2 sqrt(2))^n +2 ]/4.\n\nThis might be the formula for p_n.
