    "Content": "I'm doing one of the exercises of Stewart and Tall's book on Algebraic Number Theory. The problem concerns finding an expression for the norm in the cyclotomic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(e^{2\\pi i / 5})$. The exact problem is the following: If $\\zeta = e^{2 \\pi i / 5}$, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(e^{2\\pi i / 5})$, prove that the norm of $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$ is of the form $\\frac{1}{4}(A^2 -5B^2)$ where $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. ( Hint: In calculating $\\textbf{N}(\\alpha)$, first calculate $\\sigma_1 (\\alpha) \\sigma_4 (\\alpha)$ where $\\sigma_i (\\zeta) := \\zeta^{i}$. Show that this is of the form $q + r\\theta + s\\phi$ where $q, r, s \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $\\theta = \\zeta + \\zeta^{4}$ and $\\phi = \\zeta^{2} + \\zeta^{3}$. In the same way establish $\\sigma_2 (\\alpha) \\sigma_3 (\\alpha) = q + s\\theta + r\\phi$  ) Using Exercise $3$ prove that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$ has an infinite number of units. Now, I've already done what the hint says and arrived at the following. If we let $\\alpha = a +b\\zeta^{} + c\\zeta^{2} + d\\zeta^{3} \\in \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$ then after simplifying I get $$\\textbf{N}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1 (\\alpha) \\sigma_4 (\\alpha) \\sigma_2(\\alpha) \\sigma_3(\\alpha) = ( q + r\\theta + s\\phi ) ( q + s\\theta + r\\phi )$$ $$ = q^2 + (qr + qs)(\\theta + \\phi) + rs(\\theta^2 + \\phi^2) + (r^2 + s^2)\\theta \\phi$$ and then it is not that hard to see that $\\theta + \\phi = -1$, $\\theta^2 + \\phi^2 = 3$ and $\\theta \\phi = -1$ so that in the end one obtains $$\\textbf{N}(\\alpha) = q^2 - (qr + qs) + 3rs - (r^2 + s^2)$$ where $q = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, $r = ab + bc + cd$ and $s = ac + ad + bd$. Now, here I got stuck because I just can't take the last expression for the norm into the form that the exercise wants. The purpose is to get that nice form for the norm to find units by solving the diophantine equation $\\textbf{N}(\\alpha) = \\pm 1$, which is what the Exercise $3$ mentioned in the statatement of the problem is about. I already know how to prove the existence of infinitely many units in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]$ (without using Dirichlet's Unit Theorem of course), but the exercise also demands a proof that the norm is equal to $\\frac{1}{4}(A^2 -5B^2)$. I even asked my professor about this and we were not able to get the desired form for the norm. So my question is if anybody knows how to prove that the norm has that form, and if so, how can I show that? Or if it could be that maybe the hint given in the exercise is not that helpful? Thanks a lot in advance for any help with this. EDIT After looking at Derek Jennings' answer below, to get from the expression I had for the norm to the one in Derek's answer is just a matter of taking out a common factor of $1/4$ in the expression and then completing the square, $$\\textbf{N}(\\alpha) = q^2 - (qr + qs) + 3rs - (r^2 + s^2) = q^2 - q(r+s) + rs - (r-s)^2$$ $$ = \\frac{1}{4}( 4q^2 - 4q(r+s) + 4rs - 4(r-s)^2  ) $$ $$=  \\frac{1}{4} ( 4q^2 - 4q(r+s) +\\overbrace{(r+s)^2} - \\overbrace{(r+s)^2} + 4rs - 4(r-s)^2  )$$ $$ = \\frac{1}{4} ( (2q -(r+s))^2 -(r-s)^2 - 4(r-s)^2 )$$ $$ = \\frac{1}{4}( (2q - r - s)^2 - 5(r-s)^2 ) = \\frac{1}{4}(A^2 - 5B^2),$$ as desired. Of course it is easier if you already know what to get at =)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You're almost there: set $A=2q-r-s$ and $B=r-s.$ Then your expression for $\\textbf{N}(\\alpha)$ reduces to the desired form. i.e. your $$\\textbf{N}(\\alpha) = \\frac14 \\left \\lbrace (2q-r-s)^2 - 5(r-s)^2 \\right \\rbrace\n= \\frac14(A^2-5B^2).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the main goal is to prove that the norm of an element α in ℤ[ζ] (where ζ is a 5th root of unity) has the form ¼(A² - 5B²) with A, B integers. The problem mentions several steps already taken by the user, like calculating σ₁(α)σ₄(α) and σ₂(α)σ₃(α), and simplifying the expression using θ and φ. The user arrived at an expression for the norm but couldn't convert it into the desired form until Derek Jennings' answer showed completing the square.\n\nNow, to list the assumptions: The problem states that ζ = e^(2πi/5), K = ℚ(ζ), and α is in ℤ[ζ]. The norm is being considered here, so each assumption should be a single condition on one object. The key points are:\n\n- ζ is a primitive 5th root of unity (since ζ = e^(2πi/5)).\n- K is the cyclotomic field generated by ζ.\n- α is an element of the ring ℤ[ζ], which is the ring of integers of K.\n- The norm N(α) is calculated using the product of embeddings σ₁σ₄σ₂σ₃.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user has already followed the hint and derived N(α) in terms of q, r, s. The final step required algebraic manipulation to express it as ¼(A² -5B²). However, the assumptions for the problem as posed (not the entire thought process) should be the given conditions from the problem. The problem's main assumptions are about the setup: ζ, K, α in ℤ[ζ], and the form of the norm. The original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7 or other constraints beyond α being in ℤ[ζ].\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- ζ = e^(2πi/5).\n- K is the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ).\n- α is an element of ℤ[ζ].\n- The norm N(α) is calculated as the product σ₁(α)σ₄(α)σ₂(α)σ₃(α).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is told to prove the norm is of the form ¼(A² -5B²). The problem's assumptions are the given conditions under which this must be proven. So the key assumptions are:\n\n- ζ is a primitive 5th root of unity (since K is ℚ(ζ) with ζ = e^(2πi/5)).\n- α is in ℤ[ζ].\n- The norm is defined as the product of the embeddings σ₁, σ₂, σ₃, σ₄ applied to α (since the problem mentions calculating N(α) via those σ_i).\n\nBut the problem might not require restating the definition of the norm if it's standard. However, the problem does specify that α is in ℤ[ζ], which is crucial because the coefficients A and B must be integers.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n1. ζ = e^(2πi/5), which is a primitive 5th root of unity.\n2. K = ℚ(ζ), the cyclotomic field generated by ζ.\n3. α is an element of ℤ[ζ], the ring of integers of K.\n4. The norm N(α) is calculated as σ₁(α)σ₂(α)σ₃(α)σ₄(α), where σ_i(ζ) = ζ^i.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says \"prove that the norm of α ∈ ℤ[ζ] is of the form...\", so the main assumptions are ζ being the specific root, α being in ℤ[ζ], and the norm defined via those embeddings. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object.\n\nThus:\n\nAssumption:\nζ = e^(2πi/5),\nK = ℚ(ζ),\nα ∈ ℤ[ζ],\nThe norm N(α) is the product σ₁(α)σ₂(α)σ₃(α)σ₄(α),\nσ_i(ζ) = ζ^i.\n\nBut the original problem's exact statement is: \"prove that the norm of α ∈ ℤ[ζ] is of the form 1/4(A² -5B²) where A, B ∈ ℤ.\" So the problem's assumptions are ζ, K, α in ℤ[ζ], and the definition of the norm via the embeddings. Each of these should be separate lines.\n\nBut maybe some of these are part of the problem setup rather than assumptions. For example, the definition of K and ζ are part of the problem's context. The key assumptions here are that α is in ℤ[ζ], and the norm is defined as the product of those specific embeddings.\n\nSo, structured:\n\nAssumption:\nζ is a primitive 5th root of unity (i.e., ζ = e^(2πi/5)),\nK is the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ),\nα is an element of ℤ[ζ],\nThe norm N(α) is calculated as σ₁(α)σ₄(α)σ₂(α)σ₃(α),\nσ_i denotes the embedding defined by σ_i(ζ) = ζ^i.\n\nEach of these is a single condition on one object. Now, the problem is to prove that this norm is of the form ¼(A² -5B²) with integers A, B.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then the problem statement.",
