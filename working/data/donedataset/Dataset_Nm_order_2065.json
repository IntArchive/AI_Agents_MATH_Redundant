    "Content": "Problem statement Let $x,y$ be two real positive numbers. Prove that $$x^xy^y\\geq\\dfrac{x^2+y^2}{2}.$$ (recommend solution with high school knowledge) First approach: Bernoulli inequality Case 1: $x\\geq 1, y\\geq1$ I use the Bernoulli inequality that $$(1+x)^r\\geq 1+rx,$$ for all $x>-1$ and for all $r\\geq1$ . Hence for $x\\geq1$ we have $$x^x=\\left(1+\\left(x-1\\right)\\right)^x\\geq 1+x\\left(x-1\\right)=x^2-x+1.$$ (I am wondering that whether applying is correct or not, because, intuitively, $x^x$ is not the same as $x^r$ . But if I fix for $x_0\\geq0$ , then I can apply Bernoulli inequality for $x=x_0-1$ and $r=x_0$ . Since $x_0$ is taken arbitrarily, we obtain the result for all $x\\geq1$ . Please let me know if there is any misunderstood). So that we have obtain that $$x^xy^x\\geq \\left(x^2-x+1\\right)\\left(y^2-y+1\\right).$$ We will show that $$\\left(x^2-x+1\\right)\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)\\geq \\dfrac{x^2+y^2}{2}$$ which is equivalent to $$\\left(y^2-y+\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)x^2-\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)x+\\left(\\dfrac{y^2}{2}-y+1\\right)\\geq0.$$ We have the discriminant $$\\Delta = \\left(y^2-y+1\\right)^2-4\\left(y^2-y+\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{y^2}{2}-y+1\\right)=-\\left(y-1\\right)^2\\leq0.$$ Since $\\left(y^2-y+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)>0$ , the case for $x,y\\geq 1$ is proved. I meet the stuck with three remaining cases. Please help me if you would like to follow this approach. Thank you. Second approach: first-order optimality condition Consider the function $$h(t) = f(t,y):=y^yt^t-\\dfrac{t^2}{2}-\\dfrac{y^2}{2},$$ for $t>0$ . Then the first derivative is given by $$f'(t)=y^yt^t\\left(\\log t+1\\right)-t$$ Solving the equation $f'(t)=0$ gives $$g(t):=\\dfrac{t^{1-t}}{1+\\log t}=y^y$$ here we can easily see that $t=e^{-1}$ is not a solution. We will show that $g$ is decreasing on each well-defined intervals. We have $$g'(t)=-\\dfrac{t^{-t}\\left(t\\left(1+\\log t\\right)^2-\\log t\\right)}{\\left(1+\\log t\\right)^2}$$ If $t\\in(0,1)\\setminus\\{ e^{-1}\\})$ , then $\\log t <0$ , so that $t\\left(1+\\log t\\right)^2-\\log t>0$ , and hence $g'(t)<0$ . If $t\\geq1$ then $t\\left(1+\\log t\\right)^2-\\log t \\geq \\left(1+\\log t\\right)^2-\\log t>0$ , and thus $g'(t)<0$ . Since $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} g(t)=0$ and $lim_{t\\to {e^{-1}}^-} g(t) = -\\infty$ and $lim_{t\\to {e^{-1}}^+} g(t)=+\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to +\\infty} g(t) = 0$ , we can conclude that the equation $g(t)=y^y$ has a unique solution, say $\\alpha_y\\geq \\frac{1}{e}$ . We now obtain that $$f(x,y) \\geq h(\\alpha_y)=\\alpha_y^{\\alpha_y}y^y-\\dfrac{\\alpha_y^2}{2}-\\dfrac{y^2}{2}=\\dfrac{\\alpha_y}{1+\\log(\\alpha_y)}-\\dfrac{\\alpha_y^2}{2}-\\dfrac{y^2}{2}.$$ Note that $\\alpha_y$ is dependent of $y$ , i.e., $\\alpha_y = g^{-1}(y^y)$ . I try to eliminate the exponential term, but it is still difficult for me to handle. Please help me some ideas. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a proof . Taking logarithm, it suffices to prove that $$x\\ln x + y \\ln y \\ge \\ln\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}. \\tag{1}$$ Using $\\mathrm{e}^u \\ge 1 + u$ for all reals $u$ , letting $u = \\frac12\\ln\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}$ , we have $$\\ln {\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} \\le 2\\sqrt{\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} - 2. \\tag{2}$$ From (1) and (2), it suffices to prove that $$x\\ln x + y \\ln y \\ge \\sqrt{2x^2 + 2y^2} - 2. \\tag{3}$$ Note that $$\\sqrt{2x^2 + 2y^2} - (x + y) = \n\\frac{(x - y)^2}{\\sqrt{2x^2 + 2y^2} + x + y}\n\\le \\frac{(x - y)^2}{x + y + x + y}. \\tag{4}$$ From (3) and (4), it suffices to prove that $$x\\ln x + y \\ln y \\ge x + y + \\frac{(x - y)^2}{2x + 2y} - 2. \\tag{5}$$ To proceed, we need the following result. Fact 1 . For all $u > 0$ , $$u\\ln u \\ge \\frac{(5u+1)(u-1)}{2u+4}.$$ ( Note : The RHS is the $(2, 1)$ Pade approximation at $u = 1$ of $u\\ln u$ .) ( Proof : Let $h(u) := \\ln u - \\frac{1}{u}\\cdot\\frac{(5u+1)(u-1)}{2u+4}$ .\nWe have $h'(u) = \\frac{(u-1)^3}{u^2(u+2)^2}$ . Thus, $h(u)$ is strictly decreasing on $(0, 1)$ , and strictly increasing on $(1, \\infty)$ .\nNote also that $h(1) = 0$ . Thus, we have $h(u)\\ge 0$ for all $u > 0$ . ) Using Fact 1, it suffices to prove that $$\\frac{(5x+1)(x-1)}{2x+4} + \\frac{(5y+1)(y-1)}{2y+4} \\ge x + y + \\frac{(x - y)^2}{2x + 2y} - 2$$ or \\begin{align*}\n\t&2{x}^{3}y + 8{x}^{2}{y}^{2} + 2x{y}^{3} + 4{x}^{3} - 4{x}^{2}y -4x{\n\t\ty}^{2}+4{y}^{3}\\\\\n\t&\\qquad -13{x}^{2}-10xy-13{y}^{2}+12x+12y\\\\\n\t \\ge{}& 0. \\tag{6}\n\\end{align*} Let $p = x + y, q = xy$ . Then $p^2 \\ge 4q$ . (6) is written as $$4q^2 + (2p^2 - 16p + 16)q + 4p^3 - 13p^2 + 12p \\ge 0.$$ The rest is smooth. Actually, (6) can be written as \\begin{align*}\n\t&{\\frac { \\left( 4\\,{x}^{2}+8\\,xy+4\\,{y}^{2}-13\\,x-13\\,y+12 \\right) \n\t\t\t\\left( x-y \\right) ^{4}}{ \\left( x+y \\right) ^{3}}}\\\\\n\t\t&\\qquad +{\\frac {\n\t\t\t2\\left( x+y+12 \\right)  \\left( x+y-2 \\right) ^{2} \\left( x-y \\right) ^\n\t\t\t{2}xy}{ \\left( x+y \\right) ^{3}}}\\\\\n\t\t&\\qquad +{\\frac { 12\\left( x+y+4 \\right) \n\t\t\t\\left( x+y-2 \\right) ^{2}{x}^{2}{y}^{2}}{ \\left( x+y \\right) ^{3}}}\n\t\\ge 0\n\\end{align*} which is clearly true. We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that for positive real numbers x and y, the inequality x^x y^y ≥ (x² + y²)/2 holds. The user has attempted two approaches and is stuck on some parts.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states x and y are real positive numbers. So each assumption should be a single condition on one object. So, \"x is a positive real number\" and \"y is a positive real number\". That's two separate assumptions.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that x^x y^y is greater than or equal to (x² + y²)/2. The user also mentions that a solution with high school knowledge is preferred, but that might not be part of the problem statement itself. The problem statement in the title and the beginning is clear: Prove that x^x y^y ≥ (x² + y²)/2 for positive real numbers x and y.\n\nLooking at the example provided, they had to extract the assumptions, which were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are simply that x and y are positive reals. The problem is the inequality to prove.\n\nThe user's attempts with Bernoulli's inequality and optimality conditions are part of their solution attempts, but according to the format, we need to filter out unrelated information. So the key problem is the inequality with the assumptions on x and y. The rest about different cases and approaches are part of the user's attempt, which we don't include in the structured problem.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a positive real number\n- y is a positive real number\n\nProblem: Prove that x^x y^y ≥ (x² + y²)/2.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't mention any restrictions like x and y being integers or greater than 1, just positive reals. The user tried cases where x and y are ≥1, but that's their approach, not part of the original problem's conditions. So the only assumptions are x and y being positive real numbers.",
