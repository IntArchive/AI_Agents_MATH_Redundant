    "Content": "The first few powers of $5$ are given by: \\begin{array}{r}\n5 \\\\\n25 \\\\\n125 \\\\\n625 \\\\\n3125 \\\\\n15625\\\\\n                                        78125\\\\\n                                       390625\\\\\n                                     1953125\\\\\n                                    9765625\\\\\n                                   48828125\\\\\n                                  244140625\\\\\n                                 1220703125\\\\\n                                  6103515625\\\\\n\\end{array} We can see that the last digit is always $5$ and the second to last digit is always $2$. The preceding digit cycles between $1$ and $6$, and the one before that between $3,5,8$ and $0$. We can continue: \\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{digit} & \\text{period} \\\\\n1 & 5\\\\\n2 & 2\\\\\n3 & 16\\\\\n4 & 3580\\\\\n5 & 17956240\\\\\n6 & 3978175584236200\n\\end{array} Apart from the first 2 $(5$ and $2)$ we see that all these periods appear to be congruent to 7 modulo 9. Can this be proven?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Write $a\\%n$ for the least non-negative integer congruent to $a$ modulo $n$, i.e. $a\\%n=r$ iff $a\\equiv r\\pmod{n}$ and $0\\le r<n$.\nIn particular, $a\\% 10^k$ is the number represented by the last $k$ digits of $a$. Note that the cycle of the last four digits contains $625,3125,5625,8125$, which are $1,5,9,13$ times $5^4$. Similarly the cycle of the last five digits contains\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n3125 = 1\\times 5^5 & 53125 = 17\\times 5^5 \\\\\n15625 = 5\\times 5^5 & 65625 = 21\\times 5^5 \\\\\n28125 = 9\\times 5^5 & 78125 = 25\\times 5^5 \\\\\n40625 = 13\\times 5^5 & 90625 = 29\\times 5^5\n\\end{array}\n$$ In general, these cycles have the following properties for $k>1$: P1 : $5^n\\%10^k$ repeats in a cycle of length $2^{k-2}$ for $n\\ge k$. P2 : These sets, which we will denote by $S_k$, are the same, formalizing the pattern alluded to above:\n$$S_k = \\left\\{5^n\\% 10^k\\right\\}_{n=k}^{k+2^{k-2}-1}\n= \\left\\{(4n+1)5^k\\right\\}_{n=0}^{2^{k-2}-1}$$ Let $$A_k = \\sum_{x\\in S_k} x \\\\\nB_k = \\sum_{x\\in S_k} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{x}{10^{k-1}}\\right\\rfloor = \\sum_{x\\in S_k} \\frac{x - (x\\%10^{k-1})}{10^{k-1}}\n$$\nThen $B_k$ is the sum of the digits in the number called the \"period\" in the question, which is congruent to the number modulo $9$. From P1 , for $k>2$ one cycle of the last $k$ digits contains two cycles of the last $k-1$ digits, so\n$$\nA_k = 10^{k-1} B_k + 2 A_{k-1} \\\\\nB_k \\equiv A_k-2A_{k-1} \\pmod {9}\n$$\nthat is, we can break down $A_k$ into two sums of the last $k-1$ digits and a sum of the first digits times $10^{k-1}$. From P2 we can evaluate $A_k$:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nA_k & = \\sum_{n=0}^{2^{k-2}-1}(4n+1)5^k \\\\\n& = 5^k\\left[ \\left(4\\sum_{n=1}^{2^{k-2}-1} n\\right) + \\sum_{n=0}^{2^{k-2}-1} 1 \\right] \\\\\n& = 5^k\\left(4 \\frac{2^{k-2}(2^{k-2}-1)}{2} + 2^{k-2}\\right) \\\\\n& = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2} \\left(2^{k-1}-1\\right) \\\\\n& \\equiv 7 \\left(2^{k-1}-1\\right) \\pmod{9}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nfrom which it follows that\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nB_k & \\equiv A_k-2A_{k-1} \\\\\n& \\equiv 7 (2^{k-1}-1) - 2\\cdot 7(2^{k-2}-1) \\\\\n& \\equiv 7 \\pmod {9}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nestablishing the desired result. Now to fill in the blanks we'll prove P1 and P2 . First $2^n\\not\\mid n!$. The power of $2$ in $n!$ is $v_2(n!)=\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor + \\lfloor n/4 \\rfloor + \\lfloor n/8 \\rfloor + \\cdots<n$ (see e.g. this ). Hence $$2^n \\left\\vert \\binom{2^n}{i} 2^i \\right. = \\frac{2^n C}{i!} 2^{i} $$\nfor some $C\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen using the binomial theorem\n$$\n5^{2^{k-3}} = (1+4)^{2^{k-3}} = 1+2^{k-3}\\cdot 4 + \\sum_{i=2}^{2^{k-3}}\\binom{2^{k-3}}{i} 4^i \\equiv 2^{k-1}+1 \\pmod {2^k} \\\\\n5^{2^{k-2}} = (1+4)^{2^{k-2}} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{2^{k-2}}\\binom{2^{k-2}}{i} 4^i \\equiv 1 \\pmod {2^k}\n$$\nwhich establishes that the order of $5$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/2^k\\mathbb{Z}^{\\times}$ is $2^{k-2}$ (since it must also divide $2^{k-1}$). Hence for $1<k\\le n < k+2^{k-2}$, we always have $5^n\\%5^k=0$, and $5^n\\%2^k$ takes on exactly $2^{k-2}$ distinct values; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem $5^n\\%10^k$ also takes on exactly $2^{k-2}$ distinct values. This establishes P1 . Furthermore for $1<k\\le n < k+2^{k-2}$ every $5^n\\equiv (4j+1)5^k\\pmod{10^k}$ for some $j$, and there are exactly $2^{k-2}$ such possibilities, so every one must occur for exactly one choice of $n$ in this range. This establishes P2 .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original problem is about the pattern in decimal representations of powers of 5. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The user observed that the decimal digits of powers of 5 show certain periodicities beyond the first two digits. They provided a table where each digit position (starting from the right) has a certain period, and these periods after the first two digits seem congruent to 7 modulo 9. The question is whether this can be proven.\n\nNow, the task is to extract assumptions and the problem. The example given had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about the periodicity of digits in powers of 5 and their congruence modulo 9. \n\nLooking for assumptions in the problem: The question mentions powers of 5, so the base is 5. The periods mentioned start from the third digit onwards (since the first two digits are fixed as 5 and 2). The key observation is that these periods are congruent to 7 modulo 9. The problem is to prove this congruence for all the periods beyond the first two digits.\n\nBut wait, what are the explicit assumptions here? The problem states \"apart from the first 2 (5 and 2) we see that all these periods appear to be congruent to 7 modulo 9.\" The user is asking if this can be proven. \n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Considering the decimal representation of powers of 5.\n2. Looking at the digits starting from the third position from the right (since the first two are fixed as 5 and 2).\n3. The periods mentioned correspond to the repeating cycle of each digit in their respective positions.\n4. Each of these periods (for digits beyond the second) is conjectured to be congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state any explicit conditions; it's more of an observation followed by a question. So maybe the assumptions are minimal here. Since the problem is about powers of 5, the base is 5. The periods are for each digit position beyond the first two. The key thing is that each period (length) for these digits is congruent to 7 mod 9. The problem is to prove this congruence.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption: The decimal representation of 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The period of the digit cycle in each position (beyond the first two digits) is considered.\nAssumption: For each digit position beyond the second, the period is conjectured to be congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumptions were specific properties applied to one object. Here, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion of powers of 5 is considered.\nAssumption: The period of the nth digit (for n ≥ 3) in the decimal expansion of powers of 5 is considered.\nAssumption: The period lengths for n ≥ 3 are congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut the problem is whether this congruence can be proven. So, the problem is to prove that for each digit position beyond the second in the decimal expansion of powers of 5, the period of that digit's cycle is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, perhaps the assumptions are more about the context of the problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example: The problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91. The assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, in that problem, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That would change the problem. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to modify the problem. Maybe the original problem was different. Anyway, perhaps the example is to show how to structure.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original question is: \"Apart from the first 2 (5 and 2) we see that all these periods appear to be congruent to 7 modulo 9. Can this be proven?\"\n\nSo, the problem is to prove that for each digit position beyond the second, the period of that digit in the decimal expansion of powers of 5 is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion of 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The period of the nth digit (for n ≥ 3) in the decimal expansion is considered.\nProblem: Prove that each period for n ≥ 3 is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more precise. But since the periods mentioned are for each digit position, like digit 3 has period 16, digit 4 period 3580, etc., and these are each periods of the digit's cycle. The question is whether each such period is ≡7 mod9.\n\nSo, the problem is: Prove that for each digit position n ≥3 in the decimal representation of powers of 5, the period of the digit's cycle is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n\n- Considering the decimal representation of 5^k for positive integers k.\n- For each digit position n ≥3, the digit cycles with some period.\n- The periods mentioned (16, 3580, 17956240, etc.) are the lengths of these cycles.\n\nProblem: Prove that each of these periods is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: The decimal expansion of powers of 5 is considered.\nAssumption: For each digit position beyond the second, the digit cycles with a certain period.\nProblem: Prove that each such period is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The decimal representation of 5^k is examined.\nAssumption: For each digit position n ≥3, the digit cycles periodically as k increases.\nAssumption: The period length of the digit cycle for each n ≥3 is considered.\n\nProblem: Prove that each period length is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut maybe even simpler. Since the problem is about the periods of digits in decimal expansions of 5^k beyond the first two digits, and wanting to show the period lengths ≡7 mod9.\n\nSo, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. We are considering the decimal digits of 5^k for positive integers k.\n2. For each digit position beyond the second (i.e., third digit onwards), the digit cycles with a certain period.\n3. The problem is to prove that each of these periods is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line. So:\n\nAssumption: The decimal representation of 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The period of the digit cycle in the nth position (n ≥3) is considered.\nProblem: Prove that each period is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption: 5^k is computed for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The decimal digits of 5^k are analyzed beyond the second digit from the right.\nAssumption: Each digit beyond the second cycles with a certain period as k increases.\nProblem: Prove that each of these periods is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut the problem is as stated by the user. Let me check the exact wording in the question: \"Apart from the first 2 $(5$ and $2)$ we see that all these periods appear to be congruent to 7 modulo 9. Can this be proven?\"\n\nSo, the problem is: Can it be proven that all these periods (for digits beyond the first two) are congruent to 7 modulo 9?\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The decimal representation of 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The periods of digit cycles in positions n ≥3 are considered.\nProblem: Prove that each period is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut the example given by the user had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The problem then was to prove divisibility by 91. So, in that case, the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, that might be an error, unless the original problem had a typo. But maybe the example is just illustrative.\n\nIn our case, the problem as posed by the user is about the periods in the decimal digits of powers of 5, beyond the first two digits, and their congruence modulo 9. So, the key assumptions are the decimal representation and the consideration of periods beyond the first two digits.\n\nHence, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: The decimal representation of 5^k is considered for positive integers k.\nAssumption: The period of the digit cycle in each position n ≥3 is considered.\nProblem: Prove that each such period is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nBut to make sure each assumption is one line and addresses one property or object:\n\nAssumption: 5^k is expressed in decimal form for positive integers k.\nAssumption: For each digit position n ≥3, the digit cycles with a certain period.\nProblem: Prove that each period is congruent to 7 modulo 9.\n\nYes, this seems correct.",
