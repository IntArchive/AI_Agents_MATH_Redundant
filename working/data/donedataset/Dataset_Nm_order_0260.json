    "AcceptedAnswer": "I will assume that the reader is capable of finding that there are exactly 12 such polynomials in degree $3$ or less, by brute force if necessary. Assume the degree of such a polynomial $f(x)$ is at least 4 for the sake of contradiction.  Let the leading coefficients be $f(x) = x^n - Ax^{n-1} + Bx^{n-2} - C x^{n-3} + Dx^{n-4} + \\ldots$.  This convention is adopted so that the values $A,B,C,D\\in \\{\\pm 1\\}$ are the first four elementary symmetric polynomials in the roots.  That is, if $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_n$ are the $n$ real roots of $f(x)$, we have $A = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i =\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\ldots + \\alpha_n$ $B = \\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i\\alpha_j = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\ldots + \\alpha_{n-1}\\alpha_n$ $C = \\sum_{1 \\le i<j<k\\le n}\\alpha_i\\alpha_j\\alpha_k$ $D = \\sum_{1 \\le i<j<k<l\\le n}\\alpha_i\\alpha_j\\alpha_k\\alpha_l$ Remember that $\\alpha_i^2 > 0 $ holds for all $i$ (nonzero constant term) and all of $A,B,C,D$ square to $1$.  We will now use Newton's identities to compute some values that must be positive.\n$$\\begin{align*}\n0 < \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^2 & = A^2-2B = 1-2B\\\\\n0 < \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^4 & = A^4-4A^2B + 2B^2 + 4AC - 4D\\\\\n& = 3 - 4B + 4AC - 4D\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nIn particular, from $0 < 1-2B$ we conclude $B = -1$ and the first sum must be 3.\nThe second sum is thus simplified to $7+4AC-4D$.\nNext we note the identity\n$$\n9 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^2 \\right)^2\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^4 + 2\\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\n$$\nthen implies\n$$\n0 <\\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(9 - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^4 \\right)\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(9 - (7+4AC-4D)\\right)\n= 1 -2AC + 2D\n$$\nNow, we note that $AC-D \\in \\{-2, 0, 2\\}$, but $0 < 7+4AC-4D$ tells us it cannot be $-2$, and $0< 1 - 2AC+2D$ tells us it cannot be $2$.  Thus, it must be $0$, and in particular the above sum simplifies to $1-2AC+2D = 1$.  We now perform one final calculation and rearrangement\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n3 = 3\\cdot 1 & = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\alpha_i^2 \\right)\n\\left(\\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\\right)\n= \\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i^4\\alpha_j^2\n+ 3 \\sum_{1 \\le i<j<k\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\\alpha_k^2\\\\\n0 < \\sum_{1 \\le i<j\\le n} \\alpha_i^4\\alpha_j^2\n& = 3 \\left( 1 - \\sum_{1 \\le i<j<k\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\\alpha_k^2\\right) \n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThis last line is a contradiction, because $\\sum_{1 \\le i<j<k\\le n} \\alpha_i^2\\alpha_j^2\\alpha_k^2$ is (by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials ) a polynomial in the coefficients of $f$, and is therefore at least $1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user wants to prove that there are only 12 polynomials with all real roots, coefficients all -1 or 1, no zero coefficients, and constant polynomials don't count. They mention two examples: x-1 and x+1. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem's conditions.\n\n1. The polynomial must have all real roots. So, every root is a real number.\n2. Coefficients are all either -1 or 1. That means each coefficient (from the leading term down to the constant term) can't be anything else.\n3. Zero coefficients are not allowed. So, no missing terms; the polynomial must be complete in the sense that all coefficients are present and either -1 or 1.\n4. Constant polynomials do not count. So, the degree must be at least 1. Because a constant polynomial has degree 0, and we're excluding those.\n5. The problem is to show there are only 12 such polynomials. The two given examples are linear, so maybe others are higher degree but still limited.\n\nWait, the problem says \"only 12 polynomials exist with given properties\". The user is asking for a proof of that. So, the assumptions should capture all the constraints given. Let me list each condition as a separate assumption.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial has all real roots.\n- All coefficients of the polynomial are either -1 or 1.\n- The polynomial has no zero coefficients.\n- The polynomial is not a constant polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the original problem mentions \"coefficients are all -1 or 1\" and \"zero coefficients are not allowed\". So each coefficient is non-zero and either -1 or 1. So, combining those two, perhaps each coefficient is in {-1, 1}, so no zeros. Therefore, two separate assumptions: coefficients are in {-1,1}, and no zero coefficients? Wait, but if coefficients are all -1 or 1, then there are no zero coefficients by definition. So maybe the user is just emphasizing that zero coefficients are not allowed. Wait, the original problem says: \"zero coefficients are not allowed, and constant polynomials do not count.\" So maybe \"no zero coefficients\" is a separate condition, even though if coefficients are all -1 or 1, that would imply no zeros. But perhaps the problem statement is redundant here. But since the user included both, I should list them as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, actually, if the coefficients are all -1 or 1, then zero coefficients are not allowed, so maybe \"zero coefficients are not allowed\" is redundant. But the problem statement mentions both, so perhaps the user wants to emphasize that even if there's a term with coefficient zero, it's not allowed. So the problem requires that all coefficients are non-zero (i.e., the polynomial is \"dense\") and each coefficient is either -1 or 1. So maybe two separate assumptions: coefficients are -1 or 1, and all coefficients are non-zero (so no missing terms). Wait, but in standard terminology, \"coefficients are all -1 or 1\" would already imply that there are no zero coefficients. For example, a quadratic polynomial with coefficients 1, -1, 1 would be x² - x + 1. But if the problem says \"zero coefficients are not allowed\", that might mean that all terms from the leading term down to the constant term must be present. For example, a cubic polynomial can't be missing the x² term. So, for example, if the polynomial is of degree 3, then it must have x³, x², x, and constant terms, each with coefficient -1 or 1. Therefore, \"no zero coefficients\" here means that the polynomial is \"complete\" with all terms present, each with coefficient ±1. So, for example, a quadratic polynomial must be of the form ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are each ±1. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The polynomial has all real roots.\n- All coefficients are either -1 or 1.\n- The polynomial has no zero coefficients (i.e., all terms from the leading degree down to the constant term are present with coefficients ±1).\n- The polynomial is not a constant polynomial (i.e., degree ≥ 1).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"constant polynomials do not count\". So, the degree must be at least 1. So the fourth assumption is that the polynomial is non-constant. So, putting this all together:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial has all real roots.\n- Each coefficient of the polynomial is either -1 or 1.\n- The polynomial has no zero coefficients.\n- The polynomial is non-constant.\n\nBut wait, \"no zero coefficients\" is redundant if each coefficient is already required to be -1 or 1. Unless the problem is allowing polynomials of degree n to have terms missing (like x³ + x + 1, which would have a zero coefficient for x²), but here the user says \"zero coefficients are not allowed\", meaning that all terms must be present with coefficients ±1. Therefore, \"no zero coefficients\" is a separate condition, ensuring that the polynomial is \"dense\" (all terms present). For example, a cubic polynomial must have x³, x², x, and constant terms, each with coefficient ±1. So that is indeed a separate condition from coefficients being ±1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial has all real roots.\n- All coefficients of the polynomial are in {-1, 1}.\n- The polynomial contains no zero coefficients (i.e., all terms from the leading term to the constant term are present).\n- The polynomial is non-constant (degree ≥ 1).\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the formatted problem for the divisibility question included two assumptions: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem's original conditions include multiple aspects, each as separate assumptions. So, following the example, each bullet point in the Assumption section is a single condition applied to one object. So in this case, each condition related to the polynomial should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo, the correct Assumption section would list each condition:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial has all real roots.\n- All coefficients of the polynomial are either -1 or 1.\n- The polynomial has no zero coefficients.\n- The polynomial is non-constant.\n\nEach of these is a single condition applied to the polynomial. Now, the problem statement is to prove that there are only 12 such polynomials. So the problem would be: \"Prove that there are only 12 polynomials that satisfy the above conditions.\"\n\nBut let me check the example again. The example's problem was structured as:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that [expression] is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in the example, each assumption is a separate condition. Similarly, here, each of the four conditions for the polynomial should be separate assumptions.\n\nSo the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial has all real roots.\nAll coefficients of the polynomial are either -1 or 1.\nThe polynomial has no zero coefficients.\nThe polynomial is non-constant.\nProblem:\nProve that there are only 12 such polynomials.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"Two of them are obviously x-1 and x+1\". However, in the formatted problem, we don't include examples, just the problem statement. The example given in the user's example also didn't include the examples (like mentioning 5^n etc. was in the original, but the formatted problem just states the problem). Therefore, the problem statement here is exactly as the user wrote: \"Prove that there are only 12 polynomials that have all real roots, and whose coefficients are all -1 or 1. (Zero coefficients are not allowed, and constant polynomials do not count.)\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem, we need to restate this concisely, incorporating the assumptions. Wait, but according to the user's example, the problem is restated with the assumptions listed separately, and the problem is phrased as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in the current case, the problem would be \"Prove that there are only 12 polynomials that have all real roots, with coefficients all -1 or 1, no zero coefficients, and are non-constant.\"\n\nBut in the formatted problem section, we need to phrase the problem concisely, incorporating the assumptions. Wait, in the example, the assumptions are listed, and the problem is stated as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that there are only 12 polynomials that satisfy the given conditions.\"\n\nWait, but in the user's example, the original problem had the assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then in the formatted problem, the assumptions are listed, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. So the problem is restated concisely, with the assumptions separated.\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the formatted problem should list the assumptions and then the problem statement as \"Prove that there are only 12 such polynomials.\" But perhaps more precise.\n\nAlternatively, in the original problem, the user wrote: \"Prove that there are only 12 polynomials that have all real roots , and whose coefficients are all $-1$ or $1$ . ( zero coefficients are not allowed, and constant polynomials do not count. )\"\n\nSo in the formatted version, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe polynomial has all real roots.\nAll coefficients are either -1 or 1.\nThe polynomial has no zero coefficients.\nThe polynomial is non-constant.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are only 12 such polynomials.\n\nBut the user's example had the problem part as the original problem's main claim. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother check: in the user's example, the original problem had an expression A(n) defined, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem's assumptions list those two, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91.\n\nSimilarly here, the original problem's main claim is the existence of only 12 polynomials under the given conditions. Therefore, the problem part is to prove that there are only 12 such polynomials, with the assumptions listed separately.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe polynomial has all real roots.\nAll coefficients of the polynomial are either -1 or 1.\nThe polynomial has no zero coefficients.\nThe polynomial is non-constant.\nProblem:\nProve that there are only 12 such polynomials.",
