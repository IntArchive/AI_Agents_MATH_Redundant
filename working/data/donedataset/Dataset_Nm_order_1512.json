    "Content": "Let $f:[0,1] \\longrightarrow \\mathbb R$ be a continuous function, and let $g:\\mathbb R \\longrightarrow \\mathbb R$ be a continuous and periodic function with period $1$. Prove that $\\displaystyle\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\int_0^1f(x)g(nx)dx=\\left(\\int_0^1f(x)dx\\right)\\left(\\int_0^1g(x)dx\\right)$. any Ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note that for positive integer $n$, we have\n$$\\tag{1}\\int_0^1f(x)g(nx)dx=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\int_{\\frac{i}{n}}^{\\frac{i+1}{n}}f(x)g(nx)dx.$$\nWe change the variable by letting $y=nx$, then $dx=dy/n$. For $i=0,1,..., n-1$, we have \n$$\\tag{2}\\int_{\\frac{i}{n}}^{\\frac{i+1}{n}}f(x)g(nx)dx=\\frac{1}{n}\\int_{i}^{i+1}f(\\frac{y}{n})g(y)dy=\\frac{1}{n}f(\\zeta_i)\\int_{i}^{i+1}g(y)dy$$\nwhere $\\zeta_i\\displaystyle\\in[\\frac{i}{n},\\frac{i+1}{n}]$. Here we have used the mean-value theorem in the last equality. By assumption that $g$ has period $1$, by $(2)$ we have\n$$\\int_{\\frac{i}{n}}^{\\frac{i+1}{n}}f(x)g(nx)dx=\\frac{1}{n}f(\\zeta_i)\\int_{0}^{1}g(y)dy.$$\nPut this back to $(1)$, we have\n$$\\int_0^1f(x)g(nx)dx=\\left(\\int_{0}^{1}g(y)dy\\right)\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n}f(\\zeta_i)$$\nwhere $\\zeta_i\\displaystyle\\in[\\frac{i}{n},\\frac{i+1}{n}]$. Note that by Riemann sum, we have\n$$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{1}{n}f(\\zeta_i)=\\int_0^1f(x)dx.$$\nThis proves the assertion.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows how assumptions are listed and the problem is stated.\n\nFirst, the original problem is about proving a limit involving integrals of functions f and g. The problem states that f is continuous on [0,1], and g is continuous and periodic with period 1. The goal is to show that the integral of f(x)g(nx) from 0 to 1 as n approaches infinity equals the product of the integrals of f and g over [0,1].\n\nI need to extract the assumptions. The first assumption is about f: it's defined on [0,1] and is continuous. The second assumption is about g: it's continuous on all real numbers, periodic with period 1. These are the key conditions. The problem then is to prove the limit statement.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n, but here the problem doesn't have additional constraints beyond the properties of f and g. So each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. So f is continuous on [0,1], and g is continuous and periodic with period 1. That's two separate assumptions. The problem is the limit of the integral equaling the product of the integrals.\n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The functions are given with their domains and continuity, periodicity for g. That's all. So the formatted answer should list those two assumptions and then state the problem as given.",
