    "Content": "Prove that $$\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} e^{-n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{n^k}{k!} = \\frac{1}{2}$$ This problem appeared on MSE many times, but each time it was solved using Poisson distribution or lots of integrals. I am wondering, is there any way to prove it using some basic properties of limits (their arithmetics, squeeze theorem etc.), definition of $e^x$ as $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}(1+\\frac{x}{n})^n$ , basic limits with $e$ , binomial expansion and logarithms, but without using integrals, series, Stirling formula, asymptotics, Taylor series? This problem was given to me by my mathematical analysis teacher, but it's not a homework, just additional problem to think on. My teacher claims it can be solved with knowledge introduced on lectures so far, which is not much, mainly things mentioned above. Of course, I can use theorems not mentioned on the lectures, but then I have to prove them, and again, with the baisc knowledge. I've been thinking about it for a few days and couldn't do any major progress in my attempts.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Table of Content. Heuristic argument Elementary proof, version 1. Elementary proof, version 2. (NEW!) 1. Heuristic argument. Although far from being rigorous, one can provide a heuristic computation which explains why we expect the answer to be $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Notice that $$ \\frac{n^{n+j}/(n+j)!}{n^n / n!} = \\begin{cases}\n\\prod_{k=1}^{j} \\frac{n}{n+k}, & j \\geq 1 \\\\\n1, & j = 0, -1 \\\\\n\\prod_{k=1}^{-j-1} \\frac{n-k}{n}, & j \\leq -2 \n\\end{cases}\n$$ In any of cases, taking logarithm and applying the approximation $\\log(1+x) \\approx x$ shows that the above quantity is approximately $e^{-j^2/2n}$ . So $$\ne^{-n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{n^k}{k!}\n= \\frac{\\sum_{j=-n}^{0} \\frac{n!}{n^n \\sqrt{n}} \\frac{n^{n+j}}{(n+j)!} }{\\sum_{j=-n}^{\\infty} \\frac{n!}{n^n \\sqrt{n}}\\frac{n^{n+j}}{(n+j)!} }\n\\approx \\frac{\\sum_{j=-n}^{0} e^{-(j/\\sqrt{n})^2/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} }{\\sum_{j=-n}^{\\infty} e^{-(j/\\sqrt{n})^2/2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} }\n\\approx \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} e^{-x^2/2} \\, dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2/2} \\, dx}\n= \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$ Most of the solutions that I know is more or less a rigorous realization of this kind of observation, and so, it is either involved or requiring extra knowledge. 2. Elementary proof, version 1. Define $A_n$ , $B_n$ and $C_n$ by $$ A_n := e^{-n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{n^k}{k!}, \\qquad B_n := e^{-n} \\sum_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^k}{k!}, \\qquad C_n = \\frac{n^{n} e^{-n}}{n!}. $$ From the Taylor expansion of the exponential function, we know that $A_n + B_n = 1$ . In order to show the desired convergence, it suffices to show that the following claim holds. Claim. $A_n/B_n \\to 1$ as $n\\to\\infty$ . Indeed, once this is proved, then both $A_n$ and $B_n$ converge to $\\frac{1}{2}$ as $n\\to\\infty$ . Proof of Claim. Using the substitution $k = n-j$ followed by $p = j-1$ , one may write \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{A_n}{C_n}\n&= \\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\frac{n!}{(n-j)!n^j}\n = 2 + \\sum_{p=1}^{n-1} \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( 1 - \\frac{l}{n} \\right).\n\\end{align*} Similarly, applying the substitution $k = n+p$ , one may write \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{B_n}{C_n}\n&= \\sum_{p=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n!n^p}{(n+p)!}\n = \\sum_{p=1}^{\\infty} \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{l}{n}} \\right).\n\\end{align*} 1. Estimation of leading sums. Fix $\\alpha \\in \\left( 0, \\frac{1}{3} \\right)$ and set $N = N(\\alpha) = \\left\\lceil n^{(1+\\alpha)/2} \\right\\rceil$ . Then using the asymptotic formula $1+x = e^{x+\\mathcal{O}(x^2)}$ as $x \\to 0$ , for $1 \\leq p \\leq N$ we have $$ \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( 1 - \\frac{l}{n} \\right)\n= \\exp\\left\\{ -\\frac{p^2}{2n} + \\mathcal{O}\\left( n^{-(1-3\\alpha)/2} \\right) \\right\\}\n= \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{l}{n}} \\right). $$ In particular, there exists a constant $C > 0$ , depending only on $\\alpha$ , such that $$ \\max\\Bigg\\{ \\prod_{l=1}^{N} \\left( 1 - \\frac{l}{n} \\right), \\prod_{l=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{l}{n}} \\right) \\Bigg\\} \\leq C e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}}. $$ 2. Estimation of tail sums. In this time, consider $p > N$ . Then we have $$ \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( 1 - \\frac{l}{n} \\right)\n\\leq C e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{N}{n} \\right)^{p-N}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{l}{n}} \\right)\n\\leq C e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{N}{n}} \\right)^{p-N}. $$ So the tail sum for $A_n/C_n$ can be bounded from above by $$ \\sum_{p=N+1}^{n-1} \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( 1 - \\frac{l}{n} \\right)\n\\leq Ce^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}} \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{N}{n} \\right)^k\n\\leq \\frac{Cn}{N} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}}\n\\leq Cn^{(1-\\alpha)/2} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}}, $$ and likewise, $$ \\sum_{p=N+1}^{\\infty} \\prod_{l=1}^{p} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{l}{n}} \\right)\n\\leq Ce^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}} \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{N}{N+n} \\right)^k\n\\leq \\frac{2Cn}{N} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}}\n\\leq 2Cn^{(1-\\alpha)/2} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}n^{\\alpha}}. $$ 3. Conclusion. Combining altogether, $$ \\frac{A_n}{B_n} = \\frac{\\left( 1 + o(1) \\right) \\sum_{p=1}^{N} e^{-\\frac{p^2}{2n}} + \\mathcal{O}(1)}{\\left( 1 + o(1) \\right) \\sum_{p=1}^{N} e^{-\\frac{p^2}{2n}} + o(1)}, $$ which can be easily shown to converge to $1$ as $n\\to\\infty$ , since $\\sum_{p=1}^{N} e^{-\\frac{p^2}{2n}} \\geq \\sqrt{n} \\, e^{-1/2} \\to \\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$ . (In fact, this sum is $(1+o(1))\\sqrt{\\pi n/2}$ as $n\\to\\infty$ .) 3. Elementary proof, version 2. In this answer, we do appeal to the concentration behavior of the sum, but rather utilize a mysterious identity from combinatorics. Write $A_n = e^{-n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{n^k}{k!}$ for the sequence of our interest. We also introduce the following auxiliary sequences: $$\na_n = \\frac{n^n}{n!e^n}, \\qquad\nb_n = (-1)^n \\binom{-1/2}{n} = \\frac{1}{4^n} \\binom{2n}{n},\n$$ Before proceeding, we make some observations. The key ingredients are the following identities $$ A_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k a_{n-k}, \\qquad 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k b_{n-k}. $$ The former one is quite non-trivial, and a proof can be found here . On the other hand, the latter one is easily proved by comparing both sides of $ \n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^n = \\frac{1}{1-x} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x}} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n x^n \\right)^2$ . Next, we have the following observation. Lemma. $ \\frac{a_n}{b_n} \\to \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $ as $n\\to\\infty$ . This lemma tells that, roughly $a_{k}a_{n-k} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} b_k b_{n-k}$ and hence $ A_n \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k b_{n-k} = \\frac{1}{2}$ . Indeed, this is an instance of the philosophy that `limit should be preserved under averaging', and so, it can be proved by a standard machinery. We separate the rigorous claim into a standalone result: Proposition. Let $(a_n), (b_n)$ be sequences in $(0, \\infty)$ such that $a_n/b_n \\to \\ell \\in (0, \\infty)$ ; $b_n \\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ ; $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k b_{n-k} = 1$ for all $n$ . Then $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k a_{n-k} \\to \\ell^2$ as $n\\to\\infty$ . Therefore, $A_n \\to \\frac{1}{2}$ is a direct consequence of this proposition together with the well-known fact that $b_n \\to 0$ . Indeed, this can be proved as follows: $$ b_n^2\n= \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (2n-1)}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdots (2n)} \\right)^2\n= \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{3 \\cdot 5}{4 \\cdot 4} \\right) \\cdots \\left( \\frac{(2n-3)(2n-1)}{(2n-2)(2n-2)} \\right) \\frac{2n-1}{4n^2}\n\\leq \\frac{1}{2n}. $$ Finally, we prove the claims above. Proof of Lemma. Using the identity $-\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{a+u} \\, du = a \\log (a+1) - a \\log a - 1$ for $a > 0$ , we notice that \\begin{align*}\n&- \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{n+k-1+u} \\, du \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left[ (n+k-1)\\log (n+k) - (n+k-1)\\log(n+k-1) - 1 \\right] \\\\\n&= (2n)\\log(2n) - n \\log n - n - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\log(n+k) \\\\\n&= \\log \\left[ \\left( \\frac{4n}{e} \\right)^n \\frac{n!}{(2n)!} \\right]\n = \\log \\left( \\frac{a_n}{b_n} \\right).\n\\end{align*} Then, using $ \\frac{1}{2(n+k)}\n\\leq  \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u}{n+k-1+u} \\, du\n\\leq \\frac{1}{2(n+k-1)} $ , we obtain $$ -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n+k-1}\n\\leq \\log \\left( \\frac{a_n}{b_n} \\right)\n\\leq -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n+k}. $$ Therefore the conclusion follows from the well-known limit $ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{k}{n}} \\frac{1}{n} \\to \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{dx}{1+x} = \\log 2$ . Proof of Proposition. Let $\\alpha, \\beta $ satisfy $0 < \\alpha < \\ell < \\beta$ . Then there exists $N$ such that $\\alpha \\leq \\frac{a_n}{b_n} \\leq \\beta$ for all $n \\geq N$ . So, if $n \\geq 2N$ , then $$ \\alpha^2 \\sum_{k=N}^{n-N} b_k b_{n-k}\n\\leq \\sum_{k=N}^{n-N} a_k a_{n-k}\n\\leq \\beta^2 \\sum_{k=N}^{n-N} b_k b_{n-k}. $$ Now let $M > 0$ be a bound of $a_n/b_n$ . Since $b_n \\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$ , we have $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} a_k a_{n-k} + \\sum_{k=n-N+1}^{n} a_k a_{n-k}\n= 2\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} a_k a_{n-k}\n\\leq 2M^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} b_k b_{n-k} \n\\xrightarrow[n\\to\\infty]{} 0 $$ Combining altogether and using $1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k b_{n-k}$ , $$ \\alpha^2 \\leq \\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k a_{n-k} \\leq \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k a_{n-k} \\leq \\beta^2. $$ Letting $\\alpha \\uparrow \\ell$ and $\\beta \\downarrow \\ell$ proves the desired identity. We conclude with some remarks. Remark. If we do not care about elementary solution, this approach can be simplified by showing that $A_n$ is bounded and decreasing, hence converges. By the identity $A_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k a_{n-k}$ , we have $$ (1-x) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} A_n x^n = \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n x^n}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} b_n x^n} \\right)^2, $$ hence by a version of abelian theorem , we obtain $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} A_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{a_n}{b_n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}. $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to prove that the limit as n approaches infinity of e^{-n} times the sum from k=0 to n of n^k/k! equals 1/2. And we need to do this using basic methods, without integrals, series expansions like Taylor or Stirling, or advanced probability concepts like Poisson distribution. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me recall that e^x is the limit as n approaches infinity of (1 + x/n)^n. Maybe that can be useful here. The sum in the problem looks similar to the expansion of e^n, which is the sum from k=0 to infinity of n^k/k!. But here, the sum is only up to k=n instead of infinity. So the difference between the sum up to n and the full series is the tail from k=n+1 to infinity. So perhaps the problem is related to the difference between the partial sum and the total sum of the series for e^n?\n\nWait, but the problem is about e^{-n} times the partial sum up to n. So that would be e^{-n} * sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{k=0}^n e^{-n} n^k /k!.\n\nWait a second, this expression looks like the probability that a Poisson random variable with parameter n is less than or equal to n. But the user specified not to use Poisson distribution. So we need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the definition of e^n. Since e^n = sum_{k=0}^\\infty n^k/k!, so the sum in the problem is the partial sum up to k=n. Then, the difference between e^n and the partial sum is the tail sum from k=n+1 to infinity. Therefore, the problem's expression is e^{-n} times the partial sum, which is 1 - e^{-n} times the tail sum. So, maybe we can express the limit as 1 minus the limit of e^{-n} times the tail sum. If we can show that the tail sum's limit is 1/2, then the original expression would approach 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. But how do we analyze the tail sum?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the central limit theorem? Since the sum involves terms that resemble a Poisson distribution, which for large n approximates a normal distribution. But the user doesn't want probability methods. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the definition of e^x as a limit. Since e^n = lim_{m->infty} (1 + n/m)^m. Wait, but how does that connect to the partial sum?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe relate the sum to a binomial probability. For example, consider a binomial distribution with parameters m and p= something. Wait, but the problem mentions avoiding Poisson distributions and series expansions. Maybe consider that when n is large, the sum from k=0 to n of n^k/k! is similar to integrating something? But the user doesn't want integrals.\n\nWait, the problem allows using the definition of e^x as the limit of (1 + x/n)^n, basic properties of limits, squeeze theorem, binomial expansion, logarithms. Maybe there's a way to relate the partial sum to this definition.\n\nLet me consider writing the sum as a binomial coefficient. Wait, the sum is sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{k=0}^n n^k /k!.\n\nAlternatively, note that sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = e^n - sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!. So then e^{-n} sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = 1 - e^{-n} sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nSo if we can show that e^{-n} sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k! approaches 1/2 as n approaches infinity, then the original limit would be 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nBut how to compute that sum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the sum using Stirling's formula for k! but the user said not to use Stirling's formula. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the terms around k=n contribute the most. So perhaps for k near n, the term n^k/k! is maximized. Then maybe approximate the sum as an integral, but integrals are not allowed. Alternatively, use the ratio between consecutive terms.\n\nLet me think about the ratio of consecutive terms in the sum. For the sum from k=0 to n of n^k/k!, the terms increase up to k=n and then decrease? Wait, for the Poisson distribution, the maximum term is around k=n. So the terms increase up to k=n and then decrease. But in our case, we're summing up to k=n. Wait, but in the Poisson distribution with λ=n, the terms would peak around k=n. So the sum from k=0 to n would be roughly half of the total sum? If the distribution is symmetric around n, but Poisson is not symmetric. Wait, but for large n, the Poisson distribution approximates a normal distribution with mean n and variance n. So the sum from k=0 to n would correspond to the probability that a normal variable with mean n is less than or equal to n, which is 1/2. But this is using probability concepts, which the user wants to avoid.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that the sum from k=0 to n of n^k/k! is approximately e^n / 2, then multiplying by e^{-n} gives 1/2. But how to show that without probability?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use generating functions or recursive relations.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding (1 + 1/n)^n, which is the definition of e. Wait, but how to connect that to the sum.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the difference between e^n and the sum up to n. Let me denote S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!. Then e^n - S(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nWe need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of e^{-n} S(n). So that's the same as the limit of 1 - e^{-n} (e^n - S(n)) = 1 - e^{-n} sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nSo we need to compute the limit of e^{-n} sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nAlternatively, let's denote that tail sum as T(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nSo, T(n) = e^n - S(n).\n\nThen, e^{-n} T(n) = 1 - e^{-n} S(n). So, the original problem is equivalent to showing that e^{-n} S(n) approaches 1/2, which implies that e^{-n} T(n) approaches 1/2 as well.\n\nBut how to analyze T(n)?\n\nAlternatively, consider the symmetry between S(n) and T(n). For large n, perhaps S(n) ≈ T(n), which would lead to S(n) ≈ e^n / 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding S(n) and T(n) in terms of their terms. The sum S(n) is the sum up to k=n, and T(n) is the sum from k=n+1 to infinity.\n\nFor a symmetric distribution around n, the sum up to n and the sum from n+1 would be equal. But the Poisson distribution with λ=n is not symmetric, but for large λ, it approximates a normal distribution with mean μ=λ and variance σ²=λ. Therefore, the probability that a normal variable is less than or equal to μ is 1/2. Hence, the sum up to n would be approximately half of e^n. But this uses probability concepts, which we need to avoid.\n\nBut since the user allows using basic properties, maybe we can use some form of the central limit theorem without invoking probability. However, the central limit theorem is a probability result, so perhaps that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use the definition of e^x as the limit of (1 + x/m)^m as m approaches infinity.\n\nWait, if we set m = n, then (1 + x/n)^n approaches e^x as n approaches infinity. But how does that relate to our sum?\n\nAlternatively, consider the binomial theorem. Suppose we have m trials, each with probability p, and then approximate the binomial distribution with parameters m and p. But maybe that's getting into probability again.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's consider the sum S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k /k!.\n\nNotice that S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k /k! = sum_{k=0}^n (n)^k /k!.\n\nWe can compare this to the expansion of e^n, which is the same sum from k=0 to infinity. So S(n) is the partial sum.\n\nWe need to evaluate the ratio S(n)/e^n as n approaches infinity, and show that it approaches 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, consider the recursive relation for the terms. Let's denote a_k = n^k /k!.\n\nThen, a_{k+1} = a_k * n/(k+1).\n\nSo the terms increase as long as n/(k+1) > 1, i.e., when k+1 < n, so k < n-1. Then, the maximum term occurs around k = n-1 or k = n.\n\nTherefore, the terms in the sum S(n) are increasing up to k ≈ n and then start decreasing. However, since we are summing up to k=n, the largest term is at k=n.\n\nWait, but for k=n, the term is n^n /n!.\n\nStirling's approximation says that n! ≈ n^n e^{-n} sqrt(2 pi n). So n^n /n! ≈ e^n / sqrt(2 pi n). But Stirling's approximation is not allowed here.\n\nBut maybe we can use some inequalities related to n! to bound the terms.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio between successive terms around k=n.\n\nLet’s look at a_{n} = n^n /n! and a_{n-1} = n^{n-1}/(n-1)!.\n\nThe ratio a_n /a_{n-1} = n /n = 1. So the terms at k=n-1 and k=n are equal? Wait, let's compute that.\n\nWait, a_{n} = n^n /n! = n * n^{n-1}/n! = n^{n}/n!.\n\na_{n-1} = n^{n-1}/(n-1)!.\n\nThen, a_n /a_{n-1} = [n^n /n!] / [n^{n-1}/(n-1)!] = [n^n /n!] * [(n-1)! /n^{n-1}] = n /n = 1.\n\nSo, the terms at k=n-1 and k=n are equal. Interesting. So the terms increase up to k=n-1, and then the term at k=n is equal to the term at k=n-1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum term occurs at k=n-1 and k=n, both equal in value.\n\nThen, the terms after k=n start decreasing. For k > n, a_{k+1} = a_k *n/(k+1). So for k >=n, k+1 >=n+1, so n/(k+1) <= n/(n+1) <1. So terms start decreasing after k=n.\n\nBut in our sum S(n), we are only summing up to k=n, so the last two terms are equal and are the maximum terms.\n\nNow, considering the sum S(n), which includes these maximum terms.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nMaybe, since the terms around k=n are the largest, we can approximate the sum S(n) by considering the contribution of these terms. However, without using integrals or advanced approximations, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S(n) is roughly equal to the sum from k=0 to infinity of n^k/k! multiplied by an indicator function that k <=n. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum S(n) as the expectation of some random variable. Wait, but that might involve probability again.\n\nWait, perhaps use generating functions. Let's consider the generating function G(x) = sum_{k=0}^n x^k/k!.\n\nThen, we are interested in G(n) and comparing it to e^n.\n\nBut not sure how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from basic limit properties. Let's consider that for large n, the sum S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nLet’s write this as sum_{k=0}^n [n^k/k! / e^n] * e^n. Then, e^{-n} S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n [n^k/k! / e^n]. But each term is the Poisson probability mass function with λ=n, evaluated at k. But since we can't use Poisson, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the expression resembles the probability that a binomial random variable with parameters m and p = n/m is less than or equal to n. If we set m = something. But this is getting into probability again.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the fact that (1 + 1/n)^n approaches e as n approaches infinity. Let's consider expanding (1 + 1/n)^{n^2} or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = e^n \\Gamma(n+1, n)/n!, where Γ is the incomplete gamma function. But this involves special functions which are probably beyond the allowed methods.\n\nAlternatively, consider the difference between S(n) and e^n. Let’s write S(n) = e^n - R(n), where R(n) is the tail sum. Then, e^{-n} S(n) = 1 - e^{-n} R(n). So if we can show that e^{-n} R(n) approaches 1/2, then the original limit is 1/2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral test for the tail sum, but integrals are not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Suppose that for some n, e^{-n} S(n) ≈ 1/2. But not sure how induction would help here.\n\nWait, maybe consider the ratio of consecutive terms. For k >=n, the terms decrease, so the tail sum R(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nBut each term is n^{k}/k! = n^{n+1}/(n+1)! * [n/(n+2)]^{k - (n+1)} ?\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, approximate the sum R(n) using the first term. The first term in R(n) is n^{n+1}/(n+1)!.\n\nBut n^{n+1}/(n+1)! = n^{n+1}/( (n+1) n! ) = n^n /n! * n / (n+1).\n\nFrom earlier, n^n /n! ≈ e^n / sqrt(2 pi n) by Stirling's formula, but we can't use that.\n\nSo, n^{n+1}/(n+1)! ≈ (e^n / sqrt(2 pi n)) * n / (n+1) ≈ e^n / sqrt(2 pi n) * (1 - 1/(n+1)) ≈ e^n / sqrt(2 pi n).\n\nBut again, using Stirling's approximation is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, consider that n^{n}/n! = e^n / sqrt(2 pi n) * (1 + o(1)), but again, Stirling's.\n\nSince we can't use Stirling's, maybe look for another way.\n\nAlternatively, use the recursive relation for the terms. Let's consider that for k >=n, the term a_{k+1} = a_k * n/(k+1).\n\nSo, starting from k=n, a_{n} = n^n /n!.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = a_n * n/(n+1).\n\na_{n+2} = a_{n+1} * n/(n+2) = a_n * n/(n+1) * n/(n+2).\n\nContinuing this way, the terms decay by a factor of n/(n+m) for each step m.\n\nSo, the tail sum R(n) = a_n [ n/(n+1) + n^2/( (n+1)(n+2) ) + ... ].\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, write R(n) = a_n sum_{m=1}^\\infty product_{i=1}^m [n/(n+i)].\n\nBut this product telescopes to n^m / (n+1)(n+2)...(n+m).\n\nWait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, approximate the sum R(n) as a geometric series. Since after k=n, each term is a fraction of the previous term. The ratio between a_{k+1} and a_k is n/(k+1). For k >n, this ratio is less than 1. But how much less?\n\nFor k =n + t, the ratio is n/(n + t +1). So for t <<n, the ratio is approximately 1 - (t+1)/n. So for small t, the terms decrease slowly, but as t increases, the ratio decreases.\n\nHowever, summing this series would require integrating or approximating, which might not be possible without advanced methods.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum S(n) + R(n) = e^n. So if we can show that S(n) and R(n) are approximately equal for large n, then each would be e^n /2. But how?\n\nPerhaps use symmetry or some property. Wait, but why would S(n) ≈ R(n)?\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(n) = e^{-n} S(n). We need to show that f(n) →1/2.\n\nNote that f(n) = sum_{k=0}^n e^{-n} n^k /k!.\n\nIf we can find a recursion relation for f(n). Let's compute f(n+1) in terms of f(n).\n\nBut f(n+1) = sum_{k=0}^{n+1} e^{-(n+1)} (n+1)^k /k!.\n\nNot sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio f(n+1)/f(n).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: Use the generating function approach. Let’s define f(n) = e^{-n} sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nThen, f(n) = e^{-n} sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{k=0}^n (n/e)^n n^{k -n}/k! = sum_{k=0}^n (n/e)^n / (n^{n -k} k!)).\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, write n^k/k! = e^n * [some term related to Poisson], but again, we can't use Poisson.\n\nWait, maybe use the fact that the sum is the integral of the Dirac delta function or something, but integrals are not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that for large n, the distribution is sharply peaked around k=n, so the sum up to k=n is about half of the total. But how to formalize this without probability?\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution m = n -k. For k from 0 to n, m goes from n to 0.\n\nWait, let's try substituting m = n -k. Then, sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{m=0}^n n^{n -m}/( (n -m)! ).\n\nBut n^{n -m} = n^n /n^m. So this becomes n^n sum_{m=0}^n 1/(n^m (n -m)! )).\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, approximate the sum using the midpoint. For example, split the sum into two parts: from k=0 to n - sqrt(n), and from k=n - sqrt(n) to n. The first part would be negligible, and the second part can be approximated. But this requires some form of integral estimation or asymptotic analysis, which might not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, use the squeeze theorem. Find two sequences that bound e^{-n} S(n) and both converge to 1/2.\n\nBut how to construct such sequences?\n\nAlternatively, pair terms from the sum S(n) and the tail R(n). For example, term k and term 2n -k. But since the Poisson distribution isn't symmetric, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding (1 + 1)^n using the binomial theorem. Wait, but that gives sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) which is 2^n, not related.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sum S(n) as a Riemann sum approximation. But the problem prohibits using integrals.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that e^{-n} S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n e^{-n} n^k /k!.\n\nIf we can relate this to the probability of some event in a combinatorial model. For example, the number of surjective functions or something. But this might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, consider generating a recurrence relation for f(n) = e^{-n} S(n).\n\nLet's compute f(n+1):\n\nf(n+1) = e^{-(n+1)} sum_{k=0}^{n+1} (n+1)^k /k!.\n\nWe can split the sum into up to n and the last term:\n\n= e^{-(n+1)} [ sum_{k=0}^n (n+1)^k /k! + (n+1)^{n+1}/(n+1)! ) ]\n\n= e^{-(n+1)} sum_{k=0}^n (n+1)^k /k! + e^{-(n+1)} (n+1)^{n+1}/(n+1)! )\n\nNow, compare this to f(n). Maybe find a relation between f(n+1) and f(n).\n\nBut it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, approximate (n+1)^k as n^k (1 + k/n). But this might be valid for large n.\n\nLet’s try approximating (n+1)^k ≈ n^k e^{k/n}. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that (n+1)^k = n^k (1 + 1/n)^k ≈ n^k e^{k/n}.\n\nBut this approximation might work for k not too large compared to n. But if k is up to n, then k/n is up to 1, so e^{k/n} = e^{1} when k =n. So maybe:\n\n(n+1)^k ≈ n^k e^{k/n}.\n\nThen, sum_{k=0}^n (n+1)^k /k! ≈ sum_{k=0}^n n^k e^{k/n} /k!.\n\nBut this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, write (n+1)^k = e^{k ln(n+1)} ≈ e^{k (ln n + 1/n)} = e^{k ln n} e^{k/n} = n^k e^{k/n}.\n\nSo sum_{k=0}^n (n+1)^k /k! ≈ sum_{k=0}^n n^k e^{k/n} /k!.\n\nBut this is similar to the original sum multiplied by e^{k/n}, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, take e^{-(n+1)} sum_{k=0}^n (n+1)^k /k! ≈ e^{-(n+1)} sum_{k=0}^n n^k e^{k/n} /k!.\n\nBut I don't see how this helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider that f(n+1) ≈ something in terms of f(n). Maybe not.\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that for large n, the terms around k=n dominate the sum S(n). So approximate the sum by the terms near k=n.\n\nAssume that the sum S(n) is dominated by terms where k is near n, say k =n - t for t small compared to n. Then, approximate the sum using a Taylor expansion around t=0.\n\nLet’s write k = n - t, where t ranges from 0 to n. Then, the term becomes n^{n - t}/( (n -t)! ).\n\nBut n^{n - t} = n^n /n^t.\n\nThe denominator is (n -t)! = n! / [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)].\n\nSo, n^{n - t}/(n -t)! = n^n / (n^t (n! / [n(n-1)...(n -t +1) )) )\n\n= n^n /n! * [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)] /n^t.\n\n= [n^n /n!] * [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)/n^t].\n\nNotice that [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)]/n^t = product_{i=0}^{t-1} (n -i)/n = product_{i=0}^{t-1} (1 - i/n).\n\nSo, the term becomes [n^n /n!] * product_{i=0}^{t-1} (1 - i/n).\n\nNow, if t is much smaller than n, then product_{i=0}^{t-1} (1 - i/n) ≈ e^{- \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} i/n } = e^{- t(t-1)/(2n)}.\n\nBut this approximation uses that ln(1 -x) ≈ -x for small x. So, the product is approximately e^{- t^2/(2n)} for small t.\n\nTherefore, the term becomes [n^n /n!] * e^{- t^2/(2n)}.\n\nBut [n^n /n!] ≈ e^{n} /sqrt(2 pi n) by Stirling's formula, which we can't use. However, even without Stirling, if we denote C(n) = n^n /n!, then the term is C(n) * e^{- t^2/(2n)}.\n\nThen, sum_{k=0}^n n^k /k! ≈ sum_{t=0}^n C(n) e^{- t^2/(2n)}.\n\nBut this sum is C(n) sum_{t=0}^n e^{- t^2/(2n)}.\n\nFor large n, the sum sum_{t=0}^n e^{- t^2/(2n)} can be approximated by an integral from t=0 to t=n of e^{- t^2/(2n)} dt.\n\nBut again, integrals are not allowed.\n\nHowever, if we consider that for large n, the sum is approximately the integral from t=0 to infinity of e^{- t^2/(2n)} dt = sqrt(2 pi n)/2.\n\nBut this would give sum_{t=0}^\\infty e^{- t^2/(2n)} ≈ sqrt(2 pi n)/2.\n\nTherefore, the sum S(n) ≈ C(n) * sqrt(2 pi n)/2.\n\nBut if C(n) =n^n /n! ≈ e^n /sqrt(2 pi n), then S(n) ≈ [e^n /sqrt(2 pi n)] * sqrt(2 pi n)/2 = e^n /2.\n\nTherefore, S(n) ≈ e^n /2, so e^{-n} S(n) ≈ 1/2.\n\nBut this uses Stirling's approximation and integrals, which are not allowed. So this approach is invalid for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to make this argument without explicitly using Stirling or integrals. Maybe through some symmetry or combinatorial argument.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that the sum S(n) and the tail R(n) are asymptotically equal. For example, using the property that for symmetric distributions around the mean, the cumulative distribution up to the mean is 1/2. But this is again probability-based.\n\nGiven that the problem appeared many times on MSE and the user's teacher claims it can be solved with basic methods, there must be a more elementary approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider the difference between e^n and S(n).\n\ne^n = S(n) + R(n), where R(n) = sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k!.\n\nWe need to show that S(n)/e^n → 1/2 as n→infty, so R(n)/e^n →1/2 as well.\n\nConsider the ratio R(n)/S(n). If we can show that R(n)/S(n) →1 as n→infty, then S(n)/e^n = S(n)/(S(n)+R(n)) →1/(1+1)=1/2.\n\nBut how to show R(n)/S(n) →1?\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio of consecutive terms in S(n) and R(n). For example, the terms in S(n) increase up to k=n, and the terms in R(n) decrease starting from k=n+1.\n\nBut without precise estimation of the terms, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: Use the recursion of the terms.\n\nLet’s denote a_k = n^k /k!.\n\nThen, a_{k+1} = a_k *n/(k+1).\n\nFor k <n-1, this ratio is greater than 1, so the terms increase. At k =n-1, the ratio is n/n=1, so a_n =a_{n-1}. For k >=n, the ratio is less than 1, so terms decrease.\n\nThus, the terms up to k=n are the largest, and the terms from k=n onwards decrease.\n\nSo, the sum S(n) includes the two largest terms (k=n-1 and k=n), and the tail R(n) starts from k=n+1.\n\nBut even knowing this, how to compare S(n) and R(n)?\n\nMaybe consider pairing terms in S(n) and R(n).\n\nFor example, compare term k=n -m in S(n) and term k=n +m +1 in R(n).\n\nBut without symmetry, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, use induction. Suppose that for some n, S(n) ≈ R(n). But induction seems not helpful here.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by the central limit theorem but without explicitly using it.\n\nThe sum S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! is similar to the sum of terms in the expansion of e^n, but truncated at k=n.\n\nIf we can relate this truncation to some symmetry property, perhaps.\n\nConsider that for large n, the terms around k=n are symmetric in some sense. For example, the term at k=n +t and k=n -t might relate in a way that their contributions cancel or sum to a certain value.\n\nBut for the Poisson distribution, which is not symmetric, this might not hold. However, for large n, the Poisson distribution approximates a normal distribution which is symmetric around its mean. So, the sum up to k=n would be approximately the same as the sum from k=n onwards.\n\nBut this is again probability-based.\n\nAlternatively, use generating functions. Let's consider the generating function for S(n):\n\nG(x) = sum_{k=0}^n x^k /k!.\n\nThen, G(n) = S(n). We need to find the asymptotic behavior of G(n)/e^n.\n\nBut I don't know how to analyze this without advanced methods.\n\nWait, another idea: Use the fact that e^{-n} S(n) is the probability that a Binomial(n, p) random variable is less than or equal to n, when p approaches 1. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following identity:\n\nsum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = e^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + error term.\n\nBut we need to justify this.\n\nAnother approach: Use the reflection formula or some combinatorial identity.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing the sum S(n) as follows:\n\nS(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{k=0}^n (n)^k /k!.\n\nLet’s compare this to the expansion of e^{n} which is the sum to infinity. If we can find an expression that relates the partial sum to the total sum in a symmetric way.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that e^{n} can be written as the sum of S(n) and R(n), and due to some symmetry or property, these two sums are approximately equal for large n.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, consider the following substitution. Let’s write k =n -m in S(n):\n\nS(n) = sum_{m=0}^n n^{n -m}/( (n -m)! ) = n^n sum_{m=0}^n 1/(n^m (n -m)! ).\n\nSimilarly, R(n) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty n^{n +m}/( (n +m)! ).\n\nBut this doesn't seem to help.\n\nWait, let's consider the ratio of successive terms in R(n):\n\nFor m >=1, term_{m} = n^{n +m}/ ( (n +m)! ).\n\nThe ratio term_{m+1}/term_{m} = n / (n +m +1).\n\nThis is similar to a hypergeometric series, but I don't know how to sum it.\n\nAlternatively, notice that as m increases, the ratio decreases, so the terms in R(n) decrease faster than a geometric series with ratio n/(n+1). Therefore, the tail sum R(n) is bounded by the first term times a geometric series.\n\nThe first term of R(n) is n^{n+1}/( (n+1)! ).\n\nThen, R(n) < n^{n+1}/( (n+1)! ) * sum_{m=0}^\\infty [n/(n+2)]^m.\n\nThe sum is a geometric series with ratio r =n/(n+2), which converges to 1/(1 -n/(n+2)) = (n+2)/2.\n\nTherefore, R(n) < n^{n+1}/( (n+1)! ) * (n+2)/2.\n\nBut n^{n+1}/(n+1)! = n^{n+1}/( (n+1) n! ) = n^n /n! * n / (n+1).\n\nIf we denote C(n) = n^n /n!, then R(n) < C(n) * n/(n+1) * (n+2)/2 ≈ C(n) * (n/2).\n\nBut C(n) = n^n /n! ≈ e^n /sqrt(2 pi n) by Stirling's. So R(n) < (e^n /sqrt(2 pi n)) * (n/2) = e^n / (2 sqrt(2 pi /n )).\n\nBut this seems to suggest that R(n) grows as e^n * sqrt(n), which contradicts the fact that R(n) = e^n - S(n). This approach must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps the bounding is too loose. The first term of R(n) is n^{n+1}/(n+1)! = n^n /n! * n/(n+1) ≈ e^n /sqrt(2 pi n) * n/(n+1) ≈ e^n /sqrt(2 pi n).\n\nThen, R(n) < e^n /sqrt(2 pi n) * (n+2)/2 ≈ e^n /sqrt(2 pi n) * n/2 ≈ e^n / (2 sqrt(2 pi /n )).\n\nBut this still suggests R(n) grows, which is impossible since R(n) = e^n - S(n) and S(n) is approaching e^n. Therefore, this bounding method is not useful.\n\nPerhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me revisit the original problem. The user wants to use basic limit properties, definition of e^x, binomial expansion, logarithms, etc.\n\nHere's a possible approach using the definition of e^x and the binomial theorem.\n\nConsider that e^n = lim_{m→∞} (1 + n/m)^m.\n\nBut how does this relate to the sum S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!?\n\nPerhaps expand (1 + 1/m)^{m n} and compare to the sum S(n).\n\nWait, (1 + n/m)^m = sum_{k=0}^m C(m,k) (n/m)^k.\n\nAs m approaches infinity, this tends to e^n.\n\nBut the sum S(n) is sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nIf we set m =n, then (1 + n/m)^m = (1 +1)^n = 2^n, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, set m= something else.\n\nWait, perhaps use the identity that (1 + x/n)^n approaches e^x as n approaches infinity. If we can relate this to the sum S(n).\n\nAlternatively, consider the difference between (1 +1)^n and the sum S(n). But (1 +1)^n = sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) which is different from sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nAlternatively, consider the generating function for the sum S(n). The generating function is sum_{k=0}^n (n t)^k /k!.\n\nBut evaluating this at t=1 gives S(n). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = e^n \\cdot P(X ≤n), where X is a Poisson(n) random variable. But since we can't use Poisson, this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the Chernoff bound. For a Poisson random variable X with λ=n, P(X ≤n) = e^{-n} sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nChernoff bound states that P(X ≤n) = P(X ≤ (1 - δ) μ) where μ=n and δ=0. But Chernoff bound gives this probability as approximately 1/2 for δ=0, which is the case here. But this uses probability concepts, which is not allowed.\n\nBut maybe this suggests that the limit is 1/2 due to symmetry around the mean for large n. But again, this is probability.\n\nGiven that the problem has been solved many times using Poisson or integrals, but the user wants a basic method, perhaps there is a clever substitution or identity that can be used.\n\nLet me think about using the binomial expansion in a clever way.\n\nConsider the product of e^{-n} and sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nThis is the same as sum_{k=0}^n (n^k e^{-n})/k!.\n\nPerhaps relate this to the binomial coefficients.\n\nWait, consider that n^k/k! = C(n,k) * k! /k! * n^k / C(n,k) = C(n,k) * n^k / (n(n-1)...(n -k +1)).\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! = sum_{k=0}^n C(n,k) (n^{k} /k! - something). Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Use the fact that for large n, the sum sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! is approximately half of e^n. If we can write e^n = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k! + sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty n^k/k! and argue that both sums are approximately equal for large n.\n\nBut how to show that without advanced methods?\n\nPerhaps use parity or symmetry. For example, if n is even, split the sum into two parts. But not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, consider writing e^n as the sum from k=0 to infinity of n^k/k! and note that for large n, the terms around k=n are symmetric in some sense. If the distribution of terms is symmetric around k=n, then the sum up to k=n would be half of the total. But this is only approximately true for large n.\n\nBut how to formalize this?\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution k =n -t and k =n +t and compare the terms.\n\nFor k =n -t, term_{n-t} =n^{n -t}/( (n -t)!).\n\nFor k =n +t, term_{n +t} =n^{n +t}/( (n +t)!).\n\nWhat's the ratio term_{n +t}/term_{n -t}?\n\n= [n^{n +t}/( (n +t)! )] / [n^{n -t}/( (n -t)! )] =n^{2t} * (n -t)! / (n +t)!.\n\nThis is n^{2t} / [ (n +t)(n +t -1)...(n -t +1) ].\n\nFor fixed t and large n, the denominator is approximately n^{2t} * (1 + O(t^2/n)).\n\nThus, the ratio is approximately 1 / (1 + O(t^2/n)) ≈ 1 - O(t^2/n).\n\nTherefore, for large n and fixed t, term_{n +t} ≈ term_{n -t} * [1 - O(t^2/n)].\n\nThus, the terms are approximately equal for small t, but for larger t, the terms decay faster on the right side.\n\nThis suggests that the sum S(n) is slightly larger than the tail R(n), but as n increases, the difference becomes negligible, and both sums approach e^n /2.\n\nBut how to turn this into a rigorous proof?\n\nPerhaps use the squeeze theorem. For any ε >0, show that for sufficiently large n, the sum S(n) is between (1/2 - ε)e^n and (1/2 + ε)e^n.\n\nBut how to establish these bounds?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum S(n) = e^n - R(n). If we can show that R(n) ≈ S(n), then e^n ≈ 2S(n), so S(n) ≈ e^n /2.\n\nBut to show R(n) ≈ S(n), consider that the terms in R(n) are roughly the same as the terms in S(n) but mirrored around k=n. But due to the asymmetry in the terms, this is not exactly true. However, for large n, the decay on both sides might balance out.\n\nBut without a precise argument, this remains heuristic.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the user's constraints, I think the key insight is to recognize that the sum up to n and the tail from n+1 are asymptotically equal, each approaching half of e^n. This is based on the distribution of terms around k=n being symmetric in the limit, leading to the partial sums splitting the total sum equally.\n\nHowever, to make this rigorous without advanced methods, I might need to look for a different approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the lecture materials mentioned. Use the definition of e^x as the limit of (1 + x/m)^m as m→∞.\n\nConsider the following expression:\n\n(1 + 1/m)^{m n}.\n\nAs m approaches infinity, this approaches e^n.\n\nExpand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n(1 + 1/m)^{m n} = sum_{k=0}^{m n} C(m n, k) (1/m)^k.\n\nNow, C(m n, k) = (m n)! / (k! (m n -k)!).\n\nSo, the term is (m n)! / (k! (m n -k)! m^k).\n\nFor large m, we can approximate (m n)! / (m n -k)! ≈ (m n)^k.\n\nThus, C(m n, k) (1/m)^k ≈ (m n)^k /k! m^k = n^k /k!.\n\nTherefore, the binomial expansion approximates sum_{k=0}^{m n} n^k /k!.\n\nBut as m approaches infinity, the binomial expansion approaches e^n, and the sum approaches sum_{k=0}^\\infty n^k/k! =e^n.\n\nBut the partial sum up to k=n is S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nBut how does the binomial expansion up to k=m n relate to S(n)?\n\nIf we set m=1, then (1 +1/n)^{n^2} ≈ e^n, but the binomial expansion up to k=n^2 is sum_{k=0}^{n^2} C(n^2, k) (1/n)^k.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, set m=n. Then, (1 +1/n)^{n^2} = [ (1 +1/n)^n ]^n ≈ e^n.\n\nExpanding this using the binomial theorem gives sum_{k=0}^{n^2} C(n^2, k) (1/n)^k.\n\nBut again, the terms C(n^2, k) (1/n)^k ≈ n^{2k} /k! /n^k =n^k /k!.\n\nThus, the sum approximates sum_{k=0}^{n^2} n^k/k! ≈ e^n.\n\nBut this seems similar to the original sum S(n), but up to k=n^2.\n\nBut in the limit as n→∞, the binomial expansion sum up to k=n^2 approaches e^n, while our S(n) is up to k=n.\n\nBut the terms beyond k=n are negligible? Not sure.\n\nThis line of reasoning doesn't directly help.\n\nPerhaps another approach: Use the generating function for the partial sums.\n\nConsider generating function G(x) = sum_{k=0}^n x^k/k!.\n\nThen, we are interested in G(n)/e^n.\n\nBut how to analyze this?\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio G(n)/e^n = e^{-n} sum_{k=0}^n n^k/k!.\n\nTake the logarithm: ln(G(n)) -n.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the ratio test for the terms. The ratio of the next term to the current term in S(n) is n/(k+1). For k <n-1, this ratio is >1, and for k >=n, it's <1.\n\nBut how to use this?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck and the user mentioned that the problem can be solved with basic methods, I'll try to think of a different angle.\n\nConsider writing e^{-n} S(n) = sum_{k=0}^n e^{-n} n^k/k!.\n\nLet's make a substitution k =n -t, where t ranges from 0 to n.\n\nThen, e^{-n} S(n) = sum_{t=0}^n e^{-n} n^{n -t}/( (n -t)! ).\n\n= sum_{t=0}^n e^{-n} n^{n} n^{-t} / ( (n -t)! )\n\n= n^n e^{-n} sum_{t=0}^n 1/(n^t (n -t)! ).\n\nNow, notice that n! = n(n-1)...(n -t +1)(n -t)!.\n\nThus, (n -t)! =n! / [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)].\n\nTherefore, 1/(n -t)! = [n(n-1)...(n -t +1)]/n!.\n\nSu",
