    "Content": "The question is based on the following exercise in real analysis: Assume that $A,B\\subset{\\Bbb R}$ are both bounded and $x>0$ for all $x\\in A\\cup B$. Show that $$\n\\sup(AB)=\\sup A\\sup B\n$$\n  where \n  $$\nAB:=\\{ab\\in{\\Bbb R}:a\\in A, b\\in B\\}.\n$$ Since $0<a\\leq\\sup A$ and $0<b\\leq\\sup B$ for all $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$, we have\n$$\nab\\leq\\sup A\\sup B\n$$\nfor all $ab\\in AB$ which implies that $\\sup AB\\leq\\sup A\\sup B$. I have trouble with another direction:\n$$\n\\sup AB\\geq\\sup A\\sup B\n$$\nI was trying to show that for every $\\epsilon >0$, $\\sup AB-\\epsilon \\geq \\sup A\\sup B$. If one uses the definition of supremum, one has the estimates that for every $\\epsilon>0$,\n$$\n\\sup A-\\epsilon\\leq a, \\quad \\sup B-\\epsilon\\leq b\n$$\nfor some $a\\in A,\\ b\\in B$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the problem the user presented. The task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format, listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is about showing that the supremum of the product set AB is greater than or equal to the product of the suprema of A and B, given that A and B are subsets of positive real numbers and are bounded. The user also mentions they're stuck on proving the reverse inequality after establishing that sup(AB) ≤ sup A sup B.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem example, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem's assumption was only that n is an integer. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me check again. The original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But that wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But the formatted example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might be part of a different problem. Hmm, perhaps the example given is from a different problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example says: Original problem is to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that would make the formatted problem's assumptions more restrictive than the original. But that's incorrect because the original problem's assumption is for every integer n, not just those divisible by 7. So perhaps the example is wrong. But maybe the user intended to show that in the formatted problem, they might have miswritten. But maybe I should proceed with the current problem regardless.\n\nBack to the current problem. The question is about subsets A and B of real numbers, both bounded, and all elements in A∪B are positive. The problem is to show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B. The user is stuck on proving sup(AB) ≥ sup A sup B.\n\nSo the original problem's assumptions are: A and B are subsets of real numbers, both are bounded, and every element in A∪B is positive (x > 0 for all x in A∪B). The problem is to show sup(AB) = sup A sup B.\n\nSo, following the example, each assumption should be listed line by line. Each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo first, the assumptions:\n\n1. A is a subset of real numbers.\n2. B is a subset of real numbers.\n3. A is bounded.\n4. B is bounded.\n5. For all x in A∪B, x > 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one condition. However, maybe the problem states that A and B are both bounded and their elements are positive. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- A and B are subsets of ℝ.\n- A is bounded.\n- B is bounded.\n- For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"A is a subset of ℝ\" is one assumption. \"B is a subset of ℝ\" is another. Then \"A is bounded\", \"B is bounded\", and \"For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0\". Wait, but in the original problem, it's stated that A and B are both bounded and their union consists of positive elements. So maybe each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining \"A and B are subsets of ℝ\" into one line? But according to the example, each assumption should address only one object. So in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. So perhaps here, each subset condition is separate. Wait, but \"A is a subset of ℝ\" and \"B is a subset of ℝ\" are two separate assumptions. Similarly, \"A is bounded\" and \"B is bounded\" are two. Then the last one is about all x in A∪B being positive. That seems correct.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a subset of ℝ.\n- B is a subset of ℝ.\n- A is bounded.\n- B is bounded.\n- For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"A,B⊂ℝ\" and \"both bounded\" and \"x>0 for all x∈A∪B\". So each of these should be separate.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem was that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example lists two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect because the original problem doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. Therefore, there's a mistake in the example. But the user probably intended that the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem.\n\nSo applying that here, the problem states:\n\nAssume that A,B⊂ℝ are both bounded and x>0 for all x∈A∪B. Show that sup(AB)=sup A sup B.\n\nThus, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a subset of ℝ.\n- B is a subset of ℝ.\n- A is bounded.\n- B is bounded.\n- For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. The problem is to show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B.\n\nBut in the example, the user split \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't have the divisibility condition. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But for the current problem, we have to follow the instructions: list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions would be as above. However, maybe the problem states that A and B are subsets of ℝ and both bounded, so maybe \"A and B are subsets of ℝ\" could be one assumption, but according to the example, each assumption should address one object. So in the example, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they split it into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps each condition on the same object is split. Therefore, here, A and B are different objects, so each gets their own line.\n\nWait, the problem says \"A,B⊂ℝ\" so that's two subsets, so each is a subset of ℝ. But maybe in the problem's context, they are both subsets of ℝ, so perhaps \"A and B are subsets of ℝ\" as one assumption. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"A is a subset of ℝ\" and \"B is a subset of ℝ\" would be separate. But in the example, they had two separate conditions on the same object (n being an integer and n divisible by 7). So perhaps each condition, even on the same object, is a separate line. Here, the objects are A and B, so each condition on them would be separate.\n\nSo, the assumptions:\n\n- A is a subset of ℝ.\n- B is a subset of ℝ.\n- A is bounded.\n- B is bounded.\n- All elements of A are positive.\n- All elements of B are positive.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\", which includes both A and B. So maybe that's a single assumption: For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0. But in the example, they split conditions on the same object. So here, it's a single condition on the union of A and B. So perhaps that's one assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to split into \"All elements of A are positive\" and \"All elements of B are positive\", but the problem states \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\", which is equivalent to both A and B being subsets of positive reals. So that's two separate conditions, but they could be combined. However, according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"All elements of A are positive\" is one condition on A, and \"All elements of B are positive\" is another condition on B. So that would be two assumptions. But the problem states \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\", which is a single condition covering both. But since the user's example splits conditions on the same object (n being integer and divisible by 7), perhaps here we can split into two conditions: A is a subset of positive reals and B is a subset of positive reals. Because that's equivalent to A ∪ B being positive.\n\nBut the original problem states \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\". So in terms of assumptions, that's a single condition. However, the instruction says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. The \"one object\" here could be A ∪ B, but that's a set. Alternatively, it's about the elements of A and B. But perhaps it's better to state it as one assumption: All elements in A ∪ B are positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into two: All elements in A are positive, and All elements in B are positive. That would make two separate assumptions, each applying to one object (A and B respectively).\n\nI think given the example provided, where the user split the conditions on the same object (n being integer and n divisible by 7), here splitting into two assumptions about A and B each being positive might be appropriate. However, the original problem states the condition on A ∪ B. So perhaps the correct approach is to list:\n\n- For all x ∈ A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nBut the example shows that if a condition applies to multiple objects, it's still stated as a single assumption. Wait, in the example, \"n is an integer\" applies to n, and \"n is divisible by 7\" also applies to n. So two separate conditions on the same object. In our case, the condition applies to all elements in A ∪ B. But A ∪ B is a union of two objects. However, according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps the \"one object\" here is each element x in A ∪ B. But that's not an object; the objects are A and B. So maybe it's better to split into two assumptions:\n\n- For all a ∈ A, a > 0.\n- For all b ∈ B, b > 0.\n\nThis way, each assumption applies to one object (A and B respectively). That would align with the example's approach. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a subset of ℝ.\n- B is a subset of ℝ.\n- A is bounded.\n- B is bounded.\n- For all a ∈ A, a > 0.\n- For all b ∈ B, b > 0.\n\nBut the original problem states \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\", which is equivalent to the two separate conditions. So splitting into two is acceptable. Therefore, that would be six assumptions. However, perhaps in the original problem, it's stated as a single condition on A ∪ B. But following the example's style, where conditions on the same variable are split, here conditions on different sets are split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's original wording is \"x > 0 for all x ∈ A ∪ B\", so that's a single condition. Therefore, the assumption is:\n\n- For all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should apply to one object. Here, A ∪ B is a set, so the assumption is about that set. However, the instruction says \"applied to one object\". If \"A ∪ B\" is considered as one object, then the assumption is about that. But perhaps it's better to follow the problem's original wording. The problem states: \"A,B⊂ℝ are both bounded and x>0 for all x∈A∪B\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a subset of ℝ.\n2. B is a subset of ℝ.\n3. A is bounded.\n4. B is bounded.\n5. For all x ∈ A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. This seems correct. Now, the problem is to show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B.\n\nBut the user's problem in the Math Stack Exchange question is specifically about showing the inequality sup(AB) ≥ sup A sup B. However, the original problem as stated in the question is to show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B. The user has managed to show sup(AB) ≤ sup A sup B but is stuck on the reverse inequality. However, when structuring the problem according to the format, we should present the original problem as stated, not the user's specific difficulty. So the problem to state is \"Show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B\", even though the user's question is about the specific direction.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as listed and the problem statement as per the original exercise.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a subset of ℝ,\nB is a subset of ℝ,\nA is bounded,\nB is bounded,\nFor all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\n\nProblem:\nShow that sup(AB) = sup A sup B, where AB = {ab ∈ ℝ : a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\n\nBut checking the example again, in the example the problem was written as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So the problem starts with a verb. The current problem's original statement is \"Show that sup(AB) = sup A sup B.\" So following that, the problem should start with \"Show that...\".\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA is a subset of ℝ,\nB is a subset of ℝ,\nA is bounded,\nB is bounded,\nFor all x in A ∪ B, x > 0.\nProblem:\nShow that $$\\sup(AB) = \\sup A \\sup B$$ where $$AB = \\{ab \\in \\mathbb{R} : a \\in A, b \\in B\\}$$.\n###",
