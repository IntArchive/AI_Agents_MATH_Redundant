    "Content": "Among many fascinating sides of mathematics, there is one that I praise, especially for didactic purposes : the parallels that can be drawn between some \"Continuous\" and  \"Discrete\" concepts. I am looking for examples bringing a help to a global understanding... Disclaimer : Being driven, as said above, mainly by didactic purposes, I am not in need for  full rigor here although I do not deny at all the interest of having a rigorous approach in other contexts where it can be essential to show in particular in which sense the continuous \"object\" is the limit of its discrete counterparts. I should appreciate if some colleagues can give examples of their own, in the style \"my favorite one is...\", or references to works about this theme. Let me provide, on my side, five examples : 1st example: How to obtain the equations of certain epicycloids, here a nephroid : Consider a $N$ -sided regular polygon $A_1,A_2,\\cdots A_N$ with any integer $N$ large enough, say around $50$ . Let us connect every point $A_k$ to point $A_{3k}$ by a line segment (we assume a cyclic numbering). As can be seen on Fig. 1, a certain envelope curve is \"suggested\". Question : which (smooth) curve is behind this construction ? Answer : Let us consider two consecutive line segments like those represented on Fig. 1 with a larger width : the evolution speed of $A_{3k} \\to A_{3k'}$ where $k'=k+1$ is three times the evolution speed of $A_{k} \\to A_{k'}$ , the pivoting of the line segment takes place at the point (of the line segment) which is 3 times closer to $A_k$ than to $A_{3k}$ (the weights' ratio 3:1 comes from the size ratio of ''homothetic'' triangles $P_kA_kA_k'$ and $P_kA_{3k}A_{3k'}$ .) Said in an algebraic way : $$P_k=\\tfrac{3}{4}e^{ika}+\\tfrac{1}{4}e^{3ika}$$ ( $A_k$ is identified with $e^{ika}$ with $a:=\\tfrac{2 \\pi}{N}$ ). Replacing now discrete values $ka$ by a continuous parameter $t$ , we get $$z=\\tfrac{3}{4}e^{it}+\\tfrac{1}{4}e^{3it}$$ i.e., a parametric representation of the nephroid, or the equivalent real equations : $$\\begin{cases}x=\\tfrac{3}{4}\\cos(t)+\\tfrac{1}{4}\\cos(3t)\\\\\ny=\\tfrac{3}{4}\\sin(t)+\\tfrac{1}{4}\\sin(3t)\\end{cases}$$ Fig. 1 : The nephroid as an envelope. It can be viewed as the trajectory of a point of a small circle with radius $\\dfrac14$ rolling inside a circle with radius $1$ . Remark: if, instead of connecting $A_k$ to $A_{3k}$ , we had connected it to $A_{2k}$ , we would have obtained a cardioid, with $A_{4k}$ an astroid, etc. 2nd example: Coupling ''second derivative $ \\ \\leftrightarrow  \\ \\min \\ $ kernel'' : All functions considered here are at least $C^2$ , but function $K$ . Let $f:[0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and $K:[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ (a so-called \"kernel\") defined by $K(x,y):=\\min(x,y)$ . Let us associate $f$ with function $\\varphi(f)=g$ defined by $$\\tag{1}g(y)=\\int_{t=0}^{t=1} K(t,y)f(t)dt=\\int_{t=0}^{t=1} \\min(t,y)f(t)dt$$ We can get rid of \" $\\min$ \" function by decomposing the integral into : $$\\tag{2}g(y)=\\int_{t=0}^{t=y} t f(t)dt+\\int_{t=y}^{t=1} y f(t)dt$$ $$\\tag{3}g(y)=\\int_{t=0}^{t=y} t f(t)dt - y F(y)$$ where we have set $$\\tag{4}F(y):=\\int_{t=1}^{t=y}f(t)dt \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{Remark:} \\ \\ \\ F'(y)=f(y)$$ Let us differentiate (4) twice : $$\\tag{5}g'(y)=y f(y) - 1 F(y) - y f(y) = -F(y)$$ $$\\tag{6}g''(y)= -f(y)  \\ \\ \\Longleftrightarrow \\ \\ f(y)=-g''(y)$$ Said otherwise, the inverse of transform $f \\rightarrow \\varphi(f)=g$ is: $$\\tag{7}\\varphi^{-1} = \\text{opposite of the second derivative.}$$ This connexion with the second derivative is rather unexpected... Had we taken a discrete approach, what would have been found ? The discrete equivalents of $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi^{-1}$ are matrices : $$\\bf{M}=\\begin{pmatrix}1&1&1&\\cdots&\\cdots&1\\\\1&2&2&\\cdot&\\cdots&2\\\\1&2&3&\\cdots&\\cdots&3\\\\\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots\\\\\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots&\\cdots\\\\1&2&3&\\cdots&\\cdots&n\n\\end{pmatrix} \\ \\ \\textbf{and}$$ $$\\bf{D}=\\begin{pmatrix}2&-1&&&&\\\\-1&2&-1&&&\\\\&-1&2&-1&&\\\\&&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\\\&&&-1&2&-1\\\\&&&&-1&1\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ that verify matrix identity: $\\bf{M}^{-1}=\\bf{D}$ in analogy with (7). Indeed, Nothing to say about the connection of matrix $\\bf{M}$ with coefficients $\\bf{M}_{i,j}=min(i,j)$ with operator $K$ . tridiagonal matrix $\\bf{D}$ is well known (in particular by all people doing discretization) to be \"the\" discrete analog of the second derivative due to the classical approximation: $$f''(x)\\approx\\dfrac{1}{2h^2}(f(x-h)-2f(x)+f(x+h))$$ that can easily be obtained using Taylor expansions. The exceptional value $1$ at the bottom right of $\\bf{D}$ is explained by discrete boundary conditions. Remark: this correspondence between \"min\" operator and second derivative is not mine ; I known for a long time but  I am unable to trace back where I saw it at first (hopefully in a signal processing book). If somebody has a reference ? Connected : the eigenvalues of $D$ are remarkable ( http://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/~amen/2005/040903-7.pdf ) In the same vein : computation of adjoint operators . 3rd example : the Itô integral. One could think that the Lebesgue integral (1902) is the ultimate theory of integration, correcting the imperfections of the theory elaborated by Riemann some 50 years before. This is not the case. In particular, Itô has defined (1942) a new kind of integral which is now essential in probability and finance. Its principle, roughly said, is that infinitesimal \"deterministic\" increments \"dt\" are replaced by random increments of brownian motion type \"dW\" as formalized by Einstein (1905), then by Wiener (1923). Let us give an image of it. Let us first recall definitions of brownian motion $W(t)$ or $W_t$ , ( $W$ for Wiener), an informal one, and a formal one: Informal : A \"particle\" starting at $x=0$ at time $t$ , jumps \"at the next instant\" $t+dt$ , to a nearby position; either on the left or on the right, the amplitude and sign of the jump being governed by a normal distribution $N(x,\\sigma^2)$ with an infinitesimal fixed standard deviation $\\sigma.$ $\\text{Formal}: \\ \\ W_t:=G_0 t+\\sqrt{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}G_n\\dfrac{\\sin(\\pi n t)}{\\pi n}$ , with $G_n$ iid $N(0,1)$ random variables. (Other definitions exist. This one, under the form of a \"random Fourier series\" is handy for many computations). Let us now consider one of the fundamental formulas of Itô's integral, for a continuously differentiable function $f$ : $$\\tag{8}\\begin{equation}\n\\displaystyle\\int_0^t f(W(s))dW(s) = \\displaystyle\\int_0^{W(t)} f(\\lambda)d \\lambda - \\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\int_0^t f'(W(s))ds.\n\\end{equation}$$ Remark: The integral sign on the LHS of (8) defines Itô's integral, whereas the integrals on the RHS have to be understood in the sense of Riemann/Lebesgue. The presence of the second term on the RHS is rather puzzling, isnt'it ? Question: how can be understood/justified this second integral ? Szabados has proposed (1990) (see ( https://mathoverflow.net/questions/16163/discrete-version-of-itos-lemma )) a discrete analog of formula (8). Here is how it runs: Theorem: Let $f:\\mathbb{Z} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ . let us define : $$\n\\tag{9}\\begin{equation}\nF(k)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\dfrac{1}{2}f(0)+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} f(j)+\\dfrac{1}{2}f(k) & if & k \\geq 1 & \\ \\ (a)\\\\\n0  & if & k = 0 & \\ \\ (b)\\\\\n-\\dfrac{1}{2}f(k)-\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=k+1}^{-1} f(j)-\\dfrac{1}{2}f(0)  & if & k \\leq -1 & \\ \\ (c)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right.\n\\end{equation}\n$$ Remarks: We will work only on (a) and its particular case (b). (a) is nothing else than the \"trapezoid formula\" explaining in particular factors $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ in front of $f(0)$ et $f(k)$ . Let us now define a family of Random Variables $X_k$ , $k=1, 2, \\cdots $ , iid on $\\{-1,1\\}$ with $P(X_k=-1)=P(X_k=1)=\\frac{1}{2}$ , and let $$\n\\begin{equation}\nS_n= \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^n X_k. \n\\end{equation}\n$$ Then $$\n\\tag{10}\\begin{equation}\n\\forall n, \\ \\ \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{n}f(S_i)X_{i+1} = F(S_{n+1})-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\dfrac{f(S_{i+1})-f(S_{i})}{X_{i+1}}\n\\end{equation}\n$$ Remark : Please note analogies : between $\\frac{f(S_{i+1})-f(S_{i})}{X_{i+1}}$ and $f'(S_i)$ . between $F(k)$ and $\\displaystyle\\int_{\\lambda=0}^{\\lambda=k}f(\\lambda)d\\lambda$ . For example, a) If $f$ is identity function ( $\\forall k \\  f(k)=k$ ), definition (9)(a) gives : $$\n\\begin{equation}\nF(k)=\\frac{1}{2}(k-1)k+\\frac{1}{2}k=\\dfrac{1}{2}k^2.\n\\tag{11}\n\\end{equation}\n$$ which doesn't come as a surprise : the 'discrete antiderivative' of $k$ is $\\frac{1}{2}k^2$ ... (the formula in (11) remains in fact the same for $k<0$ ). b) If $f$ is the \"squaring function\" ( $\\forall k, \\ f(k)=k^2$ ), (9)(a) becomes : $$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{If} \\  k>0, \\ \\ \\  F(k)=\\frac{1}{6}(k-1)k(2k-1)+\\frac{1}{2}k^2=\\dfrac{1}{3}k^3+\\dfrac{1}{6}k.\n\\tag{12}\n\\end{equation}\n$$ This time, a new term $\\dfrac{1}{6}k$ has entered into the play. Proof of the Theorem: The definition allows to write : \\begin{equation}F(S_{i+1})-F(S_i)=f(S_i)X_{i+1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\dfrac{f(S_{i+1})-f(S_i)}{X_{i+1}}\n\\tag{13}\n\\end{equation} In fact, proving (11) can be split into two cases: either $X_{i+1}=1$ , or $X_{i+1}=-1$ . Let us consider the first case (the second case is similar): the RHS of (13) becomes $f(S_i)+\\frac{1}{2}(f(S_{i+1})-f(S_i))=\\frac{1}{2}(f(S_{i+1})+f(S_i))$ which is the area variation in the trapezoid formula ; Summing all equations in (10) gives the desired identity. An example of application : Let $f(t)=t$ ; we get $$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=0}^{n}S_iX_{i+1} = F(S_{n+1})-\\frac{n}{2}=\\dfrac{1}{2}S_{n+1}^2-\\frac{n}{2}.$$ which appears as the discrete equivalent of the celebrated formula: $$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\displaystyle\\int_0^t W(s)dW(s) = \\frac{1}{2}W(t)^2-\\frac{1}{2}t.\n\\end{equation}\n$$ One can establish the autocorrelation of $W_t$ process is $$cov(W_s,W_t)=E(W_sW_t)-E(W_s)E(W_t)=\\min(s,t),$$ (see ( Autocorrelation of a Wiener Process proof )) providing an unexpected connection with the second example... Last remark : Another kind of integral based on a discrete definition : the gauge integral ( https://math.vanderbilt.edu/schectex/ccc/gauge/ ). 4th example (Darboux sums) : Here is a discrete formula : $$\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\\sin\\frac{k \\pi}{n} = \\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$$ (see a proof in Prove that $\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\\sin\\frac{k \\pi}{n} = \\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}$ ) Has this formula a continuous \"counterpart\" ? Taking the logarithm on both sides, and dividing by $n$ , we get : $$\\tfrac1n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln \\sin \\tfrac{k \\pi}{n}=\\tfrac{\\ln(n)}{n}-\\ln(2)\\tfrac{n-1}{n}$$ Letting now $n \\to \\infty$ , we obtain the rather classical integral : $$\\int_0^1 \\ln(\\sin(\\pi x))dx=-\\ln(2)$$ 5th example : bivariate cdfs (cumulative probability density functions). Let $(X,Y)$ a pair of Random Variables with pdf $f_{X,Y}$ and cdf : $$F_{X,Y}(x,y):=P(X \\leq x \\ \\& \\ Y \\leq y).$$ Take a look at this formula : $$P(x_1<X \\leq x_2, \\ \\ y_1<Y \\leq y_2)=F_{XY}(x_2,y_2)-F_{XY}(x_1,y_2)-F_{XY}(x_2,y_1)+F_{XY}(x_1,y_1)\\tag{14}$$ ( https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter5/5_2_2_joint_cdf.php ) It is the discrete equivalent of the continuous definition of $F_{XY}$ as the mixed second order partial derivative of $F_{X,Y}$ , under the assumption that $F$ is a $C^2$ function : $$f_{XY}(x,y)=\\dfrac{\\partial^2 F_{X,Y}}{\\partial x \\partial y}(x,y).\\tag{15}$$ Do you see why ? Hint : make $x_2 \\to x_1$ and make $y_2 \\to y_1$ and assimilate the LHS of (14) with $f(x_1,y_1)dxdy$ . Final remarks : A remarkable text about this analogy in Physics : https://www.lptmc.jussieu.fr/user/lesne/MSCS-Lesne.pdf In linear algebra, continuous analogs of some fundamental factorizations ( https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.2014.0585 ). A similar question on MathOverflow mentionning in particular the following well written book \"Computing the continuous discretely\" by  by Beck and Robins. There are many other tracks, e.g., connections with graphs \"Discrete and continuous : two sides of the same.\" by L. Lovàsz or this one ( http://jimhuang.org/CDNDSP.pdf ), discrete vs. continuous versions of the logistic equation ( https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3328867 ), etc. In the epidemiology domain: \"Discrete versus continuous-time models of malaria infections\" lecture notes by Lucy Crooks, ETH Zürich . Another example in probability: the connection between a discrete and a continuous distribution, i.e., the Poisson( $\\lambda$ ) distribution and the $\\Gamma(n)$ distribution which is well treated in [this answer] ( https://math.stackexchange.com/q/2228023 ).",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I like the following problem: Decompose a positive integer $N$ into positive integer addends summing to $N$ with maximal product. In the \"discrete\" version of this problem, you find that the answer is almost to use all $3$ s; but, not every positive integer is a sum of $3$ s, so you might need some $2$ s to finish it off. Unsurprisingly, then, the \"continuous\" analog of a problem solved discretely by mostly- $3$ s-with-a-few- $2$ s involves $e$ . The benefit of $3$ over $2$ is easy to see by decomposing $6$ , for which $3 \\cdot 3 = 9 > 8 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2$ . For a couple of references to this particular problem, see: Krause, E. F.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange according to their specified structure. The original question is about examples of discrete and continuous complementary approaches in mathematics. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the given question and extract a specific problem from it. The question on Math Stack Exchange has several examples, but the user wants each example to be structured into assumptions and the problem. Let me look through the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the 1st example: It talks about obtaining the equations of a nephroid by connecting points on a regular polygon and then moving to a continuous parameter. The problem here is to find which smooth curve is the envelope of the line segments connecting A_k to A_{3k}. The answer involves parametrizing the curve using a continuous parameter t instead of discrete k.\n\nThe assumptions would include things like the polygon being N-sided with N large enough, connecting A_k to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering, etc. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property.\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition on a single object. For the 1st example here, the assumptions might be:\n\n- A regular N-sided polygon A_1, A_2, ..., A_N is considered.\n- N is a sufficiently large integer (e.g., around 50).\n- Each point A_k is connected to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n- The envelope of these line segments suggests a smooth curve.\n\nThen the problem is to determine which smooth curve this envelope represents.\n\nWait, but the original example answer gives the parametric equations. So maybe the problem as posed in the example is to derive the parametric equations starting from the discrete polygon connections. The answer replaces discrete k with continuous t. So the problem is to show that the envelope is the nephroid given by those parametric equations.\n\nBut in the user's example, they extracted a problem where the assumption was that n is an integer divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. Here, the assumptions would be the setup for the problem. So for the first example in the Stack Exchange question, the formatted problem would list the assumptions about the polygon, the connections, etc., and the problem is to find the smooth curve (nephroid) as the envelope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to derive the parametric equations given the discrete setup. The user's example had a problem to prove something, so here the problem could be to prove that the envelope is the given parametric equations.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions and the problem statement. The example given by the user included assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a single condition. So for each example in the Stack Exchange question, I need to extract the key conditions and structure the problem.\n\nLooking at the 1st example:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Regular N-sided polygon with N sufficiently large (around 50).\n- Each point A_k is connected to A_{3k} (cyclic numbering).\n- The envelope of these segments suggests a smooth curve.\n\nProblem: Determine the smooth curve represented by this envelope.\n\nBut the answer involves parametrizing with continuous t. The key step is replacing ka with a continuous parameter t. So maybe the problem is to show that the envelope's parametric equations are the given ones.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to derive the parametric equations of the envelope from the discrete construction.\n\nBut the original question is asking for examples of discrete/continuous parallels. So perhaps the problem is to connect the discrete construction (polygon with lines) to the continuous curve (nephroid). The problem statement would be to prove that the envelope is the nephroid as parametrized by the given equations.\n\nSo assumptions would be:\n\n- Consider a regular N-sided polygon with N sufficiently large.\n- Connect each vertex A_k to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n- The envelope of these lines forms a smooth curve.\n\nProblem: Show that the envelope is the nephroid parametrized by z = (3/4)e^{it} + (1/4)e^{3it}.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumptions were two separate lines: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So for this problem, each assumption should be a separate line.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon A_1, A_2, ..., A_N is considered.\n\nAssumption: N is a sufficiently large integer (e.g., around 50).\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n\nProblem: Prove that the envelope of the connecting line segments is the nephroid parameterized by z = (3/4)e^{it} + (1/4)e^{3it}.\n\nBut the original problem in the example didn't include all steps, just the problem statement. Wait, the user's example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: Assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in that case, the assumptions included n being an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91. The original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7 as a condition, but perhaps the answer needed that? Wait, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user intended to show that if n is divisible by 7, then A(n) is divisible by 91. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So maybe the example has an error. But regardless, the user's example format is:\n\nAssumption: list each condition line by line.\n\nProblem: the actual question.\n\nSo applying this to the first example in the Stack Exchange question:\n\nOriginal problem description in the example: connecting points on a polygon to get an envelope, then moving to continuous parameter. The problem is to find which curve it is. The answer replaces discrete k with continuous t.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list assumptions about the polygon, the connections, and then the problem is to show the envelope is the nephroid.\n\nBut how to structure that? Let me see:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon with vertices A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.\n\nAssumption: N is a sufficiently large integer (e.g., N ≈ 50).\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n\nProblem: Prove that the envelope of the connecting line segments is the nephroid parameterized by z(t) = (3/4)e^{it} + (1/4)e^{3it}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key assumptions are the polygon and the connection rule, and the problem is to derive the parametric equations. The user's example included mathematical expressions in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that when replacing the discrete parameter ka with continuous t, the resulting parametric equations describe the nephroid.\n\nBut in the original example, the problem was phrased as a question: \"which (smooth) curve is behind this construction?\" So the problem is to determine the curve.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon A_1, A_2, ..., A_N with large N.\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} via line segments.\n\nAssumption: The envelope of these segments suggests a smooth curve.\n\nProblem: Determine the smooth curve represented by this envelope.\n\nBut the answer involves deriving the parametric equations. So the problem is to show that the envelope is the nephroid given by those equations.\n\nAlternatively, to derive the parametric equations starting from the discrete polygon connections.\n\nBut the original example in the user's instruction had the problem statement as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to find which curve is the envelope, with the answer being the parametric equations. So perhaps the problem is to derive those equations.\n\nAlternatively, since the question in the Stack Exchange example is presented as a question (\"which smooth curve is behind this construction?\"), the formatted problem should be that question, with the assumptions being the setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon A_1, A_2, ..., A_N is considered with N sufficiently large.\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n\nProblem: Determine the smooth curve formed by the envelope of these connecting line segments.\n\nBut the answer is the nephroid's parametric equations, so the problem is to prove or show that the envelope is that curve.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants the problem structured exactly like their example, which had mathematical expressions in the problem statement, then perhaps the problem is to prove that the parametric equations are as given.\n\nBut the original problem in the example was a \"Prove that...\" whereas here it's a \"determine which curve...\". Since the user's example transformed the original problem (which was to prove divisibility by 91 for all integers n) into a problem with an added assumption (n divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions are the conditions of the problem, and the problem is to find the curve.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to pick one of the examples from the Stack Exchange question and format it as per the user's example. The user's example had a mathematical expression in the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the second example: Coupling second derivative and min kernel. The problem there is to show the connection between the integral transform with kernel K(t,y) = min(t,y) and the second derivative. The discrete analog involves matrices M and D.\n\nBut the problem as posed is more about showing the inverse of the integral operator is the second derivative. The assumptions would be functions f and K, the integral transform, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for the second example:\n\nAssumption: Functions f and g are related by g(y) = ∫₀¹ min(t,y) f(t) dt.\n\nAssumption: f is at least C².\n\nProblem: Show that f(y) = -g''(y).\n\nBut the original problem in the example is about the connection between the integral transform and the second derivative. The problem statement in the example is the derivation leading to f = -g''.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be to prove that the inverse of the integral operator defined by the kernel min(t,y) is the negative second derivative.\n\nBut following the user's example, the problem would be phrased as \"Prove that f(y) = -g''(y)\" with assumptions on f, g, and K.\n\nAnother example is the 3rd one about Itô's integral. The problem there is to understand the second term in the formula (8), which is justified via the discrete analog. The problem could be to prove the discrete version of Itô's formula (equation 10). The assumptions would involve the definition of F(k), the random variables X_k, etc.\n\nHowever, the user's instruction says to pick one problem from the Math Stack Exchange question and format it. Since the user's example was about divisibility, but the given question is about multiple examples, the user might want each example formatted. But since the user provided one example, perhaps they want each example in the original question formatted similarly. But given the length, maybe just pick one. But the user's instruction says to read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filter unrelated information, and structure the problem as per the format. The entire question is about examples, but each example is a separate problem. So perhaps each example should be formatted separately. However, the user's example only had one problem. The original post has five examples. Maybe the user wants all formatted, but given the length, perhaps focus on one.\n\nThe user's example had:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\n\nAssumption: n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user added an assumption that wasn't there (n divisible by 7). The original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem in the example might have a mistake. But regardless, following the user's example, we need to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nLooking at the first example in the Stack Exchange question:\n\nThe construction is:\n\n- N-sided regular polygon, N large (~50).\n\n- Connect A_k to A_{3k} with line segments.\n\n- The envelope is a smooth curve.\n\nProblem: What's the curve?\n\nAnswer: Nephroid parameterized by z(t) = 3/4 e^{it} + 1/4 e^{3it}.\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon is considered.\n\nAssumption: N is a sufficiently large integer (e.g., N ≈ 50).\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} with cyclic numbering.\n\nProblem: Prove that the envelope of the connecting line segments is the nephroid parameterized by z(t) = (3/4)e^{it} + (1/4)e^{3it}.\n\nBut the original problem in the example didn't have \"prove\" but rather \"which curve is behind this construction\". However, following the user's example which transformed the original problem into a \"prove\" statement with added assumptions, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be: Determine the smooth curve formed by the envelope of the line segments connecting A_k to A_{3k} in a regular N-gon as N approaches infinity.\n\nBut since the user's example uses \"Prove that...\", maybe we need to phrase it as a proof problem. However, the original example in the Stack Exchange question is more about finding the curve, not proving a divisibility. So perhaps the problem is to show or derive the parametric equations.\n\nGiven the user's example included the mathematical expression in the problem statement, the formatted problem here would include the parametric equations as what needs to be proven.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem for the first example would be:\n\nAssumption: A regular N-sided polygon A_1, A_2, ..., A_N is considered.\n\nAssumption: N is a sufficiently large integer.\n\nAssumption: Each vertex A_k is connected to A_{3k} via line segments with cyclic numbering.\n\nProblem: Prove that the envelope of these line segments is the nephroid given by $$z(t) = \\tfrac{3}{4}e^{it} + \\tfrac{1}{4}e^{3it}$$ for continuous parameter \\( t \\).\n\nThis follows the structure where each assumption is a single line, and the problem is to prove the envelope is the specified curve.",
