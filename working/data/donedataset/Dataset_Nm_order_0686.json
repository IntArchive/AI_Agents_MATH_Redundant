    "Content": "Prove that $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac1{x^x}\\, dx<2.$$ Note: This inequality is rather tight. The integral approximates to $1.9955$ . Integration by parts is out of the question. If we let $f(x)=\\dfrac1{x^x}$ and $g'(x)=1$ then $f'(x)=-x^{-x}(\\ln x + 1)$ by implicit differentiation and $g(x)=x$ . The integral $\\int f'(x)g(x)\\, dx$ looks even harder to evaluate. Expressing the left-hand side as a Frullani integral $$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{f(ax)-f(bx)}x\\, dx=(f(0)-f(\\infty))\\ln\\frac ba$$ means that $f(ax)-f(bx)=x^{1-x}$ . However, I can't seem to find a continuous function $f$ that satisfies the functional equation. Is there such a function? (For context, user371838's post below proves sophomore's dream which I also asked about originally.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Remarks : Here is an alternative proof.\nI used the same bounds for this question Improper integral inequality including the golden ratio and the Sophomore's dream We will use the following auxiliary results (Facts 1-2). Fact 1 : $x^{-x} \\le \\frac{3 - x}{x^2 - x + 2}$ for all $x \\in [1, 2]$ . (RHS is the Pade $(1, 2)$ approximation of $x^{-x}$ at $x = 1$ .) Fact 2 : $x^{-x} \\le a^{-x} \\mathrm{e}^{-x + a}$ for all $x, a > 0$ . ( Proof : Taking logarithm on both sides, letting $u = \\frac{a}{x} > 0$ ,\nit is equivalent to $\\ln u \\le u - 1$ which is true (easy).) We have (Sophomore's dream) $$I_1 := \\int_0^1 x^{-x} \\mathrm{d} x\n= \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(n + 1)^{n + 1}}\n\\le 1 + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\sum_{n=3}^\\infty \\frac{1}{4^{n + 1}} = \\frac{2233}{1728}.$$ Using Fact 1, we have $$I_2 := \\int_1^2 x^{-x}\\mathrm{d} x\n\\le \\int_1^2 \\frac{3 - x}{x^2 - x + 2}\\mathrm{d} x = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt 7}\\arctan \\frac{\\sqrt 7}{5} - \\frac12\\ln 2.$$ Using Fact 2, we have $$I_3 := \\int_2^{5/2} x^{-x}\\,\\mathrm{d} x\n\\le \\int_2^{5/2} 2^{-x}\\mathrm{e}^{-x + 2}\\,\\mathrm{d} x = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2\\mathrm{e}^{-1}}}{8 + 8\\ln 2},$$ and $$I_4 :=\n \\int_{5/2}^3 x^{-x}\\,\\mathrm{d} x\n\\le \\int_{5/2}^3 (5/2)^{-x}\\mathrm{e}^{-x + 5/2}\\,\\mathrm{d} x = \\frac{4\\sqrt{10} - 8\\sqrt{\\mathrm{e}^{-1}}}{125\\ln \\frac{5}{2} + 125}, $$ and $$I_5 := \n\\int_3^\\infty x^{-x}\\, \\mathrm{d} x\n\\le \\int_3^\\infty 3^{-x} \\mathrm{e}^{-x + 3}\\, \\mathrm{d} x = \\frac{1}{27\\ln 3 + 27}.$$ Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\n\t&\\int_0^\\infty x^{-x} \\mathrm{d} x\\\\\n\t=\\, & I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4 + I_5\\\\\n\t\\le\\,& \\frac{2233}{1728} \n\t+ \\frac{5}{\\sqrt 7}\\arctan \\frac{\\sqrt 7}{5} - \\frac12\\ln 2\n\t+ \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2\\mathrm{e}^{-1}}}{8 + 8\\ln 2} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{10} - 8\\sqrt{\\mathrm{e}^{-1}}}{125\\ln \\frac{5}{2} + 125}\n\t+ \\frac{1}{27\\ln 3 + 27}\\\\\n\t<\\,& 2.\n\\end{align*} We are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question according to the given format. The user wants me to list each assumption line by line, addressing only one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, the original problem is to prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(x^x) dx is less than 2. The user mentions that the integral is approximately 1.9955, so the inequality is tight. They tried integration by parts but found it not helpful. They also considered Frullani integrals but couldn't find a suitable function.\n\nNow, looking at the example provided: in that case, assumptions included that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But wait, in the original example problem, the user had to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, they included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that might not be accurate. Wait, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Wait, no, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would actually change the problem. Maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nBut in the current problem, the integral from 0 to infinity of 1/x^x dx < 2. The assumptions here would be any conditions given or required. The problem statement doesn't have explicit assumptions like variables being integers or certain divisibility. But maybe implicit assumptions. The function 1/x^x is defined for x > 0, except at x=0 where it's the limit as x approaches 0 from the right. The integral is from 0 to infinity. So maybe the assumptions are about the convergence of the integral, or properties of the function. But according to the user's example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem again: Prove that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2. The integral involves x from 0 to infinity. The function 1/x^x is equivalent to e^(-x ln x). The integral's convergence is probably an assumption, but the problem is to prove the inequality. The user mentions that integration by parts is out of the question, and they tried Frullani integrals without success. But the problem statement itself doesn't have explicit assumptions except the integral's existence.\n\nWait, the example given by the user had an original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but perhaps the user intended to show how to filter out unrelated info. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it by adding the divisibility by 7? But no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which would restrict the problem. That seems conflicting. Maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nFor the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity of 1/x^x dx < 2. The assumptions here might be that the function 1/x^x is integrable over [0, ∞), which is true because the integral converges. But perhaps that's not necessary to list as an assumption because the problem is to prove the inequality, not to verify convergence. The user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and then the formatted problem added another assumption, but maybe that was a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the user corrected it by adding an assumption. But in the given example, the formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should only be \"n is an integer\". Adding \"n is divisible by 7\" changes the problem. So maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem as per the user's format.\n\nSo for the current problem: Prove that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nPossible assumptions here could be:\n\n1. The function 1/x^x is defined for x > 0.\n2. The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n3. The integral converges.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx converges.\n- The function 1/x^x is continuous on (0, ∞).\n\nBut does the problem state these, or are they implicit? The problem just states to prove the integral is less than 2. The user mentions that the integral approximates to 1.9955, so convergence is given. The problem doesn't require proving convergence, just the inequality. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx exists (i.e., converges).\n- The value of the integral is a real number.\n\nBut maybe the user doesn't need to list these as assumptions because the problem is to prove the inequality, assuming the integral exists. However, according to the example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the integral is convergent, so we can talk about its value. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state any assumptions; it just asks to prove the inequality. So maybe in this case, there are no explicit assumptions other than the integral being considered. However, according to the user's format, we need to list assumptions. If there are no explicit assumptions, perhaps the only assumption is the domain of integration and the function's definition.\n\nWait, the function 1/x^x is equal to e^(-x ln x). For x > 0, this is defined. At x=0, the limit as x approaches 0+ is 1, since x^x approaches 1. At x approaching infinity, x^x grows very rapidly, so 1/x^x approaches 0. So the integral from 0 to infinity is of a function that starts at 1, decreases, and approaches 0. The integral converges because, for example, near 0, the function behaves like 1, and from 1 to infinity, 1/x^x decays faster than exponential. So the integral is finite, which is a necessary condition for the problem. But the problem statement doesn't mention proving convergence; it just asks to show it's less than 2.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only assumption needed is that the integral exists (converges), so we can assign it a real number value. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem doesn't require stating the convergence as an assumption because it's part of the problem's context, then maybe there are no assumptions. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So following that, here the assumption would be that the integral is over [0, ∞), and the function is 1/x^x.\n\nBut according to the user's example, each assumption is a single line, one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f(x) = 1/x^x is integrable over [0, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into more assumptions, but I don't see other conditions. The problem is straightforward: prove this integral is less than 2. The user tried some methods but they didn't work. The answer probably involves estimating the integral by splitting it into intervals where the function can be bounded above by something integrable whose integral sums to less than 2.\n\nBut according to the user's format, list each assumption line by line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx is convergent.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nAlternatively, since the function is defined piecewise or has certain properties, but I don't think so. The example had two assumptions, but maybe here only one. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a real number in the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut that's part of the integral's definition. Hmm. The user's example took \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is part of the original problem's statement. Here, the original problem is to prove the inequality for the integral as stated, so the assumptions are inherent in the integral's definition. But according to the example, we should list them explicitly. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integration variable x ranges over [0, ∞).\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example listed \"n is an integer\" because the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Here, the problem is about an integral, so the assumptions would relate to the integral's properties. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f(x) = 1/x^x is defined for all x > 0.\n\nBut again, that's inherent. Alternatively, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement, so the formatted problem would have no assumptions? But the example shows that even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, following that, here the assumption would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ 1/x^x dx < 2.\n\nThat seems most appropriate. Because the problem is to show the integral is less than 2, assuming it exists (which is necessary to talk about its value).
