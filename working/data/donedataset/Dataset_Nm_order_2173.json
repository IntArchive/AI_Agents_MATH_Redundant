    "AcceptedAnswer": "Is the following \"integral free\" enough? Let $$h:\\quad \\Omega\\to{\\mathbb R}\\ ,\\qquad (x,y)\\mapsto h(x,y)$$ be the given harmonic function which we assume to be $C^2$. Using $h$ we define the function\n$$f(x,y):= h_x(x,y)- i\\ h_y(x,y)$$\nwith real part $u(x,y)=h_x(x,y)$ and imaginary part $v(x,y)=- h_y(x,y)$. As $h$ is harmonic one has $u_x\\equiv v_y$, furthermore $u_y\\equiv -v_x$ by equality of the mixed derivatives. So $f\\colon \\Omega\\to{\\mathbb C}$ is $C^1$ and satisfies the CR equations; therefore it is an analytic function of $z=x+iy\\in\\Omega$. Assume that $\\Omega$ is simply connected and chose a point $z_0\\in\\Omega$. Then by a standard theorem of complex analysis the function\n$$F(z)\\ :=\\ h(z_0)+\\int_\\gamma f(z)\\ dz\\ , \\qquad \\hbox{$\\gamma\\ $    a path from $z_0$ to $z$}\\ ,$$\nis an analytic primitive of $f$ in $\\Omega$. Let $(x,y)\\mapsto U(x,y)$ be the real part of $F$. Then by the CR equations, this time applied to $F$, we have\n$$U_x(z) -i U_y(z)=F'(z)=f(z)= h_x(z)-i h_y(z)\\qquad(z\\in\\Omega)\\ .$$\nIt follows that $$\\nabla U(x,y)\\equiv\\nabla h(x,y)\\qquad \\bigl( (x,y)\\in\\Omega\\bigr)\\ ,$$\nand as $U(x_0,y_0)=h(x_0,y_0)$ we conclude that in fact $U(x,y)\\equiv h(x,y)$ in $\\Omega$. Note that we had to assume $\\Omega$ simply connected. The function $h(x,y):=\\log\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is harmonic in the punctured plane but is not the real part of an analytic function in this domain.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function.\" The question asks if there's a way to show this without using integration equations, allowing later theorems. \n\nNow, I need to filter out unrelated information. The original problem is about harmonic functions being real parts of holomorphic functions. The user wants to know if this can be proven without integration, possibly using other theorems. \n\nIn the example, the assumptions were about the properties of the variable involved. Here, the main assumption is that we have a harmonic function. The problem is to prove it's the real part of a holomorphic function. But the question also specifies not using integration equations and allowing later theorems. Wait, but in the format provided, assumptions are about the problem's conditions, not the methods used. So maybe the method (like not using integration) isn't an assumption but part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the example: the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, they listed n is an integer and then n is divisible by 7 as two separate assumptions. So each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nIn this case, the main assumption is that we have a harmonic function. So the assumption here is \"u is a harmonic function.\" But the problem is to show that u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem, not the method of proof. The method constraints (like not using integration) are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. So the problem part should include the condition \"without using integration equations\" and \"allowing later theorems.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would just be that u is harmonic. The problem is to prove u is the real part of a holomorphic function under the given method constraints.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nu is a harmonic function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, allowing the use of later theorems.\n\nWait, but the original question is phrased as a question: \"Is there a way to show that every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations if later theorems are allowed also?\"\n\nSo maybe the problem is to ask whether such a proof exists under those method constraints, rather than to directly prove it. But the example given was a directive to prove something. The user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example was \"Prove that...\".\n\nHmm. The original problem is phrased as a question asking if a certain proof method exists. However, the example the user provided was a problem that says \"Prove that...\". So perhaps the user wants the problem part to be the actual statement to prove, regardless of the original question's phrasing. \n\nWait, looking at the example again: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". So the user wants the problem part to be the actual mathematical statement to prove. \n\nIn this case, the original question is asking if there's a way to show X without Y. But perhaps the core problem is to show X, with the constraints on the method. However, in the example, the assumption included conditions on the variables, not on the method. The method (like not using integration) would be part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption. \n\nSo the problem statement here would be: \"Prove that every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, if later theorems are allowed.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem should just be the mathematical statement, and the constraints on the method are part of the problem's conditions. However, in academic problems, the method constraints are often part of the problem. For example, \"Prove X without using Y theorem.\"\n\nSo in this case, the problem is: \"Prove that every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations.\" The \"allowing later theorems\" might be a permission to use other theorems, so maybe it's part of the problem's conditions.\n\nBut how to structure that? In the example, the problem was stated as \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" The assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the mathematical statement is \"Every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function.\" The additional constraints are on the method: \"without using integration equations\" and \"allowing later theorems.\"\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- u is a harmonic function.\n\nProblem: Prove that u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, assuming later theorems are allowed.\n\nAlternatively, since the original question is phrased as a question (\"Is there a way...\"), maybe the problem should be phrased as a question. But in the example, the problem was a directive (\"Prove that...\").\n\nThe user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example was a directive. So even if the original question is phrased as a yes/no question, the formatted problem should be a statement to prove, with the constraints included.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are that u is harmonic. The problem is to prove u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, with permission to use later theorems.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"without using integration equations if later theorems are allowed also.\" So maybe the problem is to show the existence of such a proof method, given that later theorems can be used. However, the example's problem was a straightforward \"prove that...\".\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. But following the example's structure, where the problem was a direct statement to prove, perhaps the formatted problem here would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that every harmonic function is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, given that later theorems are allowed.\n\nBut the original question is asking whether such a method exists, not to actually do the proof. However, the user's example converted the original problem into a \"Prove that...\" statement. So maybe the user wants the problem part to be the core mathematical claim, and the method constraints are part of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nu is a harmonic function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, allowing the use of later theorems.\n\nAlternatively, if \"every harmonic function\" is considered, maybe the assumption is that u is any harmonic function, and the problem is to show it's the real part of some holomorphic function under the method constraints.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the assumption is that u is a harmonic function (since the problem states \"every harmonic function\"), and the problem is to prove that u is the real part of a holomorphic function with the given method restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nu is a harmonic function.\nProblem:\nProve that u is the real part of a holomorphic function without using integration equations, allowing the use of later theorems.\n###",
