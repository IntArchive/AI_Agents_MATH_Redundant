    "Content": "This is an unproven proposition I've come across in multiple places. Suppose $A$ is a commutative Noetherian ring, and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $A$. Then $S^{-1}A$ is Noetherian. Why is this? I thought about taking some chain of submodules\n$$\nS^{-1}M_1\\subset S^{-1}M_2\\subset\\cdots\n$$\nand pulling back to a chain \n$$\nM_1\\subset M_2\\subset\\cdots\n$$\nof submodules of $A$ which must eventually stablize. Is there more to it than this? I kind of wary of assuming all submodules of $S^{-1}A$ have form $S^{-1}M$ for $M\\leq A$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a standard property of localizations: Theorem. Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $S\\neq\\emptyset$ be a multiplicative subset. Let $M$ be an $R$ -module. Let $\\varphi\\colon R\\to S^{-1}R$ be the canonical map ( $\\varphi(r) = \\frac{rs}{s}$ ), and likewise, by abuse of notation, let $\\varphi\\colon M\\to S^{-1}M$ be the natural map $(\\varphi(m) = \\frac{sm}{s}$ with $s\\in S$ ). For every submodule $N$ of $M$ , $S^{-1}N = \\{\\frac{a}{s}\\mid a\\in N\\}$ is a submodule of $S^{-1}M$ . If $L$ is a submodule of $S^{-1}M$ , then $\\varphi^{-1}(L) = \\{m\\in M\\mid \\varphi(m)\\in L\\}$ is a submodule of $M$ . If $N$ is a submodule of $M$ , then $N\\subseteq \\varphi^{-1}(S^{-1}N)$ . Moreover, if $N=\\varphi^{-1}(L)$ for some submodule $L$ of $S^{-1}M$ , then $L=S^{-1}N$ . Proof. $S^{-1}N$ is nonempty, as it contains $\\frac{0}{s}$ ; it is closed under differences, since $\\frac{a}{s}-\\frac{b}{t} = \\frac{ta-sb}{st}\\in S^{-1}N$ if $a,b\\in N$ . And it is closed under scalar multiplication, since $a\\in N$ implies $ra\\in N$ for all $r\\in R$ , so $\\frac{r}{t}(\\frac{a}{s}) = \\frac{ra}{ts}\\in S^{-1}N$ if $a\\in N$ . Now let $L$ be a submodule of $S^{-1}M$ ; since $\\varphi$ is a module homomorphism, the pullback of a submodule is a submodule, so 2 is immediate. Again, let $N$ be a submodule of $M$ . Then for every $a\\in N$ we have $\\varphi(a) = \\frac{sa}{s}\\in S^{-1}N$ , since $sa\\in N$ , hence $a\\in \\varphi^{-1}(S^{-1}N)$ . Now assume that $N=\\varphi^{-1}(L)$ . If $a\\in N$ and $s\\in S$ , then $\\frac{a}{s} = \\frac{ssa}{sss} = \\frac{s}{ss}\\frac{sa}{s} =\\frac{s}{ss}\\varphi(a)\\in L$ (since $\\varphi(a)\\in L$ ), hence $S^{-1}N\\subseteq L$ . Conversely, let $\\frac{m}{t}\\in L$ . Then $\\frac{tt}{t}\\frac{m}{t} = \\frac{(tt)m}{tt}=\\varphi(m)\\in L$ , hence $m\\in \\varphi^{-1}(L) = N$ ; thus, $\\frac{m}{t}\\in S^{-1}N$ , proving that $L\\subseteq S^{-1}N$ . Therefore, $L=S^{-1}N$ , as claimed. $\\Box$ Corollary. Every submodule of $S^{-1}M$ is of the form $S^{-1}N$ for some submodule $N$ of $M$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Why is the localization of a commutative Noetherian ring still Noetherian?\" and the user is asking about a proposition they've encountered. The problem states that if A is a commutative Noetherian ring and S is a multiplicative subset of A, then the localization S⁻¹A is Noetherian. They mention trying to pull back a chain of submodules from S⁻¹A to A and stabilizing, but are concerned about assuming all submodules of S⁻¹A have the form S⁻¹M for M a submodule of A.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. A is a commutative Noetherian ring. That's one assumption.\n2. S is a multiplicative subset of A. That's another assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove that S⁻¹A is Noetherian. The user's approach involves chains of submodules, but they're unsure if all submodules of the localization come from submodules of A. So the problem statement is essentially the proposition they mentioned.\n\nNow, checking the example provided in the original query. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nApplying the same structure here. The assumptions are about the ring A being commutative and Noetherian, and S being a multiplicative subset. So each assumption should be a separate line, addressing one property each.\n\nProblem: Prove that S⁻¹A is Noetherian.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions included conditions on the object (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are on the ring A and the subset S. So each of those properties is separate. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a commutative Noetherian ring,\nS is a multiplicative subset of A.\n\nProblem:\nProve that S⁻¹A is Noetherian.\n\nThat seems to fit. The user's question is about why this proposition holds, given those assumptions. The example had two assumptions, each on one object (n) with different conditions. Similarly here, the two assumptions are on different objects (A and S), each with their own properties.\n\nThe user's confusion is about whether all submodules of S⁻¹A are of the form S⁻¹M. But for the purpose of structuring the problem, we just need to list the assumptions and the problem statement. The user's doubts are part of their thought process but not part of the structured problem. So the formatted problem should just have the assumptions as given in the proposition and the problem to prove the localization is Noetherian.",
