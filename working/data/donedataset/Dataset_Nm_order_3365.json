    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the question according to the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully and extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving the convergence of the integral of the absolute value of the sinc function. The title is \"How to prove absolute summability of sinc function?\" and the question mentions that they already know the integrals of (sin x / x)^2 and sin x / x from 0 to infinity both equal π/2. Now they want to show that the integral of the absolute value |sin x / x| dx from 0 to infinity converges.\n\nSo, according to the example provided, I need to list all the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nFirst, let's identify the assumptions. The problem states two known integrals: the integral of (sin x / x)^2 and the integral of sin x / x, both over 0 to infinity, equal to π/2. Wait, but actually, the integral of sin x / x from 0 to infinity is π/2, but the integral of (sin x / x)^2 is also π/2? Let me confirm. Actually, the integral of (sin x / x)^2 from 0 to infinity is π/2, and the integral of sin x / x from 0 to infinity is also π/2. So these are two separate results provided in the problem statement. However, the user wants to prove the convergence of the integral of |sin x / x| dx from 0 to infinity.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"We know that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 dx=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\, dx=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$$ How do I show that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\left\\vert\\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\right\\vert \\, dx$$ converges?\"\n\nWait, actually, the integral of (sin x / x)^2 is π/2, and the integral of sin x / x is π/2 as well. But that's not correct. Wait, actually, the integral of sin x / x from 0 to infinity is π/2, that's correct. But the integral of (sin x / x)^2 from 0 to infinity is π/2 as well? Let me check. Hmm, no, actually, the integral of (sin x / x)^2 dx from 0 to infinity is π/2. Yes, because integrating (sin x)^2 / x^2 dx from 0 to infinity can be evaluated using integration by parts, and it results in π/2. So that's correct. So the problem states these two integrals equal π/2, but the actual problem is to show that the integral of |sin x / x| dx converges.\n\nNow, in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem provides known results which might be considered as given assumptions. However, the user's task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem.\n\nWait, the example given had the original problem where the user mentioned \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't mention the divisibility by 7. Wait, looking back, the example given was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example had a typo or mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, following the instructions, the task is to list all assumptions from the problem, each being one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user states two known results: the integrals of (sin x /x)^2 and sin x /x both equal π/2. But how do these relate to the problem of showing convergence of the integral of |sin x /x| dx? Perhaps these are given as known, but maybe they are just context. The problem is to show convergence of the absolute integral. So, in the formatted problem, should these known integrals be listed as assumptions? Or are they just part of the problem statement?\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That seems like an error in the example. Maybe the example is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the user intended that the assumptions are the given conditions in the problem, not additional ones. Wait, but in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption is that n is an integer, and perhaps another assumption was added mistakenly. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Maybe the user provided an incorrect example. Regardless, the instruction is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions listed line by line.\n\nIn the current problem, the known integrals are given, but the actual problem is to show the convergence of ∫|sin x /x| dx from 0 to ∞. So perhaps the assumptions are that the integrals of (sin x /x)^2 and sin x /x are known to be π/2, but how does that relate to the problem? Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require these as assumptions but just mentions them as context. However, the user wants to structure the problem by listing the assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the original problem. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote:\n\n\"We know that ∫0^∞ (sinx/x)^2 dx = ∫0^∞ sinx/x dx = π/2. How do I show that ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx converges?\"\n\nWait, the first integral is of (sinx/x)^2, which equals π/2, and the second integral is of sinx/x, which also equals π/2. But actually, the integral of sinx/x from 0 to ∞ is π/2, but the integral of (sinx/x)^2 is also π/2. That's correct. However, these are just known results provided in the problem statement. The actual problem is to show that the integral of |sinx/x| converges. So, the problem is to show convergence, and the known results are given as context. But in terms of assumptions, maybe the problem is asking under the assumption that these integrals are known, but perhaps they are not directly related. Alternatively, maybe these are just part of the problem statement and not assumptions.\n\nHowever, according to the example, even if the original problem states something as a given condition, it's listed as an assumption. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then, in the example, there was an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been part of the problem's actual conditions but perhaps wasn't stated clearly. Wait, maybe the original example had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but the user mistyped. Anyway, the point is, for the current problem, the known integrals are given, but they are not assumptions for the problem. The problem is to prove convergence of ∫|sinx/x| dx, and the given integrals are perhaps just context or possibly used in the solution, but not assumptions. Therefore, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions here other than the function involved and the interval of integration.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the integral converges. The integral is from 0 to infinity of |sinx/x| dx. So the assumptions would be about the function and the interval. But in the problem statement, there's no additional condition given. The user just states the problem after mentioning two known integrals. So perhaps the only assumption is that we're dealing with the function |sinx/x| on [0, ∞), and the problem is to show the integral converges. But according to the example, assumptions are listed as properties applied to one object. In this case, maybe:\n\nAssumption: The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\nAssumption: The integrand is |sin x / x|.\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the standard ones for such integrals, but in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\", which was given in the original problem. So here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function considered is |sin x / x|.\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n\nBut since these are part of the problem statement, not separate assumptions. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which was part of the problem's original statement. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumption is that x is a real variable, and the integral is in the Lebesgue sense or improper Riemann integral. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we don't need to list those as assumptions. Alternatively, the problem is to prove convergence of the improper Riemann integral of |sinx/x| from 0 to ∞. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is an improper Riemann integral.\n- The integrand is |sinx/x|.\n- The limits of integration are from 0 to ∞.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables and their properties. Hmm. Maybe in this problem, there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. The problem is to show that ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx converges. So the only assumption is that the integral is over [0, ∞) and the integrand is |sinx/x|. But these are part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps in this case, there are no additional assumptions beyond the problem's setup. So maybe the formatted problem should have no assumptions listed, but according to the example, perhaps the problem's inherent conditions are considered assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty, but the example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", that becomes an assumption. Therefore, here, the problem is about the integral of |sinx/x| from 0 to ∞, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is |sinx/x|.\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, the problem might have an implicit assumption that the integral is an improper Riemann integral, which is standard unless stated otherwise. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫0^∞ |(sin x)/x| dx is an improper Riemann integral.\n\nBut this seems too technical. Alternatively, since the problem is to show convergence, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral is considered over the positive real line. However, following the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integrand is |sin x / x|.\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nBut since the problem directly states these, perhaps they are part of the problem, not assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which becomes an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then there's an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Maybe the user intended that the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem's statement was mistyped. Regardless, following the user's instruction to filter unrelated information and structure the problem with assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question mentions two known integrals, but those are not assumptions for the problem to show convergence of the absolute integral. They are just given as context. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- The function sin x / x is considered.\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut the problem is about the absolute value, so maybe:\n\n- The integrand is the absolute value of sin x / x.\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n\nBut again, these are part of the problem statement. The example seems to take conditions from the problem statement and list them as assumptions. So following that approach, here the problem is to show that ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx converges, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integrand is |sinx/x|.\n- The integral is from 0 to ∞.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the integral is improper at both 0 and infinity, which is true. The integral ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx has potential issues at x=0 and as x approaches infinity. At x=0, sinx/x ~ 1, so the integrand ~1, which is integrable, but the integral from 1 to infinity of |sinx/x| dx is the main concern for convergence. So maybe the assumption is that the integral is split into two parts: from 0 to 1 and 1 to infinity. But the problem doesn't state that, so perhaps we shouldn't list that as an assumption.\n\nGiven the example provided, even if it's possibly incorrect, the instructions are to list the assumptions line by line from the problem. In the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but it was added as an assumption. That suggests that perhaps the user expects to extract implicit assumptions or correct the problem's conditions. But that might be a mistake in the example. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the problem's given conditions as assumptions. However, in the current problem, the user provides two known integrals, but the actual problem is to show the convergence of another integral. So the known integrals might not be assumptions but just provided context. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the problem as is, without additional assumptions beyond what's necessary. But according to the example, even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", that's listed as an assumption. So here, the problem is to show that the integral converges, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx.\n\nBut that's the problem itself. I think there's confusion here because the example provided might not be accurate. However, following the example's structure, even if the original problem states something as a condition, it's listed as an assumption. So in this case, the problem is to show the convergence, and the assumptions would include the properties given in the problem. But the two known integrals are given as known results, not as assumptions for the current problem. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should have no assumptions listed, but according to the example, maybe we need to include the integral's properties. This is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's definition. Therefore, the assumptions section could be empty, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions are that the integral is an improper Riemann integral, which is standard. But since the example includes assumptions from the problem statement, perhaps here the assumptions are:\n\n- The integrand is |sin x / x|.\n- The integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut these are part of the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should list the problem as is, with the assumptions being the integral's setup. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. Here, there's no variable; the problem is about an integral. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫0^∞ |sin x / x| dx is considered.\n\nBut that's redundant. I think the user's example may have had an error, but based on the instructions, I need to extract assumptions from the problem. The original problem states two known integrals, but those are not assumptions for the current problem. The current problem is to show convergence of ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx. So the assumptions would be related to the integrand and the interval. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity.\nThe integrand is the absolute value of (sin x)/x.\n\nProblem:\nShow that ∫0^∞ |(sin x)/x| dx converges.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as properties of the variable, but here it's about the integral's properties. However, following the structure, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ |(sin x)/x| dx is considered.\nThe integrand |(sin x)/x| is being integrated over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut again, this seems redundant. Alternatively, the problem itself is the integral's convergence, so perhaps there are no separate assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions, but the example requires listing assumptions. This is conflicting.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example's structure, even if it's flawed. In the example, the original problem's condition \"for every integer n\" became an assumption \"n is an integer\". Then an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\" was added, which wasn't in the original problem. This suggests that perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, or the original problem was different. Given that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are simply the conditions given in the problem statement. However, the problem statement here doesn't have any conditions except the integral to be evaluated. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function (sin x)/x is considered.\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞).\n\nBut these are part of the problem. Alternatively, since the problem is to show convergence, the assumptions might be that the integral is improper at both 0 and infinity. But again, this is inherent in the problem's setup.\n\nGiven that the example might have been incorrect, and to adhere to the user's instructions, I'll proceed to format the problem by extracting the necessary assumptions from the problem statement. Since the problem is to show convergence of ∫0^∞ |sinx/x| dx, and there are no explicit conditions given beyond the integral itself, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integrand is |sin x / x|.\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each addressing one property. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integrand is the absolute value of $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$,\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval $[0, \\infty)$.\nProblem: \nShow that $$\\int_0^\\infty \\left\\vert \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\right\\vert \\, dx$$ converges.\n###",
