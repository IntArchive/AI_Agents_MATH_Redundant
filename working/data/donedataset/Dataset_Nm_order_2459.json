    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The integral given is from 0 to 1 of 1 divided by (x - 2) times the fifth root of x squared times (1 - x) cubed, dx. The answer is supposed to be this complicated expression involving 2 to the 11/10 power, pi over the square root of 5 plus root 5. \n\nFirst, the integrand looks pretty messy. The denominator has (x - 2) which is negative over the interval [0,1] since x is between 0 and 1, so x - 2 is always negative. Then there's this fifth root of x squared times (1 - x) cubed. Maybe I can rewrite that as x^(2/5) times (1 - x)^(3/5). That might make it a bit clearer. So the integrand is 1 / [ (x - 2) * x^(2/5) * (1 - x)^(3/5) ] dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThe user mentioned that substitutions like x -> 1 - x, 1/x, sqrt(x), etc., don't seem to help. They also mentioned hypergeometric functions and gamma functions, so maybe this integral relates to the beta function or something similar. The bounds from 0 to 1 are typical for beta functions, which are related to gamma functions. The beta function is B(a,b) = integral from 0 to 1 of t^(a-1)(1 - t)^(b-1) dt. But here, we have an extra factor of (x - 2) in the denominator. So maybe we need a substitution that can handle that.\n\nLet me think. If I ignore the (x - 2) term for a moment, the integral would look like the beta function with parameters related to 2/5 and 3/5. But the (x - 2) complicates things. Maybe we can use substitution to transform the integral into a beta function form. Alternatively, maybe a substitution that rationalizes the denominator or combines terms in a way that the hypergeometric function comes into play.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes integrals with terms like (x - a) in the denominator can be handled by substitutions that involve Möbius transformations or other fractional linear transformations. Since the interval is from 0 to 1, and there's a singularity at x=2, which is outside the interval, maybe we can map the interval to another domain where the integral becomes more manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a substitution like t = x/(1 - x) or t = (1 - x)/x? Let me try that. Let's let t = x/(1 - x). Then x = t/(1 + t), and dx = dt/(1 + t)^2. When x=0, t=0; when x=1, t approaches infinity. But our integral is from 0 to 1, so substituting t would lead to an integral from 0 to infinity. Not sure if that helps. Let's see:\n\nOriginal integrand: 1 / [ (x - 2) * x^(2/5) * (1 - x)^(3/5) ]\n\nSubstitute x = t/(1 + t), so 1 - x = 1/(1 + t). Then x - 2 = t/(1 + t) - 2 = (t - 2(1 + t))/ (1 + t) ) = (t - 2 - 2t)/(1 + t) ) = (-t - 2)/(1 + t). So the denominator (x - 2) becomes (-t - 2)/(1 + t). The x^(2/5) becomes [t/(1 + t)]^(2/5), and (1 - x)^(3/5) becomes [1/(1 + t)]^(3/5). Putting it all together:\n\nDenominator: [ (-t - 2)/(1 + t) ] * [ t/(1 + t) ]^(2/5) * [1/(1 + t)]^(3/5) )\n\nMultiply the terms: [ (-t - 2) / (1 + t) ] * [ t^(2/5) / (1 + t)^(2/5) ) ] * [ 1 / (1 + t)^(3/5) ) ]\n\nCombine the denominators: (1 + t) * (1 + t)^(2/5) * (1 + t)^(3/5) ) = (1 + t)^{1 + 2/5 + 3/5} = (1 + t)^{1 + 1} = (1 + t)^2.\n\nSo the denominator becomes (-t - 2) * t^(2/5) / (1 + t)^2.\n\nThus, the integrand becomes [ (1 + t)^2 / ( - (t + 2) * t^(2/5) ) ] * dx. But dx is dt/(1 + t)^2.\n\nSo combining everything: [ (1 + t)^2 / ( - (t + 2) * t^(2/5) ) ) ] * [ dt / (1 + t)^2 ) ] = -1 / [ (t + 2) t^(2/5) ) ] dt.\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes - integral from t=0 to t=∞ of 1 / [ (t + 2) t^(2/5) ] dt. Hmm, so this is - ∫₀^∞ dt / [ t^(2/5) (t + 2) ].\n\nThat's interesting. So after substitution, the integral becomes a standard integral from 0 to infinity. Maybe this is a known integral. Let me recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{c - 1} / (1 + t)^{a + b} dt is related to beta functions or gamma functions. But here, the denominator is (t + 2) instead of (1 + t). Maybe another substitution. Let u = t / 2. Then t = 2u, dt = 2 du. Then the integral becomes:\n\n- ∫₀^∞ 2 du / [ (2u)^(2/5) (2u + 2) ) ] = - 2 / [ 2^(2/5) * 2 ] ∫₀^∞ u^{ -2/5 } / (u + 1) du = - 2 / (2^(7/5)) ∫₀^∞ u^{-2/5} / (u + 1) du.\n\nWait, the integral ∫₀^∞ u^{k} / (u + 1)^{a} du is related to beta or gamma functions. Let me recall that ∫₀^∞ u^{c - 1} / (1 + u)^{a + b} du = B(a, b) when appropriately parametrized. Alternatively, using the substitution u = 1/v, but maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the integral ∫₀^∞ u^{c} / (1 + u) du. Let me set u = v, so if c is such that the integral converges. Let's see, for convergence at 0, we need c > -1, and at infinity, we need c < 0. Here, in our case, we have u^{-2/5} / (u + 1). So exponent is -2/5, so c = -2/5. Then convergence at 0: -2/5 > -1? Yes. At infinity: -2/5 < 0, so converges. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ u^{-2/5} / (u + 1) du is a known integral.\n\nI remember that ∫₀^∞ u^{s - 1} / (1 + u) du = π / sin(π s) for 0 < s < 1. This is from the beta function or the reflection formula of the gamma function. So if we set s - 1 = -2/5, then s = 3/5. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ u^{-2/5} / (u + 1) du = π / sin(3π/5).\n\nTherefore, going back to the integral:\n\n- 2 / 2^(7/5) * π / sin(3π/5) = - 2^(1 - 7/5) π / sin(3π/5) = - 2^(-2/5) π / sin(3π/5).\n\nNow, 2^(11/10) is equal to 2^(1 + 1/10) = 2 * 2^(1/10). Wait, but the answer given is - 2^{11/10} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)}. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, compute sin(3π/5). 3π/5 is 108 degrees. The sine of 108 degrees is sin(π - 72) = sin(72 degrees) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5))/ (2 * 2^(1/2)) ) Wait, sin(72°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2^(1/2). Wait, let's recall that sin(72°) = sqrt[(5 + sqrt(5))/8] * 2. Let me check:\n\nWe know that sin(72°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, but maybe more accurately, using exact formulas.\n\nAlternatively, sin(π/5) = sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2, and sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2.\n\nWait, actually, sin(3π/5) is equal to sin(2π/5) because sin(π - x) = sin x. So 3π/5 = π - 2π/5, so sin(3π/5) = sin(2π/5). So sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2. Let me verify:\n\nThe exact value of sin(2π/5) is sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) multiplied by 2, which simplifies to sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) / 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that:\n\nUsing the formula for sin(2π/5):\n\nLet’s use the identity that sin(2π/5) = 2 sin(π/5) cos(π/5). We know that cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Hmm, maybe better to use exact expressions.\n\nAlternatively, from the golden ratio. Let’s recall that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, perhaps it's better to look up exact values.\n\nBut perhaps we can relate sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) to sin(2π/5). Let me compute sin(2π/5):\n\nsin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2. So sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2 = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) / sqrt(4) ) * 2 = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) * 1/2 * 2 = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Wait, that seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute sin(2π/5):\n\nWe can use the formula for sin(2π/5):\n\nUsing the identity sin(2π/5) = 2 sin(π/5) cos(π/5).\n\nWe know that sin(π/5) = sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, note that sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2, which is equivalent to sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) / (2 * sqrt(2)) ) * 2 = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) / sqrt(2). Therefore, sin(2π/5) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) / sqrt(2) * 1/2 * 2? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the identity that sin(π - x) = sin x, so sin(3π/5) = sin(2π/5). Then, using the formula for sin(2π/5) in terms of radicals:\n\nAccording to some sources, sin(2π/5) = (sqrt(10 - 2*sqrt(5)))/4, but that might not directly help. Wait, let me compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) ≈ sqrt(5 + 2.236) ≈ sqrt(7.236) ≈ 2.689. Then sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) / sqrt(2) ≈ 2.689 / 1.414 ≈ 1.902. But sin(2π/5) ≈ sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. So that doesn't align. Wait, so perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let's compute sin(2π/5):\n\n2π/5 radians is 72 degrees. The exact value is sqrt(5 + sqrt(5))/ (2 * sqrt(2)) ) * 2? Hmm, let's actually compute it using exact formulas. Let me recall that:\n\ncos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(36°) is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2. Let me check:\n\nFrom the pentagon, we know that cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, maybe I need to derive it.\n\nLet’s use the double-angle formula. Let θ = 36°, so 2θ = 72°, and 3θ = 108°, which is supplementary to 72°, so sin(3θ) = sin(72°).\n\nAlternatively, using the identity for cos(5θ) = 0 when θ = 36°, since 5*36°=180°, so cos(180°)= -1. But maybe this is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that 2 cos(72°) = 2 sin(18°), but perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for sin(2π/5):\n\nWe can use the identity that 4 sin^2(2π/5) = 2 - 2 cos(4π/5). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that in a regular pentagon, the diagonal over side is the golden ratio φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. The trigonometric values related to pentagon angles involve the golden ratio.\n\nActually, there's a formula that sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2. Let me verify numerically:\n\nsqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) = sqrt( (5 + 2.236)/8 ) = sqrt(7.236/8 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9045) ≈ 0.9511, which matches sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. Therefore, sin(2π/5) = 2 * sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ), which is sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ). So sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) / 2 * 2? Wait, no.\n\nWait, sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2 = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * sqrt(4) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 * 4 ) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Therefore, sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ). So, sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ≈ 0.9511.\n\nWait, that's not correct numerically, because sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/2 ) ≈ sqrt( (5 + 2.236)/2 ) ≈ sqrt(7.236/2) ≈ sqrt(3.618) ≈ 1.902, which is greater than 1. That can't be. So there must be an error in this derivation.\n\nAh, my mistake. Let me correct that. The exact value is 2 sin(π/5) cos(π/5). Let me compute sin(π/5) and cos(π/5):\n\nFrom the pentagon, we know that cos(π/5) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Wait, actually, cos(36°) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2. Let me compute this:\n\ncos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2. So cos(36°) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2. But (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 ≈ (2.236 + 1)/2 ≈ 1.618/2 ≈ 0.809, which is correct because cos(36°) ≈ 0.809.\n\nSimilarly, sin(36°) = sqrt(1 - cos²(36°)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6545) ≈ sqrt(0.3455) ≈ 0.5878. Which is approximately correct.\n\nThen sin(72°) = 2 sin(36°) cos(36°) ≈ 2 * 0.5878 * 0.809 ≈ 0.951, which matches.\n\nBut how to express sin(72°) in terms of radicals? From the double-angle formula:\n\nsin(72°) = 2 sin(36°) cos(36°). But sin(36°) can be expressed as sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2, and cos(36°) as (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2. Therefore:\n\nsin(72°) = 2 * [sqrt( (5 - sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2 ] * [ (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 ]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let me find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using complex numbers and roots of unity. But perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nBack to the integral. We had:\n\nIntegral becomes -2^(-2/5) π / sin(3π/5). And sin(3π/5) is sin(2π/5) = sqrt( (5 + sqrt(5))/8 ) * 2. Wait, but numerically:\n\nsin(3π/5) = sin(108°) ≈ 0.9511, and sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)) ≈ sqrt(5 + 2.236) ≈ sqrt(7.236) ≈ 2.689. Then sqrt(5 + sqrt(5))/sqrt(2) ≈ 2.689 / 1.414 ≈ 1.902. Which is not equal to 0.9511. So perhaps there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, earlier I had:\n\nAfter substitution, the integral became:\n\n- 2^(-2/5) π / sin(3π/5).\n\nBut the answer given is -2^{11/10} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)}.\n\nLet’s see. Let's compute 2^{-2/5} = 1 / 2^{2/5} = 2^{-2/5}. The answer has 2^{11/10} in the numerator, so negative exponent. Let's see:\n\nIf we have - 2^{-2/5} π / sin(3π/5), and we need to express this as -2^{11/10} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5)}.\n\nLet’s relate sin(3π/5) to sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\nSuppose sin(3π/5) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} / something. Let me square both sides:\n\nsin²(3π/5) = (5 + sqrt(5)) / x².\n\nWe know that sin²(108°) = sin²(72°) ≈ (0.9511)^2 ≈ 0.9045.\n\nCompute (5 + sqrt(5)) / x² ≈ 0.9045. Let’s solve for x:\n\nx² = (5 + sqrt(5)) / 0.9045 ≈ (5 + 2.236)/0.9045 ≈ 7.236 / 0.9045 ≈ 8. So x ≈ sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). Therefore, sin(3π/5) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} / (2*sqrt(2)) ). Therefore, sin(3π/5) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} / (2*sqrt(2)) ).\n\nBut let's check that:\n\nsqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} / (2*sqrt(2)) ≈ sqrt(7.236) / (2.828) ≈ 2.689 / 2.828 ≈ 0.951, which matches sin(72°). Therefore, sin(3π/5) = sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} / (2*sqrt(2)) ).\n\nTherefore, 1/sin(3π/5) = 2*sqrt(2) / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\nPlugging this back into the integral expression:\n\n-2^{-2/5} π * 2*sqrt(2) / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} ) = -2^{1 - 2/5} sqrt(2) π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\nBut 1 - 2/5 = 3/5, and sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, so:\n\n-2^{3/5} * 2^{1/2} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}} ) = -2^{3/5 + 1/2} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\n3/5 + 1/2 = (6/10 + 5/10) = 11/10. Therefore, this is -2^{11/10} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\nWhich matches the given answer! Therefore, the integral evaluates to -2^{11/10} π / sqrt(5 + sqrt(5}}.\n\nSo the steps involved substituting t = x/(1 - x), transforming the integral into a standard form that relates to the beta function or gamma function, then using the integral identity involving sin(π s), and finally simplifying using trigonometric identities to express the result in terms of radicals. The key was recognizing the integral after substitution as a known form and relating it to the gamma/beta functions or their properties. The substitution t = x/(1 - x) was crucial in transforming the original integral into a more manageable form.",
