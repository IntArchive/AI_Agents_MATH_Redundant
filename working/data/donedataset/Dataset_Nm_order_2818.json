    "AcceptedAnswer": "Having a dense span is just one of the conditions a family $\\{e_n\\}$ must satisfy to be a Schauder basis. The much more restrictive condition is that there are (continuous) coordinate linear forms $\\xi_n$ such that for every $x\\in X$ we have $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left\\lVert x - \\sum_{k=0}^n \\xi_k(x)\\cdot e_k\\right\\rVert = 0.$$ For the space $C([0,1])$, the convergence is uniform convergence, and for the sequence of monomials - $e_k(t) = t^k$ - that would mean that every continuous function had a representation $$f(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\xi_k(f)\\cdot t^k$$ as a power series, which converges uniformly on $[0,1]$. But the limit function of a convergent power series is (real-) analytic, and only a tiny minority of continuous functions is real-analytic (and of those that are, a lot have singularities in the unit disk).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. So the user wants to know why the monomials {p_n} where p_n(x) = x^n are not a Schauder basis for C[0,1], even though their span is dense due to the Weierstrass approximation theorem. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Schauder basis is. A Schauder basis for a Banach space is a sequence {e_n} such that every element in the space can be uniquely expressed as a convergent series of the form ∑a_n e_n, where the convergence is with respect to the Banach space norm—in this case, the sup norm on C[0,1].\n\nSo, even though the monomials are dense (meaning any continuous function can be approximated uniformly by polynomials), the key issue here is the uniqueness of the representation and the convergence in the Schauder basis sense. \n\nOne possible angle is that for a Schauder basis, the coefficients must depend continuously on the function. In other words, the coefficient functionals must be continuous. If the monomials were a Schauder basis, then each coefficient a_n in the expansion f = ∑a_n x^n would have to be a continuous linear functional on C[0,1]. But in the case of monomials, the coefficients are related to the Taylor coefficients, which involve derivatives of the function at 0. However, differentiation is not a continuous operation in C[0,1] under the sup norm. For example, a small perturbation in the function (in sup norm) can lead to large changes in its derivatives, hence large changes in the coefficients. This suggests that the coefficient functionals might not be bounded, violating the Schauder basis condition.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the specific properties of Schauder bases. A Schauder basis requires that the projections P_n, which map a function to the sum of the first n terms of its expansion, are uniformly bounded in operator norm. If the projections are not uniformly bounded, then the basis fails to be a Schauder basis. For the monomials, these projections would correspond to partial sums of the power series. However, it's known that the partial sums of a power series do not necessarily converge uniformly on [0,1] for all continuous functions, except for analytic functions. Since C[0,1] contains non-analytic functions, the uniform convergence might fail, implying the projections aren't uniformly bounded.\n\nMoreover, a classic example is the function f(x) = |x - 1/2|, which is continuous on [0,1] but not analytic. If we try to express it as a power series, the partial sums would not converge uniformly because the function isn't smooth. This indicates that the monomials can't form a Schauder basis since there exist functions in C[0,1] that can't be represented as a uniformly convergent series of polynomials with unique coefficients.\n\nAdditionally, the uniqueness aspect is also a problem. If there were two different sequences of coefficients that converge to the same function, then the basis would not be Schauder. However, the Weierstrass theorem ensures density, not uniqueness. The monomials are not linearly independent in an infinite-dimensional sense required for a Schauder basis. Wait, actually, monomials are linearly independent, but the issue is more about the convergence and the continuity of coefficient functionals.\n\nAnother angle is to reference specific theorems or known results. For instance, the Müntz–Szász theorem states that the set {x^λ_n} is dense in C[0,1] if and only if the series ∑1/λ_n diverges, where λ_n are distinct positive real numbers. In our case, λ_n = n, so ∑1/n diverges, which is why the monomials are dense (aligning with Weierstrass). However, density doesn't imply being a Schauder basis. The Müntz theorem doesn't directly address the Schauder basis property, but it's related to the structure of the basis.\n\nFurthermore, in the context of Banach spaces, a Schauder basis requires that the basis elements and coefficient functionals satisfy certain boundedness conditions. The space C[0,1] is separable, so it does have Schauder bases (like the Faber-Schauder system), but the monomials specifically are not one of them. The problem is that the monomials form a basis only if every function has a unique expansion, which is not the case here. For example, different sequences of polynomials (not necessarily the partial sums of a single power series) can approximate the same function, but a Schauder basis requires a unique sequence of coefficients.\n\nTo sum up, the main reasons are:\n1. The coefficient functionals associated with the monomials are not continuous in the sup norm.\n2. The projections corresponding to partial sums of the power series are not uniformly bounded.\n3. Existence of continuous functions that are not analytic, hence cannot be represented as a uniformly convergent power series.\n4. Uniqueness of representation fails in the Schauder basis sense, despite density.",
