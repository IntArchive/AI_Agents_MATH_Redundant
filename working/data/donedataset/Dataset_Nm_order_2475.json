    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The goal is to find the limit as x approaches 1 of [x^(1/m) - 1]/[x^(1/n) - 1] and show that it equals n/m. The user mentioned not using L'Hôpital's rule, so I need to think of another approach.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with limits of the form (x^a - 1)/x as x approaches 1, substitution might lead to a 0/0 indeterminate form. Since substituting x=1 here gives [1 - 1]/[1 - 1] which is 0/0, maybe there's a way to manipulate the expression to resolve this.\n\nOne common method for limits like this is to use a substitution to make the variable approach 0 instead of 1. Let me set t = x - 1, so as x approaches 1, t approaches 0. Then x = 1 + t. But I'm not sure if that's the best substitution. Alternatively, maybe set t = x^(1/n) - 1, so that when x approaches 1, t approaches 0. Let me try that.\n\nIf I let t = x^(1/n) - 1, then x = (1 + t)^n. Then the denominator becomes t. The numerator becomes [(1 + t)^n]^(1/m) - 1 = (1 + t)^(n/m) - 1. So the limit becomes [(1 + t)^(n/m) - 1]/t as t approaches 0. The limit of this expression as t approaches 0 is the derivative of (1 + t)^(n/m) at t=0, which is (n/m)(1 + 0)^(n/m - 1) = n/m. So that would give the desired result. Wait, but this approach uses the definition of the derivative, which is similar to using L'Hôpital's rule? Maybe not exactly, but if the user wants to avoid calculus entirely, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for small h, (1 + h)^k ≈ 1 + kh. This is the binomial approximation. Let's try using this. Let me set x = 1 + h, where h approaches 0. Then x^(1/m) ≈ 1 + (1/m)h and similarly x^(1/n) ≈ 1 + (1/n)h. Plugging into the expression:\n\n[ (1 + (1/m)h - 1 ) ] / [ (1 + (1/n)h - 1 ) ] = (h/m) / (h/n) = n/m. So the limit is n/m. But this is using the linear approximation of the function around h=0, which is essentially using the derivative, so maybe again similar to L'Hôpital.\n\nAlternatively, factor the numerator and denominator. Let me write x as 1 + t, where t approaches 0. Then x^(1/m) - 1 can be written as e^(ln(1 + t)/m) - 1. Using the expansion ln(1 + t) ≈ t - t^2/2 + t^3/3 - ..., so ln(1 + t)/m ≈ t/m. Then e^(t/m) ≈ 1 + t/m + (t/m)^2/2 + ... So x^(1/m) - 1 ≈ t/m. Similarly x^(1/n) - 1 ≈ t/n. So the ratio would be (t/m)/(t/n) = n/m. Therefore, the limit is n/m.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution y = x^(1/(mn)) to make both exponents have denominator mn. Let me try that. Let y = x^(1/(mn)), so x = y^{mn}. Then x^(1/m) = y^{n} and x^(1/n) = y^{m}. The expression becomes (y^n - 1)/(y^m - 1). Factor both numerator and denominator. The numerator y^n - 1 factors as (y - 1)(y^{n-1} + y^{n-2} + ... + 1) and the denominator similarly as (y - 1)(y^{m-1} + ... + 1). Then the (y - 1) terms cancel, leaving [sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^k] / [sum_{k=0}^{m-1} y^k]. As x approaches 1, y approaches 1 since y = x^{1/(mn)}. Therefore, each sum becomes n and m respectively, so the limit is n/m. That seems like a solid algebraic approach without calculus.\n\nYes, this substitution method works. Let me check again. If y = x^{1/(mn)}, then as x → 1, y → 1. Then (y^n - 1)/(y^m - 1) = [ (y - 1)(y^{n-1} + ... + 1) ] / [ (y - 1)(y^{m-1} + ... + 1) ] = (sum y^{n-1} ...)/(sum y^{m-1} ...). Then when y approaches 1, each term in the sum becomes 1, so the numerator sum is n terms, denominator is m terms. Therefore, the limit is n/m. Perfect, this uses algebraic factoring and substitution without calculus.\n\nSo the key steps are substitution y = x^{1/(mn)} to rewrite the expression, factor numerator and denominator, cancel the common (y - 1) term, then evaluate the remaining sums as y approaches 1. Therefore, the limit is n/m as required.\n\nAnother alternative approach could be to use the standard limit formula: lim_{x→a} (x^k - a^k)/(x - a) = k a^{k-1}. But here, if we set a=1, then lim_{x→1} (x^{k} - 1)/(x - 1) = k. However, in the original problem, the denominator is x^{1/n} - 1 and numerator is x^{1/m} - 1. Let me make a substitution t = x - 1, so x = 1 + t. Then as x→1, t→0. Then x^{1/m} - 1 ≈ (1 + t)^{1/m} - 1 ≈ t/m. Similarly denominator ≈ t/n. So the ratio is (t/m)/(t/n) = n/m. But this is similar to the binomial approximation approach. However, this might be considered using the derivative or L’Hospital’s indirectly.\n\nSince the user wants to avoid L’Hospital’s, the substitution y = x^{1/(mn)} and factoring seems the most algebraic and acceptable method. Therefore, the answer is proven by substitution and factoring.",
