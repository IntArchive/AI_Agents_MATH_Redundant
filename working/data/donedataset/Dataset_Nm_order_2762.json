    "Content": "In Peter Szekeres's \"A Course in Modern Mathematical Physics\" problem 1.13 asks: \"Prove the set of all real functions $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has a higher cardinality than that of the real numbers by using a Cantor diagonal argument to show it cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$ .\" The proof in the official solutions manual is \"Suppose the real functions could be put in one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. Then they could be labelled by real numbers, $f_x : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ , one and exactly one function for each real number $x$ . Let $F : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the real function defined by $F(x) = f_x (x) + 1$ . This function clearly cannot be labelled by any real number, for if $F = f_y$ for some $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , then $$\n\\begin{equation*}\nf_y (y) = F(y) = f_y (y) + 1,\n\\end{equation*}\n$$ an obvious contradiction.\" I follow the proof, but how is this a type of Cantor diagonal argument? For example, the proof given on the Cantor's diagonal argument Wikipedia page for uncountable sets seems quite different. Is there some general form of the Cantor diagonal argument I'm missing, or is the Cantor diagonal argument simply any proof of the uncountability of a set?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It is the exact same idea: you have a family of functions indexed by the domain of the functions, and you use this fact to construct a function not in the initial family. (Aside: I really wish authors would stop proving Cantor's Theorem and variants by \"contradiction\"; it's really a contrapositive proof that has been converted to a \"proof by contradiction\" by adding the contrary assumption at the top, and then parading it at the end to claim the desired contradiction; just do a contrapositive proof!). That is, it is an instance of the following argument: Diagonal Argument. Let $S$ be a nonempty set, and let $X$ be a set with at least two elements. Let $\\{f_s\\}_{s\\in S}$ be a family indexed by $S$ , where each $f_s$ is a function $f_s\\colon S\\to X$ with domain $S$ and codomain $X$ . Then there exists a function $g\\colon S\\to X$ such that $g\\neq f_s$ for all $s\\in S$ . Proof. Since $X$ has at least two elements, let $a,b\\in X$ , with $a\\neq b$ . Define $g$ as follows: given $s\\in S$ , we let $$g(s) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\na & \\text{if }f_s(s) \\neq a;\\\\\nb &  \\text{if }f_s(s)=a.\n\\end{array}\\right.$$ This is a function with domain $S$ and codomain $X$ . To show that $g\\neq f_s$ for each $s\\in S$ , let $s_0\\in S$ . Then $g(s_0) \\neq f_{s_0}(s_0)$ by construction. Since two functions $S\\to X$ are equal if and only if they take the same value at each and every element of $S$ , and $g$ and $f_{s_0}$ take different values at $s_0$ , it follows that $g\\neq f_{s_0}$ , as claimed. Thus, $g$ is a function from $S\\to X$ that is not in our original collection. $\\Box$ (Why is it called the \"Diagonal Argument\"? Because if you imagine your functions as being in a square \"table\", where the rows and columns are labeled by elements of $s$ , with each row describing the values of a function, so that the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ is the value of the $i$ th function at $j$ , $f_i(j)$ , then we are constructing $g$ by looking at the values at the \"diagonal\" of the table, the entries $(s,s)$ .) This argument is the engine of the proof of Cantor's Theorem (no set can be put in bijective correspondence with its power set), Cantor's second proof of uncountability of the real numbers, and the result you quote. (I use $a$ and $b$ so I don't have to worry about the Axiom of Choice, which is likely not on your radar; but all you need is a method by which you can take the value $f_s(s)$ , and get something different . If your values are taken in $\\mathbb{N}$ , or in $\\mathbb{R}$ , you can just \"add one\", and that will do. All you need is a way to take the value $f_s(s)$ , and find some different value in $X$ .) To see this explicitly, let's look at those arguments: 1. Cantor's Theorem. Let $S$ be a set. Then there is no bijection between $S$ and its power set $P(S)$ . Explicitly, if $F\\colon S\\to P(S)$ is any function, then $F$ is not surjective. Proof. We can think of the power set as being made up of functions with domain $S$ and image $\\{0,1\\}$ (by using characteristic functions). If $F\\colon S\\to P(S)$ is any function, then let $f_s\\colon S\\to \\{0,1\\}$ be the function corresponding to the subset $F(s)$ . Then $\\{f_s\\}_{s\\in S}$ is a family of functions indexed by $S$ with domain $S$ and codomain having at least two elements. By the Diagonal Argument, the function $g\\colon S\\to \\{0,1\\}$ given by $$g(s) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\text{if }f_s(s)=0,\\\\\n0 &\\text{if }f_s(s)=1\n\\end{array}\\right.$$ is not in the family, hence not in the image of $F$ . $\\Box$ Note that thinking about sets and subsets, the definition of $g$ gives the subset $$g = \\{ s\\in S\\mid s\\notin F(s)\\}$$ which is the way we usually see the proof of Cantor's Theorem. 2. Cantor's second proof of uncountability of the reals numbers. If $F\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to[0,1]$ is a function, then $F$ is not surjective. In particular, there is no surjection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $[0,1]$ . Proof. Consider the real numbers in $[0,1]$ . Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the positive integers. We think of each such real number $r$ as a function $r\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ , where $r(k)$ is the $k$ th digit in the decimal expression for $r$ (having chosen the expression that does not have a tail of $9$ s, if such exists); conversely, every function from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots,9\\}$ determines a real number (thought two different functions make determine the same real number, if one of them has a tail of $9$ s... we'll ignore this because we can avoid the issue in the argument). Now let $F\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to[0,1]$ be a function. We let $f_n$ be the function determined by the real number $F(n)$ . We now look at the family $\\Bigl\\{f_n\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\{0,1,\\ldots,9\\}\\Bigr\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ , and choose $a$ and $b$ as in the Diagonal Argument to be $5$ and $6$ . The Diagonal Argument produces a function $g\\colon\\mathbb{N}\\to\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,9\\}$ that is not in our original family, hence a real number $g$ that is not in the image of $F$ , as desired. (Because $g$ only takes values in $\\{5,6\\}$ , the issue of dual decimal representation is irrelevant). $\\Box$ Viewing the function $g$ as a real number, we see that it is a real number whose $n$ th decimal digit is different from the $n$ th decimal digit of the $n$ th number in our original list $F$ ; that is, the usual way the argument is presented. 3. Theorem. The set of function $\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ cannot be put in bijective correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$ . Equivalently: if $F\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{R}}$ is a function, then $F$ is not surjective. (Here $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{R}}$ is the set of function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ ) Proof . Let $F\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{R}}$ . Let $f_r=F(r)$ for each $r\\in \\mathbb{R}$ . Then $\\{f_r\\}_{r\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ is a family of functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ indexed by $\\mathbb{R}$ . By the Diagonal Argument, there is a function $G\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is not one of the $f_r$ ; i.e., not in the image of $F$ . $\\Box$ Here we can construct the function $G$ by picking any two reals as in the Diagonal Argument, or as in the parenthetical comment I made below it, by just defining $G(r)$ to be a number different from $f_r(r)$ , for instance $f_r(r)+1$ , as the author does.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's break down the user's request and the example they provided. They want me to act as a bilingual math professor, take a question from Math Stack Exchange, filter out unrelated information, and structure it into their specified format. The format includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the example they gave. The original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the assumption was for every integer n, not necessarily divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe the example had a typo or was a specific case. But regardless, the key is to extract the assumptions from the problem and list them each on a separate line, each about one object or property.\n\nNow, looking at the Math Stack Exchange question provided: The user is asking why the given proof is considered a Cantor diagonal argument, noting that it looks different from the standard one on Wikipedia. The problem in the question is from a textbook asking to prove the set of all real functions has higher cardinality than real numbers using a Cantor diagonal argument. The solution uses a diagonal-like argument by constructing a function F(x) = f_x(x) + 1, leading to a contradiction.\n\nSo, to structure this into the required format: The problem is to show that the set of real functions can't be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ using a Cantor diagonal argument. The assumptions here would include the supposition made in the proof, like assuming there's a one-to-one correspondence between real functions and real numbers, labeling functions by real numbers, etc. Each assumption should be a single line about one object or condition.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Real functions f: ℝ → ℝ can be put in one-to-one correspondence with real numbers.\n2. Each real function is labeled by a real number x, denoted as f_x.\n3. The function F: ℝ → ℝ is defined by F(x) = f_x(x) + 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem is to show that the set of all real functions has a higher cardinality than ℝ using a Cantor diagonal argument, leading to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but the problem statement as given in the original question is to \"Prove the set of all real functions... cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ by using a Cantor diagonal argument.\" So the problem is to prove that, and the assumptions are the premises used in the proof, which are part of the problem's setup. However, in the example provided, the assumptions included conditions on n. Here, the main assumption is the supposition for contradiction: that there exists a one-to-one correspondence. So perhaps the assumption here is the negation of what's to be proven, which is part of the proof by contradiction.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n- There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all real functions f: ℝ → ℝ and the real numbers ℝ.\n- Each real function is labeled uniquely by a real number x, i.e., f_x corresponds to x.\n- The function F is defined as F(x) = f_x(x) + 1 for all x ∈ ℝ.\n\nProblem: Prove that the set of all real functions f: ℝ → ℝ has a higher cardinality than ℝ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated in the original question is exactly that. So maybe the assumptions are the ones used in the proof, which are part of the problem's setup. Alternatively, the problem's own assumptions (like the functions are real functions, etc.) but the user's example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the example might have been incorrect. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was from a different problem? That might be confusing. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to extract assumptions from the problem given.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking about why the given proof is a Cantor diagonal argument. The problem they need to structure is the one from the textbook: proving the set of real functions can't be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ via Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nSo the original problem's assumptions would be the ones used in the proof by contradiction. So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. Assume, for contradiction, that the set of real functions ℝ → ℝ is in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ.\n2. Therefore, each real function can be labeled uniquely by a real number x, denoted as f_x.\n3. Define a function F: ℝ → ℝ by F(x) = f_x(x) + 1.\n\nEach of these is a step in setting up the contradiction. But the problem is to prove the original statement using a Cantor diagonal argument. So the problem statement is the original question, and the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem or used in the proof.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just the textbook problem, so the assumptions would be the givens. The textbook problem says \"Prove the set of all real functions... using a Cantor diagonal argument.\" So the problem is that. The assumptions would be:\n\n- The set of real functions f: ℝ → ℝ is considered.\n- The task is to show this set has higher cardinality than ℝ.\n- The method to be used is a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut the example given by the user had specific mathematical assumptions. So maybe in this case, the problem is structured with the assumptions being the key elements of the proof setup. But I need to follow the user's example structure, which in their example included the problem's own conditions as assumptions. However, the example might have been incorrect. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem was misrepresented.\n\nBut putting that aside, for the current problem, the key is to list the assumptions as per the problem's setup. The problem is to prove that the set of real functions cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ using Cantor's diagonal argument. The assumptions here are the suppositions made in the proof, which are:\n\n1. Suppose the set of real functions can be put in one-to-one correspondence with ℝ.\n2. Therefore, each real function is labeled by a unique real number x, denoted f_x.\n3. Define the function F(x) = f_x(x) + 1.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption step in the proof by contradiction. Therefore, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving the higher cardinality via Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nBut the problem statement itself is to prove that, so maybe the problem line is the original problem statement, and the assumptions are the ones used in the proof. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to explain why the given proof is a Cantor diagonal argument, but the user wants the structured format for the problem presented in the question (the textbook problem), not the question about why it's considered a diagonal argument.\n\nThe user's instruction is: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nThe Math Stack Exchange question here is titled \"What qualifies as a Cantor diagonal argument?\" and the user is asking about the problem presented in the question, which is the textbook problem 1.13. So the problem to structure is the textbook problem, not the meta-question about why it's a diagonal argument. The user's example formatted the problem from the original problem statement, not the question about the problem.\n\nTherefore, I need to structure the textbook problem as per the format, listing assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe textbook problem is: \"Prove the set of all real functions $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has a higher cardinality than that of the real numbers by using a Cantor diagonal argument to show it cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are the premises given in the problem:\n\n1. The set considered is all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. The task is to compare its cardinality with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3. The method required is a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object. For instance, in the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the suppositions made in the proof, which are:\n\n1. Assume the set of real functions can be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. Each function is labeled by a real number x, i.e., $f_x$ corresponds to x.\n3. Define $F(x) = f_x(x) + 1$.\n\nBut these are steps in the proof, not assumptions given in the problem. The problem itself doesn't state these; these are part of the solution. The original problem's assumption is just the general setup: real functions from R to R, and the goal to prove higher cardinality via diagonal argument.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions inherent in the problem. For example, the problem is about real functions, so the assumption is that we're dealing with real functions. But in the user's example, the assumption was about n being an integer, which is part of the problem's hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, for the textbook problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set consists of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\nProblem:\nProve that this set has a higher cardinality than $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut the user's example included more specific assumptions related to the problem's variables. However, in this problem, the only inherent assumption is the set we're dealing with. But the actual proof's assumptions (like the one-to-one correspondence) are part of the proof by contradiction, not the problem's given assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the objects involved. In the user's example, the original problem was about an integer n, so the assumption was that n is an integer, which is given in the problem statement. The second assumption in the example was \"n is divisible by 7,\" which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example had a mistake. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted version added that n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Perhaps the user made an error in their example.\n\nGiven that, maybe the correct approach is to list the explicit assumptions given in the problem statement. For the current problem, the textbook problem's assumptions would be:\n\n- The set in consideration is all real functions from ℝ to ℝ.\n- The real numbers ℝ have a certain cardinality.\n- The task is to compare cardinalities using Cantor's diagonal argument.\n\nBut according to the user's format, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set S consists of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The set $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n- A Cantor diagonal argument is to be applied.\n\nBut the problem statement itself is to prove that S has higher cardinality than ℝ using Cantor's diagonal. So perhaps the assumptions are the basic premises:\n\n1. $S$ is the set of all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n3. A one-to-one correspondence between $S$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ is assumed for contradiction.\n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly state these; they are part of the context. However, following the user's example, which included assumptions from the problem statement (even if the example was flawed), here the key assumption leading to the contradiction is the existence of a one-to-one correspondence. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut that's the assumption made in the proof by contradiction, not the problem's given. The problem is to disprove that by using the diagonal argument. So perhaps the formatted problem should have that assumption as part of the problem setup, leading to the contradiction.\n\nWait, the user's example took the original problem, which was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and in the formatted version, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7; it said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example was incorrect, and the actual assumption should only be \"n is an integer\". But in that case, the example's formatted problem added an extra assumption. That suggests maybe the user made a mistake, but I should follow their structure regardless.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumption is that a one-to-one correspondence exists, and each function is labeled by a real number. But these are steps in the proof, not the problem's explicit assumptions. However, following the user's example where they included an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), perhaps the idea is to list the key elements used in the proof as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the assumptions to be the conditions required for the problem to be valid. For this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The set of real functions exists.\n- The real numbers have a certain cardinality.\n- Cantor's diagonal argument is applicable.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe it's better to list the suppositions made in the proof as assumptions, as they are critical to the problem's structure.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- Each real function is labeled by a real number $x$, denoted $f_x$.\n- The function $F: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined by $F(x) = f_x(x) + 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has a higher cardinality than $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut this might be including steps from the proof as assumptions. Alternatively, the problem's own assumptions are just the set of functions and the goal. Perhaps the correct way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set considered is all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ have cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all real functions has a higher cardinality than $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut the user's example included specific mathematical conditions (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7), which in the original problem were part of the statement. In this case, the problem's own assumptions are more about the context rather than explicit conditions. Maybe in this case, since the problem is to apply Cantor's diagonal argument, the key assumption is that such an argument is applicable, but that's inherent.\n\nGiven the confusion from the user's example, I think the best approach is to list the explicit mathematical assumptions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove higher cardinality using Cantor's diagonal, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The set of real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists.\n- Cantor's diagonal argument is a valid method for proving uncountability.\n\nBut these are more meta-assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is to show that the set can't be put in one-to-one correspondence with R, the main assumption for contradiction is that such a correspondence exists. But that's part of the proof method, not the problem's given assumptions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed to structure it as follows, mirroring the example but focusing on the problem's elements:\n\nAssumption:\n- The set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is considered.\n- The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ have cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n- A one-to-one correspondence between the set of real functions and $\\mathbb{R}$ is assumed.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were more about the variables in the problem. Here, the variables are the functions and real numbers. However, since the problem is about cardinality and using a specific proof method, perhaps the key assumption is the existence of the one-to-one correspondence, which is the starting point of the diagonal argument.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the objects involved, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a real function.\n- The set of all such functions is considered.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the cardinality of this set is higher than that of $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nBut I think the crucial assumption for the diagonal argument is the initial bijection, which leads to the contradiction. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- Suppose there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- Each real function is labeled by a unique real number $x$, denoted $f_x$.\n- Define the function $F(x) = f_x(x) + 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that this leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the set of real functions has higher cardinality than $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove the higher cardinality using the diagonal argument, so the assumptions would include the supposition for contradiction, the labeling, and the construction of F. Each of these is a separate assumption.\n\nSo, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\n- There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- Each real function is labeled by a real number $x$, denoted $f_x$.\n- The function $F: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as $F(x) = f_x(x) + 1$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set of all real functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has a higher cardinality than $\\mathbb{R}$ using a Cantor diagonal argument.\n\nThis seems to align with the example provided, where assumptions were listed even if they were part of the proof steps.
