    "Content": "In Acute triangle $ABC$ , $PB, PC$ are tangent lines to its circumscribed circle. $E,F$ are on line $AB, AC$ such that $\\angle EPF = 2 \\angle BAC$ . $P$ is within $\\triangle AEF$ . $A'$ is the symmetrical point of $A$ with respect to $EF$ . Prove that the circumscribed circle of $A'EF$ passes through a fixed point. The condition $\\angle EPF = 2 \\angle BAC$ is eye-catching. It would have been interesting if $P$ is the center of a certain circle. Also $\\angle BPC = 180^{o} - 2 \\angle A$ . But I didn't go anywhere too interesting.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This can be proved in two steps. The first step is, of course, locating the point. And there is a very simple but powerful trick to do that: taking the limit. Let's move $E$ to infinity, so $PE$ is parallel to $AB$ . Since $\\angle BPC=\\pi-\\angle BOC=\\pi-2\\angle A$ , where $O$ is the circumcenter, and $\\angle EPF=2\\angle A$ , we must have $\\angle CPF=\\pi-\\angle BPE=\\pi-\\angle ABP=\\pi/2-\\angle ABO=\\angle C$ . Similarly, we find that $\\angle PCF=\\angle B$ . That means, $\\angle PFC=\\angle A$ . $A'$ is $A$ reflected w.r.t to the line through $F$ and parallel to $AB$ . Now $E$ is at infinity, so the circumcircle of $\\triangle EA'F$ is just the line $A'F$ . Since $EF$ is parallel to $AB$ , $\\angle AFE=\\pi-\\angle A$ . So $\\angle AFA'=2\\angle A$ . We have that $\\angle PFA'\\text{(facing }A\\text{)}=3\\angle A$ . Next, we want to do the same thing on the other side, and get the other line, and find where these two lines cross. That should be the point we are looking for. Here I just named the point on the left side \" $E$ \", although it doesn't correspond to the \" $F$ \" on the right side. Just to make it clear. (Their corresponding $F$ and $E$ are at infinity.) The same reasoning applies to the left side, too. So $\\angle PEB=\\angle A$ , $\\angle PBE=\\angle C$ , $\\angle EPB=\\angle B$ . Now we have $\\angle EPF=\\angle BEP+\\angle CFP+\\angle BAC = 3\\angle A=\\angle PFA'$ , $PE\\parallel A'F$ . ( $A'$ is the same one in the previous picture.) We do the same thing on the other side, draw a line through $E$ and parallel to $PF$ . Let's name the intersection $G$ . We have a parallelogram $PEGF$ , well, unless $\\angle A=\\pi/3$ , in which case they are all on the same line. But let's not worry about that and find the point in more general cases. Noticing that $PB=PC$ and the angles, we have $\\triangle PBE\\cong \\triangle PCF$ , so $CF=PE$ and $BE=PF$ . Because $PEGF$ is a parallelogram, we have $CF=GF$ and $BE=GE$ . Noticing that $\\angle PEG=\\angle PFG$ and $\\angle PEB=\\angle PFC=\\angle A$ , we also have $\\angle GEB=\\angle GFC$ . So the four angles $EBG$ , $EGB$ , $FCG$ , $FGC$ must all be the same. Let's say it's $x$ . So $\\angle AEG=\\angle AFG=\\pi-2x$ . But we have that $\\angle EGF=\\angle EPF=3\\angle A$ , and $\\angle EAF+\\angle EGF+\\angle AEG+\\angle AFG=2\\pi$ . Which leads to $x=\\angle A$ . $ABGC$ is a parallelogram. So, indeed, the observation by @FabiusWiesner in the comment under the question is correct, the point is the symmetric point of $A$ w.r.t center of $BC$ . Now that we found the point by considering the limiting case, next we must prove that the same holds in general. Let's denote $\\angle BPE=\\theta$ . From here on, I'll simply denote $A,B,C$ for $\\angle BAC,\\angle ABC,\\angle ACB$ respectively, so that I don't have to type \\angle every time... Since $\\angle EPF=2A$ and $\\angle BPC=\\pi-2A$ , we have $\\angle CPF=\\pi-\\theta$ . The equations $\\angle PBE=C, \\angle GBE=A, \\angle PCF=B, \\angle GCF=A$ still hold. We want to prove that $\\angle EGF=\\pi-A$ , and $\\angle BGC=A$ , so we want to prove that $\\angle BGE=\\pi-\\angle CGF$ . Let's denote $\\angle BGE=\\alpha$ and $\\angle CGF=\\beta$ . And denote $PB=PC=h$ . And $a, b, c$ for $BC,CA,AB$ respectively. Now we just need to prove $\\alpha=\\pi-\\beta$ . Next, let's express everything in $\\theta$ and $a,b,c,h$ . We have $BE/\\sin\\theta=h/\\sin(\\theta+C)$ from $\\triangle BPE$ , also $BE/\\sin\\alpha=b/\\sin(A+\\alpha)$ from $\\triangle BGE$ , which gives $\\sin(A+\\alpha)/\\sin\\alpha=b\\sin(\\theta+C)/h\\sin\\theta$ . Similarly, from the other side, we get $\\sin(A+\\beta)/\\sin\\beta=c\\sin(\\pi-\\theta+B)/h\\sin(\\pi-\\theta)$ . Since the result doesn't depend on $\\theta$ , we want to cancel out $\\theta$ . Expand both expressions, we get $$\\sin A \\cot\\alpha+\\cos A=\\frac{b}{h}(\\cos C+\\sin C\\cot\\theta)$$ $$\\sin A \\cot\\beta+\\cos A=\\frac{c}{h}(\\cos B+\\sin B\\cot(\\pi-\\theta))$$ Now we just need to multiply the first equation by $c\\sin B$ and the second by $b\\sin C$ and add them to cancel out the terms with $\\theta$ . The result is, $$\\sin A(c\\sin B \\cot\\alpha + b\\sin C \\cot\\beta)+\\cos A(c\\sin B+b\\sin C)=\\frac{bc}{h}\\sin(B+C)$$ We have $h=r\\tan A$ where $r$ is the radius of the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ , and $r=\\frac{a}{2\\sin A}$ , so we have $h=\\frac{a}{2\\cos A}$ . We also have $2r=\\frac{a}{\\sin A}=\\frac{b}{\\sin B}=\\frac{c}{\\sin C}$ , so we can replace $a,b,c$ by $\\sin A, \\sin B, \\sin C$ in the equation above. We also have $A+B+C=\\pi$ so $\\sin(B+C)=\\sin A$ . Putting all that into the equation, we have $$\\sin A\\sin B\\sin C(\\cot\\alpha+\\cot\\beta)+2\\cos A\\sin B\\sin C=2\\cos A\\sin B\\sin C$$ $$ \\cot\\alpha+\\cot\\beta=0$$ Since $0<\\alpha+\\beta<2\\pi$ , the only solution is $$\\alpha=\\pi-\\beta$$ The proof is complete.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem step by step. First, the original question is about an acute triangle ABC. The user mentions PB and PC being tangent lines to the circumscribed circle. Wait, so the circumscribed circle here is the circumcircle of triangle ABC, right? So P is a point from which two tangents are drawn to the circumcircle of ABC, touching it at points B and C. That makes sense because tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal, so PB and PC should be equal in length.\n\nThen, the problem introduces points E and F on lines AB and AC such that angle EPF is equal to twice angle BAC. Also, it's specified that P is within triangle AEF. Next, A' is the symmetrical point of A with respect to EF, which means that EF is the perpendicular bisector of segment AA', so A' is the reflection of A over line EF.\n\nThe main goal is to prove that the circumcircle of triangle A'EF passes through a fixed point, regardless of the positions of E and F (as long as they satisfy the given angle condition). The user also mentions that the angle condition ∠EPF = 2∠BAC is interesting and speculates about P being the center of a circle, but that didn't lead anywhere.\n\nLet me list out the assumptions one by one, ensuring each addresses a single property or condition for one object.\n\nFirst, the triangle ABC is acute. That's one assumption. Then, PB and PC are tangent lines to the circumscribed circle of ABC. So that's another assumption about the tangents from point P to the circumcircle. Then, E and F are on AB and AC respectively. The angle ∠EPF is equal to twice ∠BAC. Then, P is inside triangle AEF. A' is the reflection of A over EF. The problem is to prove the circumcircle of A'EF passes through a fixed point.\n\nWait, so the fixed point here is likely related to the original triangle ABC. Since ABC's circumcircle is involved with the tangents PB and PC, maybe the fixed point is the circumcircle's center or another significant point like the orthocenter? But the problem states \"fixed point,\" which should be independent of E and F's positions as long as they satisfy the angle condition.\n\nAnother thought: If P is the ex-tangent point, perhaps the fixed point is the circumcircle of ABC's center or another point. But since the reflection A' is involved, maybe the fixed point is the orthocenter or centroid? Alternatively, maybe the circumcircle of A'EF passes through the orthocenter of ABC or something similar. Alternatively, since A is reflected over EF to get A', perhaps the fixed point is related to the circumcircle of ABC itself.\n\nAlternatively, considering that PB and PC are tangents to the circumcircle of ABC, then point P lies on the symmedian of ABC, or perhaps is the symmedian point? Wait, but the symmedian is the reflection of the centroid, but I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, if PB and PC are tangents to the circumcircle, then point P lies on the circumcircle's tangent at B and C. Wait, but tangents from P to the circumcircle touch at B and C. Therefore, P lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC? Wait, no. The tangent at B and C would imply that PB and PC are tangents, so P lies on the two tangents. Wait, no. For a given circle, the tangent lines at points B and C would meet at some point, which is the exsimilicenter of BC or something. Hmm, maybe the point P is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle. Alternatively, perhaps it's the symmedian point.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangents from P touch at B and C, then by the property of tangents, PB = PC, and the line OP (where O is the circumcenter) is perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle BPC. Wait, but maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nBut in the problem, the key is that regardless of how E and F are chosen on AB and AC with the angle EPF = 2 angle BAC and P inside AEF, the circumcircle of A'EF (A' being reflection of A over EF) passes through a fixed point.\n\nThe fixed point is likely the orthocenter, circumcenter, centroid, or some other notable center. Alternatively, maybe it's point P itself? But since P is inside AEF and A'EF's circumcircle, maybe not. Alternatively, the circumcircle of ABC's center? Or point A's reflection over something.\n\nAlternatively, since A' is the reflection over EF, and EF is a line related to angle EPF = 2 angle BAC, maybe there's a cyclic relation here. Let me think of inversion. Reflecting A over EF to get A', then perhaps the circumcircle of A'EF is related to some fixed point through inversion.\n\nAlternatively, considering that angle EPF is twice angle BAC, and in triangle ABC, angle BAC is part of the original triangle. If we consider the circumcircle of ABC, then points related to angle conditions might lie on certain circles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed point is the orthocenter of ABC. If ABC is acute, the orthocenter lies inside. But how would that relate to A'EF's circumcircle?\n\nAlternatively, since PB and PC are tangent to the circumcircle of ABC, then P lies on the polar of BC with respect to the circumcircle. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the problem involves the reflection A', which is over EF. Since EF is a line moving with E and F but under the condition angle EPF = 2 angle BAC, perhaps the locus of A' as EF varies has some common point.\n\nAlternatively, since angle EPF = 2 angle BAC, maybe there's a relationship with the circumcircle of PEF and BAC. But perhaps using the fact that angle at P is twice angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed point is the circumcenter of ABC. Let's see: if O is the circumcenter of ABC, then maybe OA' is equal to OA, but since A' is reflection over EF, perhaps O lies on the circumcircle of A'EF. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the problem, since PB and PC are tangent to the circumcircle of ABC, then OP^2 = OB^2 = OC^2 (since tangents from P to the circle have equal length). So OP is equal to the circumradius. Wait, but O is the center, so OB is the radius R. Then PB is tangent, so PB^2 = OP^2 - OB^2. Wait, no. The length of the tangent from P to the circle is sqrt(OP^2 - R^2). But if PB is tangent, then PB = sqrt(OP^2 - R^2). But unless OP is some specific length.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me get back to the problem's assumptions and structure them properly.\n\nThe assumptions should list all conditions given, each as a separate line. So:\n\n- Triangle ABC is acute.\n- PB and PC are tangent to the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC.\n- Points E and F lie on lines AB and AC, respectively.\n- Angle ∠EPF is equal to twice angle ∠BAC.\n- Point P is inside triangle AEF.\n- A' is the reflection of point A over line EF.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the circumcircle of triangle A'EF passes through a fixed point.\n\nWait, the original problem states that \"the circumscribed circle of A'EF passes through a fixed point\". The fixed point here is presumably independent of the choice of E and F as long as they satisfy the given angle condition and P is inside AEF. So regardless of how E and F are moved along AB and AC (with the angle condition), the circumcircle of A'EF always goes through this fixed point.\n\nNow, to structure this as per the required format:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. Triangle ABC is acute.\n2. PB and PC are tangent lines to the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC.\n3. E is a point on line AB.\n4. F is a point on line AC.\n5. The measure of angle EPF is twice the measure of angle BAC.\n6. Point P is located inside triangle AEF.\n7. Point A' is the reflection of point A over line EF.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the circumscribed circle of triangle A'EF passes through a fixed point.\n\nEach assumption is now listed line by line, each addressing a single property or condition for one object. For example, the tangency of PB and PC is a separate condition applied to P. The positions of E and F are separate points on AB and AC. The angle condition is a separate line, and so on.\n\nI need to verify that each assumption is correctly parsed and none are missed. The problem mentions that PB and PC are tangent lines to the circumscribed circle (of ABC, as inferred). The reflection of A over EF is correctly stated as point A'. The angle EPF is twice angle BAC. P is inside AEF. All these are covered in the assumptions. The problem is to prove the circumcircle of A'EF passes through a fixed point. The fixed point is not specified, so it's part of the problem statement.\n\nYes, this should be the formatted problem.",
