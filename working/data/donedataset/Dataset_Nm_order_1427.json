    "Content": "Given a closed, convex, non-empty set $K\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^n$ the support function $h_K:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to (-\\infty,\\infty]$ is defined as\n$$h_K(y) := \\sup_{x\\in K} \\langle x,y\\rangle$$ It is easy to see that $h_K$ is convex, $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$-homogenuous and that all sublevel sets $\\{y \\mid h_K(y)\\leq C\\}$ are closed (in other words: $h_K$ is lower semicontinuous). I have several questions which I haven't been able to answer satisfactorily through google. Note that I'm interested in the case of general $K$ not just compact ones. Do these properties characterize support functions? There is an obvious way to define a convex set given such a function $h$ by setting $K:=\\{x \\mid \\forall y: \\langle x,y\\rangle \\leq h(y)\\}$ and obviously $h_K\\leq h$, but I cannot prove equality. Is there an description of $h_{K_1\\cap K_2}$ in terms of $h_{K_1}$ and $h_{K_2}$ similarly to the descriptions $h_{K_1+K_2} = h_{K_1}+h_{K_2}$, $h_{conv(K_1\\cup K_2)} = \\max\\{h_{K_1},h_{K_2}\\}$ ? I think that something like $h_{K_1\\cap K_2} = \\sup\\{h \\leq \\min\\{h_{K_1},h_{K_2}\\} \\mid h \\,\\text{convex}\\}$ might be true but I cannot prove it.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "1. Yes, this is true. This can be derived from the involutive property of the Legendre-Fenchel transform: if $f:\\mathbb R^n\\to (-\\infty,+\\infty]$ is a closed convex function, then $f^{**}=f$ (Theorem 12.2 in Rockafellar's Convex Analysis ). Recall that \n$$f^*(x) = \\sup\\{\\langle x,y\\rangle - f(y) : y\\in\\mathbb R^n\\}$$\nand a convex function is closed if its epigraph is. With every convex closed set $K$ we can associate a closed convex function $\\delta_K$ by letting $\\delta_K(x)=0$ when $x\\in K$ and $\\delta_K(x)=+\\infty$ otherwise. Observe that $\\delta_K^*$ is exactly $h_K$. Given $h$ as in your question, define $K= \\{x : \\langle x,y\\rangle \\le h(y) \\ \\forall y\\}$. Observe that $h^*(x)=0$ when $x\\in K$, because the supremum is attained by $y=0$. If $x\\notin K$, then there is $y$ such that $\\langle x,y\\rangle > h(y)$. Considering large multiples of such $y$, we conclude that $h^*(x)=\\infty$. Thus, $h^* = \\delta_K$. By the involutive property, $h=h^{**} = \\delta_K^* = h_K$. By the way, this result is  Theorem 13.2 in Rockafellar's book. 2. Yes, this is correct. Another way to state this fact: the epigraph of $h_{K_1\\cap K_2}$ is the convex hull of $\\operatorname{epi} h_{K_1} \\cup \\operatorname{epi} h_{K_2}$. To see this, observe that the epigraph of $h_K$ is determined by its intersection with the horizontal plane $z=1$. This intersection is nothing but $K^\\circ$, the polar of $K$. It remains to use the fact that $(K_1\\cap K_2)^\\circ  = \\operatorname{conv}(K_1^\\circ \\cup K_2^\\circ)$. See also Corollary 16.5.1 in Rockafellar's book.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking a few questions about support functions of convex sets. Let me see what each part is.\n\nFirst, the original question starts by defining the support function h_K(y) as the supremum of the inner product of x and y over all x in K, where K is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n. Then they mention that h_K is convex, positively homogeneous, and lower semicontinuous because the sublevel sets are closed.\n\nThe first question is whether these properties (convexity, positive homogeneity, lower semicontinuity) characterize support functions. The user tried to define a set K from such a function h by taking all x such that <x,y> ≤ h(y) for all y, and notes that h_K ≤ h but can't prove equality. So the problem here is to determine if those three properties are sufficient for a function to be the support function of some convex set.\n\nThe second question is about the support function of the intersection of two sets K1 and K2. They mention that for the Minkowski sum and the convex hull of the union, there are known expressions for the support functions. They propose a possible formula for h_{K1∩K2} as the supremum of all convex functions h that are ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}}, but they can't prove it. So the problem here is to find an expression for the support function of the intersection in terms of the support functions of K1 and K2.\n\nNow, I need to structure this according to the given format. The example given in the prompt had Assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Then the Problem is stated.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the user has two separate questions. But in the example, the problem was a single statement. However, the user instructions say to structure the problem as per the format. The example included assumptions that were perhaps from the original problem but maybe the user didn't list all. Wait, in the example, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's not in the original problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, but perhaps the example is illustrative of how to extract assumptions, but maybe it's an incorrect example. Anyway, the user wants us to process the current problem.\n\nLooking at the current problem:\n\nAssumptions for the first question: The function h is convex, h is R≥0-homogeneous, h is lower semicontinuous. Are these the properties that characterize support functions? So the problem is: Do these three properties characterize support functions of convex sets?\n\nFor the second question: Given K1 and K2 are closed, convex, non-empty sets. The problem is to describe h_{K1∩K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}, similar to the known results for Minkowski sum and convex hull of union. The user suggests a possible formula but can't prove it.\n\nBut according to the format, we need to list assumptions line by line, each about one property of one object. Then state the problem.\n\nSo for the first problem: The user is asking if the properties of convexity, positive homogeneity, and lower semicontinuity are sufficient for a function h to be the support function of some convex set K. So the assumptions here would be that h is a function with those three properties, and the problem is whether such h is the support function of some convex set.\n\nBut the user also mentions that when they define K via K = {x | for all y, <x,y> ≤ h(y)}, then h_K ≤ h, but can't prove equality. So perhaps the problem is to prove that under the given properties, h_K = h. So the assumptions would be h is convex, h is positively homogeneous, h is lower semicontinuous. Then the problem is to prove that h is the support function of the set K defined as above.\n\nFor the second problem: The assumptions are K1 and K2 are closed, convex, non-empty sets. The problem is to find an expression for h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}, similar to the known results for sum and convex hull of union.\n\nBut the user's example had multiple parts, but the format example only listed one problem. However, here the user has two separate questions. The format example combined them into one problem? Wait, no. The original example had a single problem. So perhaps in this case, we need to split into two separate problems? But the user's example combined all the assumptions into one. Alternatively, maybe structure each question as a separate problem with their own assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has two parts. But according to the instructions, the format should have Assumptions and then Problem. But the user's example has multiple assumptions listed line by line. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nTitle: What functions are support functions of convex sets\n\nQuestion: Given a closed, convex, non-empty set K ⊆ R^n, the support function h_K is defined as h_K(y) = sup_{x∈K} <x,y>. It's convex, R≥0-homogeneous, and lower semicontinuous. The questions are:\n\n1. Do these properties characterize support functions? (i.e., if h is convex, positively homogeneous, lsc, is there a convex K such that h = h_K?)\n\n2. Is there a description of h_{K1 ∩ K2} similar to the known ones for sum and convex hull?\n\nSo for the first problem, the assumptions would be h is a function from R^n to (-infty, ∞], h is convex, h is positively homogeneous, h is lower semicontinuous. Problem: Is h the support function of some closed, convex, non-empty set K?\n\nFor the second problem, assumptions: K1 and K2 are closed, convex, non-empty subsets of R^n. Problem: Describe h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}.\n\nBut the user's example structured a problem with assumptions and problem. Since the user's original post has two separate questions, maybe we should format each as separate problems.\n\nBut the user's example only has one problem. However, perhaps in the context of the current problem, the user wants both questions addressed. However, the original format in the example seems to take a single problem and list its assumptions. Therefore, perhaps each question should be its own entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to present both parts in one problem? But according to the example, it's one problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two questions are part of the same problem, but the user's instruction might expect each to be formatted separately. However, the user hasn't specified, but in their example, they took a problem and formatted it with assumptions and problem. Here, the original problem has two questions. So maybe each question is a separate problem. Let's proceed as such.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption:\nh: R^n → (-infty, ∞] is a function,\nh is convex,\nh is R_{≥0}-homogeneous,\nh is lower semicontinuous.\n\nProblem:\nIs h the support function of some closed, convex, non-empty set K?\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nDescribe h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second problem's assumptions are merged. But according to the example, each assumption is one line, one property applied to one object.\n\nWait, the example had:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nBut in the original problem, n was any integer. The example added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake, but it's illustrative. So in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. So maybe the user expects to extract the implicit assumptions from the problem.\n\nBut in the current case, the problem explicitly states that K is closed, convex, non-empty. So for the first question, the function h must satisfy convexity, homogeneity, lower semicontinuity. So the assumptions for the first question are those three properties of h.\n\nFor the second problem, the assumptions are that K1 and K2 are closed, convex, non-empty. So each assumption line would list those properties for each set.\n\nBut the problem is to describe h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}, so the user is asking for a formula.\n\nHence, structuring both as separate problems:\n\nFirst formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nh: R^n → (-infty, ∞] is a function,\nh is convex,\nh is R_{≥0}-homogeneous,\nh is lower semicontinuous.\n\nProblem:\nIs h the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K?\n\nSecond formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nDescribe h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem mentions \"note that I'm interested in the case of general K, not just compact ones,\" but the question is about general K. However, the original definition of K is closed, convex, non-empty. So the assumptions for K1 and K2 include being closed, convex, non-empty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's problem is split into two parts. So the answer should have two separate formatted problems. But according to the user's example, they took one problem and structured it. However, the user's current question has two questions. So perhaps the answer should include both formatted problems.\n\nBut looking at the example, the formatted problem only includes the problem and assumptions. So maybe each question is a separate problem, so each should be formatted separately.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's original question contains multiple questions, perhaps they want them listed in the same problem. But the example didn't have that. So maybe split into two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original problem, the user is asking two separate questions, so each should be formatted as a separate entry.\n\nBut according to the instructions, the task is to read the question on Math Stack Exchange, filter the unrelated information, and structure the problem into the given format. The example given was a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the user expects both parts to be included in one problem, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part is a separate problem.\n\nThe original question's title is \"What functions are support functions of convex sets\", which relates to the first question. The second question is about the support function of intersections. So maybe these are two separate problems.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. But perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem according to the format.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nFirst, the first question is: Do the properties of convexity, positive homogeneity, and lower semicontinuity characterize support functions? So the assumptions are the three properties of h. The problem is to prove that such h is the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set.\n\nSecond question: Describe h_{K1∩K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}. The assumptions are K1 and K2 are closed, convex, non-empty.\n\nBut according to the format, each formatted problem has Assumptions and Problem. Therefore, each question is a separate formatted problem.\n\nHence, the answer would have two formatted problems.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"structure that problem as the following format\" (singular). The original question has two questions. Therefore, perhaps the answer should have two formatted blocks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to include both as separate parts under one problem. But the example had one problem. It's unclear, but perhaps the intended way is to list each question as a separate formatted problem.\n\nSo the final answer should be two formatted problems:\n\nFirst:\n\nAssumption:\nh: R^n → (-infty, ∞] is a function,\nh is convex,\nh is R_{≥0}-homogeneous,\nh is lower semicontinuous.\n\nProblem:\nIs h the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K?\n\nSecond:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nDescribe h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem is stated as a command (Prove that...), so here the first problem is a yes/no question, but the user is asking for a proof of characterization. So perhaps the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that h is the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K\" given the assumptions. But the original user question is whether these properties characterize support functions, so it's a yes/no with proof.\n\nSimilarly, the second problem is to describe h_{K1∩K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}, with the given assumptions.\n\nBut the example had a problem statement starting with \"Prove that...\", so perhaps for the first problem, the problem statement is \"Prove that h is the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K\".\n\nBut the user's original first question is \"Do these properties characterize support functions?\" So maybe the problem is to determine whether the properties are sufficient, i.e., prove that any function with these properties is a support function.\n\nSo the first formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nh: R^n → (-infty, ∞] is a function,\nh is convex,\nh is R_{≥0}-homogeneous,\nh is lower semicontinuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that h is the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K.\n\nThe second formatted problem:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nFind a description of h_{K1 ∩ K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}.\n\nBut the user also proposed a possible formula involving the supremum of convex functions h ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}}, so maybe the problem is to prove that h_{K1∩K2} equals that supremum.\n\nBut in the user's question, they said they think something like that formula might be true but can't prove it. So perhaps the problem is to prove that h_{K1 ∩ K2} is equal to the supremum of all convex functions h that are ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}}.\n\nThus, the second problem's problem statement would be:\n\nProve that h_{K1 ∩ K2} = sup{h ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}} | h is convex}.\n\nBut in the user's question, they wrote: \"something like h_{K1∩K2} = sup{h ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}} | h convex} might be true...\" So the problem is to determine if this equality holds.\n\nTherefore, the second formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that h_{K1 ∩ K2} = sup{h ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}} | h is convex}.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is asking for a description similar to the known results, so maybe the problem is to find such a description, not necessarily the one they conjectured. However, since they proposed a specific form, perhaps that's the problem.\n\nBut the original problem has two separate questions. To follow the format, each question should be a separate entry.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer would have two blocks:\n\nFirst block:\n\nAssumption:\nh: R^n → (-infty, ∞] is a function,\nh is convex,\nh is R_{≥0}-homogeneous,\nh is lower semicontinuous.\n\nProblem:\nProve that h is the support function of a closed, convex, non-empty set K.\n\nSecond block:\n\nAssumption:\nK1 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n,\nK2 is a closed, convex, non-empty subset of R^n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that h_{K1 ∩ K2} = sup{h ≤ min{h_{K1}, h_{K2}} | h is convex}.\n\nBut wait, in the user's question, the second part is asking for a description, not necessarily to prove their conjecture. So perhaps the problem is to describe h_{K1∩K2} in terms of h_{K1} and h_{K2}. The user suggests a possible formula but isn't sure, so the problem is to find such a description.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement is direct. So perhaps the problem should be stated as the user's conjecture.\n\nAlternatively, leave it as \"Describe h_{K1 ∩ K2}...\".\n\nBut the user's example had the problem statement as \"Prove that...\". So perhaps for the second part, the problem is to prove the conjecture.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problems would be as above.",
