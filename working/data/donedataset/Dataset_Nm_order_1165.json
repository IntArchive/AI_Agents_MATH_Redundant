    "Content": "Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $\\operatorname{char}k=0$, $F$ be an irreducible homogeneous polynomial of degree$>1$ in $k[X,Y,Z]$, and $H=\\det\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}F_{xx}&F_{xy}&F_{xz}\\\\F_{yx}&F_{yy}&F_{yz}\\\\F_{zx}&F_{zy}&F_{zz}\\end{array}\\right)$. Make more clear, in this setting, that $H\\neq 0$ is always true. Why is $H$ not 0?\n  Is there a pure algebraic proof of this ? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The question makes sense in any number of variables $n$. As pointed out by John M in the comments, Hesse conjectured that $H\\equiv 0$ if and only if the integral variety $V(F)$ defined by $F$ is a cone (i.e. after a suitable linear transformation, $F$ depends only on $n-1$ variables). This condition is clearly sufficient (note that for $n\\le 3$, $F$ irreducible implies that $V(F)$ can't be a cone unless $\\deg F=1$). Gordan and Noether proved the conjecture for $n\\le 4$ and showed it is false for $n\\ge 5$. For $n=3$ (your situation), there is a down-to-earth and purely algebraic proof in a paper of Christoph Lossen http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~lossen/download/Lossen003/Lossen003.ps.gz (the idea of dual variety appears in the proof but is not explicitely named). In the preprint pointed out by John M (now published in Connect. Math. 60 (2009)), there is a more geometric proof (easy consequence of  Proposition 1.6 attributed to F. Zak).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is asking why the Hessian of an irreducible polynomial isn't zero. The question body provides more context: the field k is algebraically closed with characteristic zero, F is an irreducible homogeneous polynomial of degree greater than 1 in k[X,Y,Z], and H is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of F. The user is asking why H is not zero and if there's a pure algebraic proof.\n\nSo, the main task is to extract assumptions and the problem statement. Let me list the assumptions one by one. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nFirst assumption: k is an algebraically closed field. That's a property of the field.\n\nSecond assumption: The characteristic of k is 0. That's another property of the field, so separate from being algebraically closed.\n\nThird assumption: F is an irreducible polynomial. This applies to F.\n\nFourth assumption: F is homogeneous. Also applies to F.\n\nFifth assumption: The degree of F is greater than 1. Again, a separate condition about F.\n\nProblem statement: Prove that the Hessian determinant H is not zero. Alternatively, as the user phrased it, \"Why is H not 0?\" and they also ask for a pure algebraic proof, but the main problem is showing H ≠ 0.\n\nWait, the example given in the format had the problem restated clearly. So I need to structure the problem part as \"Prove that H ≠ 0\" where H is defined as the determinant of the Hessian matrix of F.\n\nI need to make sure all assumptions are listed. Let me check again:\n\n- k algebraically closed: yes.\n\n- char k = 0: yes.\n\n- F is irreducible: yes.\n\n- F is homogeneous: yes.\n\n- deg F >1: yes.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption, each applying to one object (either k or F). The problem is to show H ≠ 0. The user also mentioned making it clearer in this setting that H ≠0 is always true. So the problem is to prove that under these conditions, the Hessian determinant is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those five assumptions, each on their own line, and the problem statement as proving H ≠ 0.",
