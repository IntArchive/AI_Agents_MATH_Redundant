    "Content": "It is section $4.4$, exercise number $5$. It says the following: Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Show that $f(x)=x^p-x-a$ has no multiple roots and that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$ if and only if $a\\neq c^p-c$ for any $c\\in F$. $\\bf{Proof:}$ First of all we note that $f'(x)=-1$, hence $\\gcd(f,f')=1$, and we see that $f$ contains no multiple roots. Secondly, assume that $a=c^p-c$ for some $c\\in F$. Then we have that $$x^p-x-a=x^p-x-(c^p-c)=x^p-c^p-x+c=(x-c)^p-(x-c)=(x-c)((x-c)^{p-1}-1)$$Hence $f(x)$ is reducible. (That is, we have proven that if $f$ is irreducible then $a\\neq c^p-c$ for any $c\\in F$). For the converse, I was trying to do something along the lines consider $E$ to be a splitting field for $f(x)$. Then, let $b$ be a root of $f(x)$ in $E$. This $b$ satisfies the identity $b^p-b=a$, hence I would like to show the existence of some root $b\\in E$ to be actually in our field $F$. This is were I got stuck.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $E$ be a splitting field of $f(x)=x^p-x-a$ over $F$. Let $b\\in E $ be a root of $f$. Then for any $n=1,2,\\ldots,(p-1)$, the element $b+n$ is also a root of $F$, because\n$$f(b+n)=(b+n)^p-(b+n)-a=(b^p-b-a)+(n^p-n)=0+0=0$$\n(to be precise, $b+n$ is just shorthand for $b+(n\\cdot 1_F)$). Because $f$ is of degree $p$, we've now found all the roots. Clearly, we have that $E=F(b)$. Let $g(x)\\in F[x]$ be the minimal polynomial for $b$ over $F$. Note that $g\\mid f$ because $f(b)=0$. Since $E=F(b)$, we have that $[E:F]=\\deg(g)$. Now note that $g(x-n)$ is the minimal polynomial for $b+n$ over $F$; if any monic irreducible polynomial $h(x)\\in F[x]$ with $\\deg(h)<\\deg(g)$ had $h(b+n)=0$, then $h(x+n)$ would have $b$ as a root and still have smaller degree than $g$, contradicting the fact that $g$ is $b$'s minimal polynomial. Let the factorization of $f$ into monic irreducibles be $f=q_1 q_2\\cdots q_r$ (there can't be any repeated factors, because that would lead to repeated roots). Each of the $q_i$ has as a root at least one of the $b+k$, and therefore (being monic and irreducible) is its minimal polynomial. This implies that $\\deg(q_i)=\\deg(g)$ for all $i$, and therefore $\\deg(g)\\mid \\deg(f)=p$. Thus, either $\\deg(g)=p$, hence $f=g$ is irreducible, or, $\\deg(g)=1$, hence $[E:F]=1$, hence $b\\in F$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem is from Jacobson's Basic Algebra, Volume I, Section 4.4, Exercise 5. The task is to show two things about the polynomial f(x) = x^p - x - a over a field F of characteristic p: first, that it has no multiple roots, and second, that it's irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ≠ c^p - c for any c in F. \n\nStarting with the first part: proving no multiple roots. The user mentioned that the derivative f'(x) is -1. Since the field has characteristic p, the derivative of x^p is px^(p-1), which is 0 because p is the characteristic, so f'(x) = -1. The gcd of f and f' would then be gcd(x^p - x - a, -1), which is 1 because any constant polynomial (other than zero) is coprime with any non-constant polynomial. Therefore, since the gcd is 1, f(x) has no multiple roots. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part is the if and only if statement for irreducibility. The user already showed one direction: if a = c^p - c for some c in F, then f(x) factors as (x - c)((x - c)^{p-1} - 1), hence reducible. So the converse needs to be proven: if f(x) is reducible, then there exists some c in F such that a = c^p - c. Alternatively, if a ≠ c^p - c for any c in F, then f(x) is irreducible.\n\nThe user attempted to consider a splitting field E of f(x) and take a root b in E. They noted that b^p - b = a. The idea might be to show that if f(x) is reducible, then one of its roots is in F, leading to a contradiction unless a can be expressed as c^p - c. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose f(x) is reducible over F. Then it can be factored into two polynomials of lower degree, say f(x) = g(x)h(x), where both g and h have degree at least 1. Since the degree of f is p, which is a prime number, one of the factors must be degree 1. So, there exists a root of f(x) in F. Let that root be c ∈ F. Then c^p - c - a = 0, so a = c^p - c. But this contradicts the assumption that a ≠ c^p - c for any c ∈ F. Hence, if no such c exists, f(x) cannot have a linear factor, hence must be irreducible.\n\nWait, but the user's original question is about the converse direction. The user seems stuck at showing that if a is not of the form c^p - c, then f is irreducible. The approach would be to assume f is reducible and then show that a must equal c^p - c for some c. As I just thought, if f is reducible, since it's degree p, which is prime, then it must have a linear factor, hence a root in F, leading to a = c^p - c. Therefore, the converse holds.\n\nBut maybe the user is confused about the splitting field part. Let me check. The user considered E as the splitting field and a root b in E. They want to show that if a is not in the form c^p - c, then the root b is not in F, but perhaps how does that help in proving irreducibility? The key point is that if f splits into linear factors over E, but if F doesn't contain any root, then f is irreducible over F. Wait, but reducibility over F would require at least one root in F, given the prime degree. Because if it factors into lower degrees, one of them has to be degree 1. Therefore, the converse is established by contrapositive: if f is reducible, then it has a root in F, hence a = c^p - c. Therefore, if a is not of that form, f is irreducible.\n\nThe user might have gotten stuck trying to use the splitting field approach, but actually, the argument can be made more directly via contrapositive without needing to go to the splitting field. So the crucial step is recognizing that reducibility implies a linear factor, hence a root in F, hence a = c^p - c. Therefore, if such c doesn't exist, the polynomial must be irreducible.\n\nSo the problem's structure would involve the assumptions about the field's characteristic, the form of the polynomial, and the condition on a. The problem then asks to show two things: no multiple roots and the irreducibility condition. However, according to the user's example, they might want to separate the assumptions and the problem statement. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal problem statement: Show that f(x) = x^p - x - a has no multiple roots and that f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ≠ c^p - c for any c ∈ F.\n\nThe user structured their example problem by listing each assumption line by line. So for this problem, the assumptions would include:\n\n- F is a field.\n- The characteristic of F is p (a prime).\n- a is an element of F.\n- The polynomial is f(x) = x^p - x - a.\n\nThen the problem is to show two things: no multiple roots and the irreducibility condition.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they listed assumptions as specific conditions. For instance, in their example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are that F is a field of characteristic p, and a is an element of F. The problem is to show the two properties.\n\nBut the user's example shows that assumptions should list each property applied to one object. So here:\n\nAssumptions:\n- F is a field,\n- The characteristic of F is a prime p,\n- a is an element of F,\n- f(x) = x^p - x - a is a polynomial in F[x].\n\nProblem: Show that f(x) has no multiple roots and that f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ≠ c^p - c for any c ∈ F.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user's formatted problem only included the problem statement after listing the assumptions. The original problem had two parts: show no multiple roots and the irreducibility condition. However, the user's example filtered the original problem to focus on the divisibility by 91, adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7. In the current case, the problem is structured as per the original question but needs to fit into the specified format.\n\nLooking back at the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for A(n). The user formatted it with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem statement was to prove divisibility by 91. But in the actual problem, the original question didn't mention n being divisible by 7; the user added that as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is part of a different problem where they had to consider n divisible by 7? Hmm, perhaps there was a miscommunication in the example. But regardless, following the instructions, the task is to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nGiven the current problem: \"Let F be a field of characteristic p. Show that f(x)=x^p−x−a has no multiple roots and that f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a≠c^p−c for any c∈F.\"\n\nThe assumptions here are:\n\n- F is a field,\n- The characteristic of F is a prime p,\n- a is an element of F,\n- f(x) = x^p - x - a.\n\nThe problem is to show two things: no multiple roots and the irreducibility condition. However, the user's example included only the problem statement after the assumptions. But here, the problem has two parts. However, the user's example only had the problem statement, so perhaps we need to list all the assumptions and then state the problem as given.\n\nTherefore, formatted as per instructions:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\nThe characteristic of F is a prime p,\na is an element of F,\nf(x) = x^p - x - a is a polynomial in F[x].\n\nProblem:\nShow that f(x) has no multiple roots and that f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ≠ c^p - c for any c ∈ F.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Here, the field F has characteristic p, which is one condition. Each bullet point should be a single condition. So:\n\nAssumption:\nF is a field,\nF has characteristic p (a prime),\na is an element of F,\nf(x) = x^p - x - a.\n\nProblem:\nProve that f(x) has no multiple roots and that f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ≠ c^p - c for any c ∈ F.\n\nThat seems appropriate. Each assumption is one line, each addressing one property applied to one object. The problem statement is as given.",
