    "Content": "I am having a difficulty setting up the proof of the fact that two bases of a vector space have the same cardinality for the infinite-dimensional case. In particular, let $V$ be a vector space over a field $K$ and let $\\left\\{v_i\\right\\}_{i \\in I}$ be a basis where $I$ is infinite countable. Let $\\left\\{u_j\\right\\}_{j \\in J}$ be another basis. Then $J$ must be infinite countable as well. Any ideas on how to approach the proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "In spirit , the proof is very similar to the proof that two finite bases must have the same cardinality: express each vector in one basis in terms of the vectors in the other basis, and leverage that to show the cardinalities must be equal, by using the fact that the \"other\" basis must span and be linearly independent. Suppose that $\\{v_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ and $\\{u_j\\}_{j\\in J}$ are two infinite bases for $V$ . For each $i\\in I$ , $v_i$ is in the linear span of $\\{u_j\\}_{j\\in J}$ . Therefore, there exists a finite subset $J_i\\subseteq J$ such that $v_i$ is a linear combination of the vectors $\\{u_j\\}_{j\\in J_i}$ (since a linear combination involves only finitely many vectors with nonzero coefficient). Therefore, $V=\\mathrm{span}(\\{v_i\\}_{i\\in I}) \\subseteq \\mathrm{span}\\{u_j\\}_{j\\in \\cup J_i}$ . Since no proper subset of $\\{u_j\\}_{j\\in J}$ can span $V$ , it follows that $J = \\mathop{\\cup}\\limits_{i\\in I}J_i$ . Now use this to show that $|J|\\leq |I|$ , and a symmetric argument to show that $|I|\\leq |J|$ . Note. The argument I have in mind in the last line involves some (simple) cardinal arithmetic, but it is enough that at least some form of the Axiom of Choice may be needed in its full generality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to format the given problem according to the user's specifications. The original question is about proving that two bases of a vector space have the same cardinality in the infinite-dimensional case. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The user mentioned that each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the problem statement.\n\nThe vector space V is over a field K. That's one assumption. Then, there's a basis {v_i} with index set I, which is infinite countable. That gives two separate assumptions: one about the existence of the basis {v_i} and another about I being infinite countable. Similarly, there's another basis {u_j} with index set J. The problem states that J must also be infinite countable, but that's the conclusion to prove, not an assumption. So the assumptions here are the existence of the second basis {u_j} and that J is another index set. Wait, but the problem doesn't state any prior conditions on J. The user's example included assumptions about the problem's given conditions. So the problem's given conditions are:\n\n- V is a vector space over field K.\n- {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis of V.\n- I is infinite countable.\n- {u_j}_{j ∈ J} is another basis of V.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that J is also infinite countable. So those four points are the assumptions. Each one is a separate line. Let me check if each applies to one object. \n\n1. V is a vector space over a field K. (Applies to V)\n2. {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis of V. (Applies to {v_i} and I)\nWait, but the format says each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe splitting them further. For example:\n\n- V is a vector space over field K.\n- {v_i} is a basis of V, indexed by set I.\n- The set I is infinite and countable.\n- {u_j} is a basis of V, indexed by set J.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that J is infinite countable. So the assumptions are:\n\n- V is a vector space over a field K.\n- {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis for V.\n- I is an infinite countable set.\n- {u_j}_{j ∈ J} is a basis for V.\n\nThen the problem is to show that J is also infinite countable. So the formatted version should list these four assumptions. Let me check the example again. In the example, the assumptions were \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" But here, the problem states that both bases exist, and I is infinite countable. So the user's instruction says to filter unrelated information. The original question mentions the difficulty in setting up the proof, but the task is to structure the problem, not the solution. So the problem part is \"Prove that J is infinite countable.\" \n\nWait, the original problem says \"Then J must be infinite countable as well.\" So the problem is to prove that J is infinite countable. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumptions:\n- V is a vector space over a field K.\n- {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis of V.\n- I is an infinite countable set.\n- {u_j}_{j ∈ J} is a basis of V.\n\nProblem: Prove that J is an infinite countable set.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"two bases of a vector space have the same cardinality in the infinite-dimensional case.\" The user's example for the previous problem included the divisibility by 7, but in the Math Stack Exchange question, the user is focusing on the case where one basis is countably infinite, and they need to prove the other is too. However, the general theorem is that all bases of a vector space have the same cardinality, but here the specific case is when one basis is infinite countable. So the assumptions should reflect that. Therefore, the assumptions are as above. Each line is a separate condition. Let me check again:\n\nEach assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. V is a vector space over field K. (Applies to V)\n2. The set {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis for V. (Applies to {v_i} and I)\nWait, but maybe split into two? No, because \"is a basis for V\" is a property of the set {v_i} and its indexing set I. But the format says each assumption line is about one object. So perhaps:\n\n- V is a vector space over a field K.\n- {v_i}_{i ∈ I} is a basis of V.\n- The index set I is infinite and countable.\n- {u_j}_{j ∈ J} is a basis of V.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. Yes, each line is about one object: V, the basis {v_i}, the index set I, the other basis {u_j}. So that should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have those assumptions and the problem is to prove J is infinite countable.",
