    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is a special case of Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem , see e.g. Theorem 2.3.15 in Engelking's General Topology: If $d(X_s)\\leq \\alpha\\geq\\aleph_0$ for every $s\\in S$ and $|S|\\leq 2^\\alpha$ , then $d(\\prod X_s)\\leq\\alpha$ . The $d(X)$ denotes the density of the topological space $X$ ,\nwhich is defined as $$d(X)=\\min\\{|D|; D\\text{ is a dense subset of }X\\}+\\aleph_0.$$ I.e., $d(X)$ is the cardinality of a smallest dense subset, but if there is a finite dense subset, we put $d(X)=\\aleph_0$ . This means that a topological space is separable if and only if $d(X)=\\aleph_0$ . Some further references are given at Planetmath . Wikipedia article on separable space mentions Theorem 16.4c in Willard's General Topology as a reference for the special case you're asking about. A proof of this theorem can be found at in this post from Ask a Topologist. ( Wayback Machine ; The post was written by Henno Brandsma .) This theorem can  be used to show that there is an independent family on $\\mathbb N$ of cadinality $\\mathfrak c$ ; see Stephan Geschke 's MO post and paper .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving that the product of 𝔠-many separable spaces is separable, and also constructing a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions a product of separable spaces where the index set has cardinality 𝔠. Each separable space is a topological space, right? So each individual space in the product is separable. Also, the index set's cardinality is the continuum, which is 𝔠.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned their textbook says it's possible but gives no references. So the assumptions here would be that each topological space in the product is separable, and the index set has cardinality 𝔠. There's no restriction mentioned on the spaces beyond being separable, so each one is just a separable topological space. Also, the product is over 𝔠-many such spaces.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this product is separable. Additionally, the user is interested in a less general case: constructing a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ. But the main problem seems to be the general case. \n\nLet me check the example given. The example listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each topological space in the product is separable.\n2. The index set of the product has cardinality 𝔠.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that the product of these spaces is separable. Also, the second part about ℝ^ℝ is a specific case, but maybe that's part of the problem statement? The user says \"In a less general setting...\" so perhaps that's a separate part of the problem. Hmm, the original question has two parts: the general case and the specific case of ℝ^ℝ. But the example given in the problem structured only the main problem. Maybe I need to decide whether to include both parts or not. The user's example included the problem as given, so perhaps here the problem is both proving the general statement and constructing the dense set in ℝ^ℝ. But wait, the user's original question says \"My textbook says it is possible but gives no references. Any suggestions how to prove this statement? In a less general setting, I would also be interested...\" So the main problem is the general case, and the specific case is a related question. But according to the instructions, I need to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem. So perhaps the problem is to prove that the product of 𝔠-many separable spaces is separable. The ℝ^ℝ part is another problem, but maybe the user wants it included. Wait, the original problem has two parts. The user might want both parts structured. But in the example, the problem was a single statement. Let me check the example again. The example had the problem as \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So here, the original problem has two parts: the general product space and ℝ^ℝ. But maybe the user wants both parts in the problem statement. However, the example didn't split into sub-problems. So perhaps the problem is the general one, and the ℝ^ℝ is a specific instance. Alternatively, the user might have intended both parts. Let me read the original question again: \"I already figured out how to show that the countable product of separable topological spaces is separable, but I'm out of ideas when the index set has cardinality of 𝔠. My textbook says it is possible but gives no references. Any suggestions how to prove this statement? In a less general setting, I would also be interested to see how a dense countable set is constructed to ℝ^ℝ.\" So the main problem is the general case (product with index set 𝔠), and the ℝ^ℝ is a specific case. But how should I structure this? The problem statement should probably include both. Maybe the problem is: \"Prove that the product of 𝔠-many separable topological spaces is separable. Additionally, construct a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ.\" But the original question doesn't explicitly state that ℝ^ℝ is a product of 𝔠-many copies of ℝ. Since ℝ has cardinality 𝔠, but the index set here is also 𝔠. So ℝ^ℝ is indeed a product of 𝔠-many separable spaces (since ℝ is separable). So maybe the second part is a specific instance of the general problem. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking both for the general proof and for the specific example. So perhaps the problem should be split into two parts. But according to the format, the problem is a single statement. Alternatively, the problem could be presented as two separate problems. Wait, the user's example had a single problem. So maybe the main problem is the general case, and the specific case is an additional part. However, the user's instructions say to structure the given problem (from Math Stack Exchange) into the format. So perhaps the problem part includes both: Prove that the product of 𝔠-many separable topological spaces is separable, and construct a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ. Alternatively, since the user says \"In a less general setting...\", maybe the problem is the general case, and the ℝ^ℝ is a specific instance, but perhaps the problem part can include both. However, the example given in the problem had a single problem statement. Maybe the user intended that the problem part is the general case, and the ℝ^ℝ is a follow-up. But the way the original question is written, the user is asking for both. Hmm, maybe I should follow the original problem's structure. The problem as stated in the original question is to prove the general statement and also to construct the dense set in ℝ^ℝ. So the formatted problem should include both. Let me see.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Each topological space in the product is separable.\n- The index set of the product has cardinality 𝔠.\n\nProblem: Prove that the product of 𝔠-many separable topological spaces is separable. Additionally, construct a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ.\n\nWait, but in the example, assumptions were about the objects in the problem. Here, the assumptions are about the spaces being separable and the index set size. So each assumption is one property. So the two assumptions would be:\n\n1. Each topological space in the product is separable.\n2. The product is taken over an index set of cardinality 𝔠.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that this product is separable, and also construct a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ.\n\nAlternatively, the second part about ℝ^ℝ might be under the same problem or a separate problem. But since the user mentions both in the original question, I think including both in the problem statement is appropriate. However, the example given only had one problem. Maybe in this case, the problem is the general one, and the specific case is a separate problem, but the user combined them. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"My textbook says it is possible but gives no references. Any suggestions how to prove this statement? In a less general setting, I would also be interested to see how a dense countable set is constructed to ℝ^ℝ.\" So the primary problem is the general case, and the specific case is a secondary request. So perhaps the problem part is: \"Prove that the product of 𝔠-many separable topological spaces is separable. Additionally, construct a dense countable set in ℝ^ℝ.\" That seems to capture both parts. Alternatively, maybe the second part is a separate problem, but the user included it in the same question. In any case, following the original problem's structure, I should include both parts in the problem statement. So the formatted problem would have the two assumptions listed and the problem as mentioned. \n\nLet me verify the assumptions again. The product is of separable spaces, each space is separable. The index set has cardinality 𝔠. So those are the two assumptions. The problem is to prove the product is separable. The specific case of ℝ^ℝ is an example where the index set is ℝ (which has cardinality 𝔠), and each factor is ℝ, which is separable. So constructing a dense countable set there is part of the problem. Therefore, the problem statement includes both parts. So the final formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nEach topological space in the product is separable,\nThe product is taken over an index set of cardinality 𝔠.\nProblem: \nProve that the product of 𝔠-many separable topological spaces is separable. Additionally, construct a dense countable set in $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{R}}$.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was a single statement. Maybe here, the problem is two parts. However, the user's example had a single problem. Perhaps the second part is considered part of the same problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is the general case, and the specific case is an example. But the user explicitly asks for the dense set construction. So perhaps the problem is to do both. Hence, the formatted problem includes both. But I need to check if there are any other assumptions for the specific case. For ℝ^ℝ, each factor is ℝ, which is separable. The index set is ℝ, which has cardinality 𝔠. So the same assumptions apply. Therefore, the problem includes both parts under the same assumptions. Hence, the formatted problem is as above. I think that's correct.",
