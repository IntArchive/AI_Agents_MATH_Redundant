    "Content": "Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. How to prove that for any closed $A$ a function $d(x,A)$ is continuous - I know that it is even Lipschitz continuous, but I have a problem with the proof: \n$$\n|d(x,a) - d(y,a)| \\leq d(x,y)\n$$\nfor any $a\\in A$ - but we cannot just replace it by $|d(x,A) - d(y,A)|\\leq d(x,y)$ since the minimum (or infimum in general) can be attained in different points $a\\in A$ for $x$ and $y$, so we only have that\n$$\n|d(x,A)-d(y,A)|\\leq d(x,y)+\\sup\\limits_{a,b\\in A}d(a,b)\n$$\nwhich does not mean continuity.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "If $A = X$ (or if $\\overline{A} = X$) then $d(\\cdot,A) = 0$ and there's nothing to prove. If $A$ is empty, the usual conventions in the infimum yield $d(\\cdot,\\emptyset) = \\infty$ and Lipschitz continuity doesn't really make sense. However a constant function is certainly continuous. So, assume that $\\emptyset \\neq A$ and let $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$. Choose $a\\in A$ such that $d(x,a) \\leq d(x,A) + \\varepsilon$. Then the triangle inequality yields $d(y,A) - d(x,A) \\leq d(y,a) - d(x,a) + \\varepsilon \\leq d(y,x) + \\varepsilon$. By symmetry we get $|d(x,A) - d(y,A)| \\leq d(x,y) + \\varepsilon$ and the desired result follows because $\\varepsilon$ was arbitrary. Note that I didn't use that $A$ is closed. Update: Alternatively, you can choose Zarrax's way and permute two steps in this paragraph and make the argument nicer by getting rid of the explicit mentioning of $\\varepsilon$ or appeal to the valuable general result mentioned by Didier. If $A$ is non-empty and not dense, i.e., $\\overline{A} \\neq X$ then $1$ is in fact the best Lipschitz constant. Indeed, there are $x$ and $r\\gt0$ such that $B_r(x) \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset$, so $d(x,A) \\geq r \\gt 0$. For every $\\varepsilon \\gt 0$ we can find $a \\in A$ such that $d(x,a) \\leq (1+\\varepsilon)d(x,A)$. But then $|d(a,A) - d(x,A)| = d(x,A)\\geq \\frac{1}{1+\\varepsilon} d(x,a)$ and the claim follows. For a closely related thread, see here .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that the function mapping a point x to its distance from a closed set A (d(x,A)) is continuous in a metric space (X,d). The user mentions they know it's Lipschitz continuous but are having trouble with the proof, especially regarding the infimum aspect.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition applied to one object. So, for this problem, the metric space (X,d) is given, A is a closed subset of X, and the function in question is d(x,A). The problem is to prove the continuity of this function.\n\nWait, the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem here, the user doesn't specify any such condition. The problem is general for any closed set A in a metric space. So the assumptions should be that (X,d) is a metric space, A is a closed subset of X, and the function d(x,A) is defined as the infimum of distances from x to points in A. But the user hasn't explicitly stated all these in the question. Wait, the question says \"for any closed A\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- (X, d) is a metric space.\n- A is a closed subset of X.\n- The function is defined as x ↦ d(x, A).\n\nThese are the key assumptions. The problem is to prove this function is continuous. The user's confusion comes from handling the infimum in the distance function and the step where the Lipschitz condition is derived, particularly why the usual approach for single points (using the triangle inequality) doesn't directly apply when taking infima over a set A. But according to the problem statement, the main task is to prove continuity, which is the core problem.\n\nSo, structuring this into the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n1. (X, d) is a metric space.\n2. A is a closed subset of X.\n3. The function is defined as x ↦ d(x, A), where d(x, A) = inf_{a ∈ A} d(x, a).\n\nProblem: Prove that the function x ↦ d(x, A) is continuous.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more general. However, the user's question doesn't mention any additional constraints, so the closedness of A and the metric space structure are the main assumptions. The closedness of A might not even be necessary for the continuity, but the user's original problem states \"for any closed A\", so we need to include that as an assumption. Wait, actually, the distance function to a set is always continuous regardless of whether the set is closed or not. But the user specifically mentions \"for any closed A\", so perhaps in their context, A is closed. So the assumption should include that A is closed.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user included that A is closed because they think it's necessary, but actually, the distance function is continuous even if A isn't closed. However, since the problem states \"for any closed A\", we have to take that as given. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- Let (X, d) be a metric space.\n- A is a closed subset of X.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the function x ↦ d(x, A) is continuous.\n\nI think that's sufficient. The example from the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, that wasn't stated. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That might have been an error. So maybe in this case, the user's example had a mistake, but we need to follow the actual problem here.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is: \"Prove that for any closed A, a function d(x,A) is continuous\". So the key assumptions are:\n\n1. (X, d) is a metric space.\n2. A is a closed subset of X.\n\nProblem: Prove that the function x ↦ d(x, A) is continuous.\n\nHowever, the fact that A is closed may not be necessary for the continuity of d(x, A), but since the problem states \"for any closed A\", we must include that as an assumption. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would have these two assumptions. But wait, the example seems to have added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original example problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, in the current problem, we shouldn't add assumptions not present in the original question unless necessary. However, the original question here explicitly mentions \"for any closed A\", so \"A is closed\" is part of the problem's condition. So the assumptions should include that A is closed. But also, the metric space (X, d) is given. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$(X, d)$ is a metric space,\n$A$ is a closed subset of $X$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the function $x \\mapsto d(x, A)$ is continuous.\n\nWait, but the original question's title is \"Continuity of the function x↦d(x,A) on a metric space\", and the problem statement says \"for any closed A\". So the key points are the metric space, A being closed, and the function being d(x,A). Therefore, the assumptions should list those. The fact that A is closed is part of the problem's condition. So yes, the formatted problem should have those assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$(X, d)$ is a metric space,\n$A$ is a closed subset of $X$.\nProblem:\nProve that the function $x \\mapsto d(x,A)$ is continuous.\n###",
