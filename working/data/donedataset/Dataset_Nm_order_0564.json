    "Content": "I'm currently learning calculus (high school senior), and I am not comfortable with the idea that the limit of the sums of rectangles actually converges to the area under the curve. I know it looks like it does, but how do we know for sure?  Couldn't the tiny errors beneath/over the curve accumulate as we add more and more rectangles? What's troubling me is the whole Pi = 4 thing with the staircase approximating a circle pointwise, and how it's wrong and the perimeter of the staircase shape does not approach the circumference of the circle, even though pointwise it does approach a circle. So how are the increasingly many, increasingly small errors in Riemann sums any different? How do we know the error in each step decreases faster than the number of errors increases? I would really like to see a proof of this. Thanks so much!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This actually is a very good question and something that really takes a two-prong answer to fully do it justice. PART 1. You are right to be skeptical and, I'd say, this is yet another of those times where that the \"standard\" maths curriculum and expositions do a really great job of making something easy, hard. You should trust your gut here, not your teacher. The answer is simple: no, you cannot \"prove\" this, unless you have an independent formal definition of \"area\" that is separate from the Riemann integral and comprehensive enough to handle these situations on its own. Such a definition can be made: it's called Lebesgue Measure , but it takes a bit more mathematical machinery than is available at this point in exposition to make it cook. Basically, Lebesgue measure is a function that takes a single input argument which is an entire set of points on the plane, i.e. $S$ , interpreted as a solid area and not merely the boundary, and tells you its area, $\\mu(S)$ . This $S$ would be, in your case, the solid plane figure that is colored in on the graphs in your calculus textbook as being the \"area under the curve\". There is no integrals involved in its definition though, as I'd say, we'd need to expose a considerable amount of new machinery to build this. But if you do that, then take my word that you can prove that $$\\mu(S) = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\ dx$$ where the right hand is a Riemann integral and the $S$ is as I described for this particular situation, when said Riemann integral exists. ADD: As @Paramanand Singh mentions in the comments, there are simpler ways to define the area that may be more digestible at this point, though they do not cover as many cases as the Lebesgue measure. The Borel measure and Jordan pseudo-measure are two such options and I could attempt to describe them here if you wish or, you could ask another question in the vein of \"What is a simple, integral-free definition of the area of a complicated plane figure that is digestible at or near the level of introductory calculus?\" and I could then answer it with one or both of these. PART 2. This, of course, leads one to what a better way to introduce the integral should be, given we cannot at this stage do the necessary proof. And moreover, even if we could, then it would lead one to scratch one's head as to just why exactly we care to be creating this idea of \"Riemann integral\" in the first place when we already have a perfectly-good working construct for area. And so, what I'd say is that a superior approach is to say that the Riemann integral is an explicit method to reconstruct a function from its derivative and, to make this clearer, we also need a better intuitive understanding of what a \"derivative\" means beyond the \"tangent line\" business that, while actually not bad at all, is itself also ruined by a poor explanation, too and which I could add still more details to get into, but I want to try and keep focus on the problem at hand. As Deane Yang mentioned in what was one of the posts that had a great influence in shaping my present attitude towards maths and especially maths education, here: a better intuitive model for the \"derivative\" is that it is a kind of \"sensitivity measurement\": if I say that the derivative of a real-valued function of a real variable, $f$ , has the value at the point $x$ of $f'(x)$ , what that means intuitively is that if I \"wiggle\" $x$ back and forth a little bit, i.e. $\\Delta x$ , back and forth about this value, and I watch then the output value of $f$ , i.e. $f(x)$ , as though $f(x)$ were some instrument with a readout and $x$ a dial we could turn back and forth, then this $f(x)$ will likewise \"wiggle\" some other amount, i.e. $\\Delta y$ , and that $$\\Delta y \\approx f'(x)\\ \\Delta x$$ provided $\\Delta x$ is small - the accuracy of the approximation becoming as good as we like it if we make $\\Delta x$ suitably smaller than whatever value we've been using so far: hence why we need to pass to a limit, a concept that, once more, can use some further elucidation. Or, to turn it around, $f'(x)$ is the \"best\" number to represent how much the output changes proportionally to the input, so long as we keep the input change small enough. The Riemann integral, then, is the answer to this question: Give me a procedure that, if we are first given the derivative , $f$ , to find a function $F$ that has it as its derivative, with the initial information that $F(a) = 0$ , for some selected point $a$ . That is, it is in effect a constructive way to solve what in differential equations terminology would be called the initial-value problem , or IVP, $$\\frac{dF}{dx} = f, F(a) = 0$$ that proceeds as follows. We are given the only starting information that $F(a) = 0$ , and that $F' = f$ . So suppose we are to construct the value of $F$ at a new point $b$ for which $b > a$ . How may we try this, given what we've already discussed? So now, think about what I just said about the meaning of the derivative, and ask yourself this question: I know that $F'$ here is how sensitive it is to a small change. So suppose I were to now do a Zeno-like manoeuvre and hop a small amount $\\Delta x$ from $a$ rightward along the real number line to $a + \\Delta x$ . What then should we guess for $F(a + \\Delta x)$ ? Well, if you got what I just mentioned, then you should come to that, since $F'(a)$ is proportionately how much $F$ will respond to a small change in its input around $a$ , and what we are doing is exactly that: to make such a small change from $a$ to $a + \\Delta x$ , then we should likewise shift $F(a)$ to $F(a) + (F'(a) \\Delta x)$ , so that $$\\begin{align}\nF(a + \\Delta x) &\\approx F(a) + [F'(a)\\ \\Delta x]\\\\\n &= F(a) + [f(a)\\ \\Delta x]\\end{align}$$ . And then, we can do the same thing, and make another small \"wiggle\" from $a + \\Delta x$ to $[a + \\Delta x] + \\Delta x$ (i.e. $a + 2\\Delta x$ ), and we get $$\\begin{align}F([a + \\Delta x] + \\Delta x) &\\approx F(a + \\Delta x) + [F'(a + \\Delta x)\\ \\Delta x]\\\\\n&= F(a) + [f(a) + \\Delta x] + [f(a + \\Delta x)\\ \\Delta x]\\end{align}$$ and if you continue on this way all the way until we get to $b$ , or at least as close as possible, you see we have $$F(b) \\approx \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(a + n\\Delta x)\\ \\Delta x$$ or, letting $x_i := a + i\\Delta x$ , $$F(b) \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(x_i)\\ \\Delta x$$ . Moreover, we can generalize this a bit further still to allow for irregular steps, which increases the flexibility a bit for, say, mildly discontinuous input functions $f$ , and so we get $$F(b) \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(x_i)\\ \\Delta x_i$$ and we're almost there, all it takes now is a limit to get to... $$F(b) = \\lim_{||\\Delta|| \\rightarrow 0} \\sum_i f(x_i)\\ \\Delta x_i$$ and if we introduce a bit of notation for this new concept now... $$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\ dx := \\lim_{||\\Delta|| \\rightarrow 0} \\sum_i f(x_i)\\ \\Delta x_i$$ which is...? And by the way, is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus much of a \"surprise\" now, or almost tautological, something that was by design, not a mystery to be solved? (This is pattern I also find crops up elsewhere where the best motivating reason for something is put after and not before - e.g. Cayley's theorem in abstract algebra.) That is, the real surprise is not that we can use the Riemann sum to find an antiderivative - that's its whole point - but that this sum also can describe an area and that is, indeed, much less trivial to prove.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem again.\n\nThe user is asking about the Riemann Sum and why it converges to the actual area under the curve, especially concerned about accumulating errors similar to the Pi = 4 paradox with the staircase approximating a circle. They want a proof that the errors don't accumulate in the case of Riemann Sums.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The example given had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem is more conceptual. Let me think about the implicit assumptions here.\n\nAssumptions in the problem might relate to the function being integrated. For instance, the function is probably continuous on the interval [a, b], which is necessary for Riemann integrability. Also, the limit as the number of rectangles approaches infinity with the width going to zero. The user mentions \"increasingly many, increasingly small errors,\" so maybe the function is Riemann integrable, which requires the function to be bounded and continuous almost everywhere. But the original question doesn't specify these conditions, so maybe the assumptions need to be extracted from the context.\n\nWait, the original question is from a high school student learning calculus, so they might be dealing with continuous functions. But the user is concerned about the general case. However, the problem statement as given doesn't explicitly state the function's properties. Should I include assumptions about the function being integrable, like continuity?\n\nIn the example provided, the assumption was about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about the convergence of Riemann sums. The key assumptions here would relate to the function being Riemann integrable. However, the user might not mention that explicitly. But since the problem is about why the limit converges to the area, the assumption is that the function is Riemann integrable. However, since the user is in high school, maybe they are dealing with continuous functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions, but in the context of calculus, the standard assumptions are that the function is continuous on [a, b], which implies it's Riemann integrable. So, the assumption here could be that the function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. That's a common condition for Riemann sums to converge.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- The limit is taken as the number of rectangles approaches infinity (or equivalently, the width of each rectangle approaches zero).\n- The Riemann sum is defined using the chosen sample points (left endpoints, right endpoints, midpoints, etc.).\n\nWait, but the user mentions the \"Riemann Sum gives us the area under the curve.\" The key here is that under certain conditions, the Riemann sum converges to the integral. So the main assumptions are that the function is Riemann integrable (which for a high school level, likely continuous on [a, b]). Also, that the mesh of the partition goes to zero. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The function f is continuous on [a, b].\n- The limit is taken as the maximum width of the subintervals approaches zero.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be more precise, Riemann integrable functions are those where the upper and lower sums converge to the same limit. So continuity is a sufficient condition but not necessary.\n\nBut the user is likely working with continuous functions, so maybe that's the key assumption here.\n\nIn the example given, the user's original problem mentioned that n is an integer, so similarly here, the assumptions would relate to the function and the interval.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- The Riemann sum is constructed using partitions with maximum subinterval width approaching zero.\n\nBut perhaps the problem as posed by the student doesn't state these assumptions explicitly. However, to structure the problem, we need to extract the implicit assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as stated doesn't have specific assumptions beyond the general Riemann integration, so perhaps the assumption is just that the function is Riemann integrable.\n\nBut in the example, the user included the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so maybe in that case, the user made a mistake. Wait, the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like a mistake. So perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, maybe in this current problem, the user wants to filter out unrelated information and list the correct assumptions. But since the original example might have an error, maybe the assistant should take care here.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking about why the Riemann sum converges to the area, specifically concerned about error accumulation. The key assumptions here would be the conditions under which Riemann sums converge to the integral, which would be that the function is Riemann integrable (so bounded and continuous almost everywhere), and that the mesh of the partition goes to zero.\n\nBut given that the user is in high school calculus, the function is likely continuous. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- The limit of the Riemann sum is taken as the maximum width of the subintervals approaches zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the Riemann sums equals the definite integral of f over [a, b], i.e., the area under the curve.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is as the user stated: \"How do we know the Riemann Sum gives us the area under the curve?\" So, the problem is to prove that the limit of Riemann sums equals the area under the curve.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- The Riemann sum is computed using partitions where the maximum subinterval width approaches zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the Riemann sums of f over [a, b] equals the area under the curve of f, i.e., the definite integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx.\n\nBut maybe the user didn't mention continuity, so should we include that as an assumption? In the original question, the user doesn't specify any conditions on the function, but in the context, they are learning calculus, so likely working with continuous functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is asking about the general case, but the answer would require specifying the conditions under which Riemann sums converge. So the problem as structured would need to list the necessary assumptions. So the key assumptions for the Riemann sum to equal the integral are:\n\n1. f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] (which in calculus usually means f is continuous on [a, b]).\n2. The limit is taken as the mesh (maximum subinterval width) of the partition approaches zero.\n3. The sample points in each subinterval are chosen arbitrarily (but the sum converges regardless as the mesh approaches zero if f is integrable).\n\nBut since the user is comparing to the Pi=4 paradox where the staircase approximates the circle but the length doesn't converge, the difference here is that for Riemann sums, the function's continuity ensures that the error in each subinterval becomes negligible as the partition becomes finer. So continuity is key.\n\nHence, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function f is continuous on [a, b].\n- The limit is taken as the maximum width of the subintervals in the partition approaches zero.\n\nSo the problem is to prove that under these assumptions, the Riemann sum converges to the definite integral.\n\nTherefore, formatting as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The function f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b].\n- The limit is taken as the maximum width of the subintervals in the partition approaches zero.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of the Riemann sums of f over [a, b] equals the definite integral ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx, i.e., the area under the curve.\n\nI think this captures the necessary assumptions and the problem. The original question is about why the errors don't accumulate like in the staircase paradox, so the answer would involve the continuity of f and the convergence of Riemann sums for continuous functions.",
