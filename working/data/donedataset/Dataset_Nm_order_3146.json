    "Content": "I have heard the claim: \"Any closed manifold admits a Morse function which has one local minimum and one local maximum\" often used in talks without a reference. This does not seem to be very easy to prove \"hands on\". Trying to perturb the minima/maxima away locally will create new local minima/maxima, so I don't believe this will work. One idea I had is to embed the manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, using Whitney, taking the height function, and turning on some flow in one fixed direction (I see this as stretching a balloon). I could not get the details right at all though... Thus my question is: Is there an elementary proof of this fact? What are the standard references?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a direct proof.  Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold and $f$ a Morse function on $M$.  Let $p_i$ be the local minima, $q_j$ be the index-$1$ critical points, $f(p_i)<f(q_j)$ for all $i,j$, and $\\gamma_{ij}$ the gradient flow line from $p_i$ to $q_j$.  Connect each $p_i$ to $p_0$ by a direct path of $\\gamma_{ij}$s.  Note in particular the graph we have defined is contractible.  Homotope $f$ so the $q_j$ which are not on any paths have a greater value than the $q_j$ which are on the path, say (by scaling and translating) $f^{-1}(1)$ separates the greater $q_j$ and the $q_j$ on the path.  Now consider $B = f^{-1}(\\infty,1]$.  By construction, this is diffeomorphic to an $n$-ball.  In $B$, replace $f$ by the radial distance function (possibly homotoped to match smoothly with $f$ on $\\partial B$).  This new $f$, call it $\\widetilde{f}$, has exactly one index $0$ critical point. Repeat the procedure for $-\\widetilde{f}$ to get exactly one index $n$ critical point. Intuitively, think of a level surface flow.  It starts with a bunch of dots, the index $0$ critical points, expanding.  Then they send out tendrils which join together at the index $1$ critical points.  Controlling the Morse function is tantamount to controlling the level surface flow.  We slow down the level surfaces near some of the index $1$ points so that the level surfaces all join into a giant sphere.  This is our motivation; inside the sphere, we modify the function so that the sphere has expanded from a single dot, instead of many dots. Here's another proof using handlebody decompositions. By duality between Morse theory and handlebody theory, \"Every manifold admits a Morse function with exactly one local maximum and exactly one local minimum\" is equivalent to saying that every closed manifold admits a handlebody decomposition with exactly one $0$-handle and exactly one $n$-handle.  To see this, take a smooth handlebody decomposition of $M$ (\"smooth\" so that the attaching maps are all smooth maps).  Since this is done by gluing successive handles, we may focus our attention on the $0$-handles $M^0$ and the manifold obtained by gluing $1$-handles, $M^1$. Since $M$ is connected and the only handle with disconnected attaching spheres are $1$-handles, $M^1$ is connected (that is, the gluing of $1$-handles kills all elements of $\\pi_0$).  Therefore, we may pick a single $0$-handle and connect it to each other $0$-handle by a path of $1$-handles (possibly through other $0$-handles).  This union of $0$- and $1$-handles is homeomorphic to a ball, so we may replace it with a single $0$-handle and regard the remaining $1$-handles as attaching to the single $0$-handle. Turn the handlebody decomposition upside down and repeat to obtain a single $n$-handle. References to look into: Milnor's Morse Theory , Milnor's \"Killing paper\", Ranicki's book on surgery.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure with Assumptions and Problem. The example provided shows that the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh, maybe in the example, the user restructured the problem to include an assumption that wasn't originally there? Or perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption. Hmm.\n\nBut in the current problem, the question is about proving that any closed manifold admits a Morse function with one minimum and one maximum. The original problem mentions \"Any closed manifold\", so the assumptions would probably be related to that. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe question states: \"Any closed manifold admits a Morse function which has one local minimum and one local maximum.\" So the key assumptions here are that the manifold is closed. The problem is to prove the existence of such a Morse function.\n\nWait, the example given by the user included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, the user had written \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added the divisibility by 7. That seems like the example might have an error. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a typo? Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem example says: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would include all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So maybe that example is incorrect? Or perhaps there's a misalignment between the original and formatted problem in the example. Hmm. That might be a mistake. But the user provided that as an example, so I should follow the structure regardless.\n\nSo for the current problem, the user wants me to extract the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem here is about closed manifolds. So the assumption here is that the manifold is closed. Then the problem is to prove that there exists a Morse function on it with one local minimum and one local maximum.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement says \"Any manifold admits a morse function with one minimum and one maximum\". But in the question details, it's clarified as \"Any closed manifold\". So the key assumption is that the manifold is closed. So in the formatted problem, the assumption would be \"The manifold is closed.\" Then the problem is to prove that it admits a Morse function with one local minimum and one local maximum.\n\nI don't see other assumptions here. The problem doesn't mention orientability, dimension, or any other properties. So the main assumption is the manifold being closed. So I need to structure it accordingly.",
