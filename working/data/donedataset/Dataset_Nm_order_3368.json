    "Content": "Prove that $$a^4+b^4+1\\ge a+b$$ for all real numbers $a,b$ . What I've tried: 1.I checked how AM-GM may help but doesn't look like it's useful here. I've tried: $$(a^2+b^2)^2 -2(ab)^2+1 \\ge a+b$$ But unfortunately, I can't find any way to continue this..\nI'm sure that this isn't too hard, it's just that \"I'm not seeing it\", I would appreciate if clues are given first so I can answer this myself. *This exercise is from the TAU entry exams.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proof Since $$\\left(a^4-a^2+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+\\left(b^4-b^2+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)=\\left(a^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(b^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\geq0,$$ hence $$a^4+b^4+1 \\geq a^2+b^2+\\frac{1}{2}.\\tag1$$ Since $$\\left(a^2-a+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+\\left(b^2-b+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)=\\left(a-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\geq 0,$$ hence, $$a^2+b^2+\\frac{1}{2} \\geq a+b.\\tag2$$ Combining $(1)$ and $(2)$ , $$a^4+b^4+1 \\geq a+b.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format the problem from Math Stack Exchange according to the given example. The original problem is to prove that a^4 + b^4 + 1 is greater than or equal to a + b for all real numbers a and b. The user mentioned they tried AM-GM and some expansion but couldn't proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states \"for all real numbers a, b\". So the main assumptions here are about the variables a and b being real. Since there are no additional conditions like positivity or specific values, the assumptions should just be that a and b are real numbers. The problem itself is to prove the inequality a^4 + b^4 + 1 ≥ a + b.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In this case, the two variables a and b are both real, so each should be on a separate line. The example for the previous problem had two assumptions (n is an integer and n divisible by 7), but here there are two separate variables each being real. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- a is a real number,\n- b is a real number.\n\nThen the problem is to prove the inequality. So putting it all together, the formatted problem should have these two assumptions and the problem statement. I need to make sure not to include any extra information from the user's attempt, like the AM-GM part or their expansion, since the task is to filter unrelated information. The title and the user's thoughts are part of the original question, but the formatted problem should only include the essential assumptions and the problem statement.",
