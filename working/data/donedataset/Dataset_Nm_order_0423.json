    "Content": "I know that $p$-norm of $x\\in\\Bbb{R}^n$ is defined as, for all $p\\ge1$,$$\\Vert{x}\\Vert_p=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\vert{x_i}\\vert^p\\right)^{1/p}.$$ The textbook refers to \"Every norm is convex\" for an example of convex functions. I failed to prove $f(x)=\\Vert{x}\\Vert_p$ for all $p\\ge1$, then tried to find the proof on the internet but I cannot find it. Can someone let me understand why $p$-norm is convex for all $p\\ge1$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The Definition of a norm is: Be V a Vectorspace, $\\|\\cdot\\|: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $ is a norm $:\\iff $ $\\forall v \\in V: \\|v\\|\\ge0$ and $\\|v\\| =0 \\iff v=0$ (positive/definite) $\\forall v\\in V, \\lambda\\in \\mathbb{R}: |\\lambda|\\|v\\| =\\|\\lambda v\\|$ (absolutely scaleable) $\\forall v,w\\in V : \\|v+w\\| \\le \\|v\\|+\\|w\\|$ (Triangle inequality) The Definition of convex is: $f:V\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is convex $:\\iff$ $\\forall  v,w \\in V, \\lambda \\in [0,1]: f(\\lambda v+(1-\\lambda )w)\\le \\lambda f(v) +(1-\\lambda)f(w)$ So using the Triangle inequality and the fact that the norm is absolutely scalable, you can see that every Norm is convex: $$\\|\\lambda v+(1-\\lambda )w\\|\\le\\|\\lambda v\\|+\\|(1-\\lambda)w\\| = \\lambda\\|v\\|+(1- \\lambda)\\|w\\|$$ So by definition every norm is convex. What is left to show is, that the p-norm is in fact a norm. The first two requirements are pretty easy to show, the third is hard. That is why it has its own name: the Minkowski Inequality which is a result of the Hölder inequality and shows that the triangle inequality holds for every p-norm (if p>1) and thus that it is a norm. EDIT: Since this seems to be somewhat popular, I thought I would add a sketch of the proof of the Minkowski inequality. You show Young's Inequality : $xy\\le \\frac{x^p}{p}+\\frac{y^q}{q}\\quad \\forall q,p>1 \\text{ with } \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1,\\ \\forall x,y\\ge 0$ . You can do that by looking at the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^p}{p}+\\frac{y^q}{q}-xy$ find the critical point, show it is a minimum and is greater zero (derivatives). You show the Hölder Inequality : $\\|fg\\|_1 \\le \\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q \\quad \\forall q,p>1 \\text{ with } \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$ You can do that by setting $x=\\frac{|f|}{||f||_p}$ and $y=\\frac{|g|}{||g||_q}$ and plug them into young's inequality.\nYou get \\begin{align}\n&&\\frac{|fg|}{\\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q}&\\le \\frac{|f|^p}{p\\|f\\|_p^p} + \\frac{|g|^q}{q\\|g\\|_q^q}\n\\\\\n\\Rightarrow &&\\int \\frac{|fg|}{\\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q} d\\mu &\\le \\int \\frac{|f|^p}{p\\|f\\|_p^p}d\\mu + \\int \\frac{|g|^q}{q\\|g\\|_q^q}d\\mu\n\\\\\n\\Rightarrow &&\\frac{\\|fg\\|_1}{\\|f\\|_p\\|g\\|_q}&\\le \\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1\n\\end{align} It works just the same for sequences or $\\mathbb{R}^n$ , you just use young's inequality for every index and then sum over it instead of using the integral. And last the Minkowski Inequality : $\\|x+y\\|_p\\le\\|x\\|_p+\\|y\\|_p \\quad \\forall p>1$ Set $q=\\frac{p}{p-1}$ thus $q(p-1)=p$ and $\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$ . Then: \\begin{align}\n\\|x+y\\|_p^p&=\\int |x+y|^pd\\mu\\le\\int |x+y|^{p-1}|x|d\\mu+ \\int |x+y|^{p-1}|y|d\\mu\n\\\\\n&\\le \\left(\\int|x+y|^{q(p-1)}d\\mu\\right)^{1/q}\\left(\\int|x|^pd\\mu\\right)^{1/p} + \\left(\\int|x+y|^{q(p-1)}d\\mu\\right)^{1/q}\\left(\\int|y|^pd\\mu\\right)^{1/p}\n\\\\\n&=\\left(\\int|x+y|^{p}d\\mu\\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}\\frac{p}{q}}(\\|x\\|_p+\\|y\\|_p)\n=\\|x+y\\|_p^{p/q}(\\|x\\|_p+\\|y\\|_p)\n\\end{align} If you realize that $p-\\frac{p}{q}=p(1-\\frac{1}{q})=1$ you are done.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me first read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe question is about proving that every p-norm is convex. The user mentions that they know the definition of the p-norm for p ≥ 1 and that they tried to prove it themselves but couldn't. They also looked online without success and are asking for an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The example given in the problem had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the original question for such assumptions.\n\nThe p-norm is defined for all p ≥ 1, so that's one assumption: p is a real number greater than or equal to 1. The norm is applied to vectors x in R^n, so another assumption is that x is an element of R^n. However, since the problem is about the convexity of the p-norm, maybe we need to state that the function in question is the p-norm, which is a function from R^n to R. But in the example provided, the assumptions were more about the variables involved. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing a single condition on a single object. Here, the key objects are p and x. The conditions on p are that p ≥ 1. The problem is about the convexity of the p-norm function. So perhaps the assumptions should be:\n\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to show that the p-norm is convex, which is a property of the function. However, in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem's conditions. But in this case, the original problem doesn't have any additional conditions beyond the definition of the p-norm and the fact that p ≥ 1. So the main assumptions here are that p is at least 1 and that we're working in R^n. However, the convexity of a function is a general property, so maybe the assumption is just that p ≥ 1. The vectors x and y would be part of the problem statement in proving convexity, which requires considering two points and the line segment between them.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on the variables. Here, the problem is about the convexity of the p-norm. The definition of a convex function is that for all x, y in the domain and λ ∈ [0,1], f(λx + (1-λ)y) ≤ λf(x) + (1-λ)f(y). So the assumptions for convexity would inherently involve x and y being in R^n and λ being between 0 and 1. But perhaps the user doesn't want those as assumptions because they are part of the general definition of convexity. Instead, the key assumptions here are the ones given in the problem statement: the p-norm is defined for p ≥ 1, and we need to prove its convexity.\n\nSo the main assumptions to list here would be:\n\n- p is a real number such that p ≥ 1.\n- The function f is defined as the p-norm of x in R^n.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they listed the assumptions as \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". In the current problem, the user is asking why every p-norm is convex for all p ≥ 1. Therefore, the key assumptions are that p ≥ 1 and that f(x) = ||x||_p. However, in the example, the assumption about n being divisible by 7 was actually an extra condition, but in the original problem here, the only condition given is p ≥ 1. The problem is to prove that for these p values, the p-norm is convex. So the assumptions should be:\n\n1. p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\n2. f(x) is the p-norm of x, defined as (sum |x_i|^p)^(1/p).\n\nBut I need to check if each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So first assumption: p ≥ 1. Second: f(x) is the p-norm. But maybe breaking down further. However, in the example, they didn't mention the function A(n); the problem was stated as the function. Maybe the assumptions here are just p ≥ 1, and x is in R^n. But the problem is about the convexity of the p-norm. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows:\n\nAssumption: p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\nProblem: Prove that the function f(x) = ||x||_p is convex.\n\nBut the original question also mentions that the user knows that every norm is convex, but they are specifically asking about p-norms. However, the answer might involve showing that the p-norm is indeed a norm (which requires p ≥ 1), and since all norms are convex, the result follows. But perhaps the user is not aware of the general proof that all norms are convex. Alternatively, the problem might be to show the convexity directly for p-norms.\n\nBut according to the original question, the textbook refers to \"Every norm is convex\" as an example, so the user might be confused why p-norms are convex, given that they are norms. Maybe the actual problem is to prove that the p-norm is a norm (which requires convexity), but the user is missing that step. However, the question is phrased as \"why is every p-norm convex\", so the key is to either show it's a norm (hence convex) or show convexity directly.\n\nBut the user might not have made the connection that p-norms are norms, hence convex. So perhaps the problem is to prove that the p-norm is convex, under the assumption that p ≥ 1. Therefore, the assumptions would be p ≥ 1, and the problem is to prove the convexity of the p-norm.\n\nThus, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list the conditions on p and the definition of the function, but according to the example, they list the conditions on the variables involved. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems to be a mistake, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that example might have been incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, the example they provided was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n + 1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems to add an extra assumption not present in the original problem. Wait, maybe that was a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original. Perhaps the user made an error in their example, but I should follow their format regardless.\n\nGiven that, maybe the assumptions in the current problem should be:\n\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that the p-norm is convex. The user is asking why the p-norm is convex for all p ≥ 1. Since convexity is a property of the function, the key assumption is that p ≥ 1, ensuring that the p-norm is indeed a norm (since for p < 1, it's not a norm). Therefore, the main assumption is p ≥ 1.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were on the variable n. Here, the variables involved in the problem are p and x. However, the problem is to prove convexity of the p-norm, which is a function of x. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\n- x is a vector in R^n.\n\nBut since convexity is about the function over all x, maybe x being in R^n is part of the problem's domain, not an assumption. The key assumption is p ≥ 1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that for any p ≥ 1, the function ||x||_p is convex in x.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\nProblem: Prove that the function f(x) = ||x||_p is convex.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might implicitly assume that we're working in R^n, but the example didn't mention the space for n. In the example, the assumption was about n being an integer. Here, maybe the key is to list the conditions on p and perhaps x being in R^n. However, according to the example, the assumptions were about the parameters (n) and their conditions. Here, p is a parameter, so the assumption is p ≥ 1. The vector x is part of the function's domain, which might not need to be listed as an assumption but is part of the problem's context.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: p is a real number with p ≥ 1.\nProblem: Prove that the p-norm ||x||_p is convex.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure, where the assumption was on the parameter (n being an integer and divisible by 7), and the problem was about A(n). Here, the parameter is p ≥ 1, and the problem is about the convexity of the p-norm.",
