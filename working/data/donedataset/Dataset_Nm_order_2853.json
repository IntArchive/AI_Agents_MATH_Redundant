    "AcceptedAnswer": "$$I=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ln^2(x)\\sin(x^2)dx \\overset{x^2=t}=\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt t} \\ln^2 (\\sqrt t) \\sin t dt =\\frac18 \\int_0^\\infty t^{-1/2}\\sin t \\ln^2 t \\,dt$$ Note that the last integral is the Mellin transform in $s=\\frac12 $ of the sine after being differentiated twice. See for example here a proof for: $$\\int_0^\\infty  x^{s-1}\\sin x dx= \\Gamma(s) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$$ $$\\Rightarrow I=\\frac18\\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\\Gamma(s) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)\\bigg|_{s=\\frac12}$$ It's not the end of the world to differentiate that twice since the digamma function comes in our help. From the wiki page we have: $\\Gamma'(x)=\\Gamma(x)\\psi(x)$ $$\\Rightarrow \\frac{d}{ds}\\Gamma(s) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)=\\Gamma(s)\\psi(s)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right) +\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\Gamma(s)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)$$ $$\\Rightarrow \\frac{d^2}{ds^2}\\Gamma(s) \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)=\\frac{d}{ds}\\Gamma(s)\\left(\\psi(s)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)\\right)$$ $$=\\Gamma(x)\\psi(x)\\left(\\psi(s)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)\\right)+\\Gamma(s)\\left(\\psi_1(x)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\Gamma(s)\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)-\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi s}{2}\\right)\\right)$$ And now setting $s=\\frac12$ we get using $\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)=\\sqrt{\\pi}$ , $\\psi\\left(\\frac12 \\right)=-\\gamma -2\\ln 2 $ , $\\  \\psi_1\\left(\\frac12\\right)=\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}$ the result.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let me try to parse through this problem. The user is asking about proving the integral of ln²(x) times sin(x²) from 0 to infinity equals a specific expression involving gamma, pi, and log 16. They mentioned some steps they took using Frullani's integral and transforming the integral into a triple integral. Now, I need to structure this problem according to the given format.\n\nFirst, the Assumptions section should list each condition or property applied to one object. Let me see. The original integral involves ln squared x and sin(x²). The user transformed the integral using Frullani's formula, replacing ln(x) with an integral involving exponentials. They also converted the sin(x²) integral into one involving sin(x)/sqrt(x). The problem as stated is to prove the given result. The user didn't mention any specific constraints like limits on variables or convergence, but maybe the assumptions include the convergence of the integrals involved, the applicability of Frullani's integral here, and the interchange of integrals.\n\nWait, in the example provided, assumptions were about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, the problem is about an integral, so perhaps assumptions are about the functions involved. Let me list each assumption:\n\n1. The integral ∫₀^∞ ln²(x) sin(x²) dx converges.\n2. Frullani's Integral formula can be applied to ln(x) in this context.\n3. The interchange of integrals (Fubini's theorem) is valid for the triple integral.\n4. The integral ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx is expressible as (1/2) ∫₀^∞ x^(-1/2) sin(x) dx.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So each line addresses one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that the integral equals the given expression. So the formatted problem would list those assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nLet me check the original question again. The user starts by stating the integral result and mentions their attempts using Frullani's Integral and changing variables. They also reference a general case, but the main problem is (1). The assumptions would include the conditions needed for their approach to work, like applying Frullani, switching integrals, convergence, and the integral transformation for sin(x²).\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ ln²(x) sin(x²) dx converges,\nFrullani's Integral formula is applicable to ln(x) in this context,\nThe interchange of order of integration in the triple integral is valid,\nThe integral ∫₀^∞ sin(x²) dx can be transformed into (1/2) ∫₀^∞ x^(-1/2) sin(x) dx.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n∫₀^∞ ln²(x) sin(x²) dx = (1/32)√(π/2) (2γ - π + ln 16)².\n\nThat seems to capture the necessary assumptions and the problem statement. Each assumption is a separate line addressing a specific condition. The problem is as stated.",
