    "AcceptedAnswer": "First, note that since $X \\cap Z \\subseteq X$ and $X \\cap Z \\subseteq Z$, we have that for $y \\in X \\cap Z$, $T_y(X \\cap Z) \\subseteq T_y(X)$ and $T_y(X \\cap Z) \\subseteq T_y(Z)$, or\n$$T_y(X \\cap Z) \\subseteq T_y(X) \\cap T_y(Z),$$\nby the definition of intersection. Since $X \\pitchfork Z$, we have that\n$$\\mathrm{codim}(X \\cap Z) = \\mathrm{codim}(X) + \\mathrm{codim}(Z),$$\nor\n$$\\dim(X \\cap Z) = \\dim(X) + \\dim(Z) - n,$$\nwhich tells us that\n$$\\dim(T_y(X \\cap Z)) = \\dim(T_y(X)) + \\dim(T_y(Z)) - n.$$\nOn the other hand, from linear algebra we know the formula for the dimension of an intersection of vector spaces:\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\dim(T_y(X) \\cap T_y(Z)) & = \\dim(T_y(X)) + \\dim(T_y(Z)) - \\dim(T_y(X) + T_y(Z)) \\\\\n\t & = \\dim(T_y(X)) + \\dim(T_y(Z)) - n,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\dim(T_y(X) + T_y(Z)) = n$ since $X \\pitchfork Z$. Then since $T_y(X \\cap Z) \\subseteq T_y(X) \\cap T_y(Z)$ and both vector spaces have the same dimension, it must be that they are equal. We conclude that for all $y \\in X \\cap Z$,\n$$T_y(X \\cap Z) = T_y(X) \\cap T_y(Z).$$ Note that we can't automatically conclude the second part. Here transversality is important. For example if\n$$X = \\{(x, 0) : x \\in \\Bbb R\\} \\subset \\Bbb R^2, \\quad Z = \\{(x,x^2) : x \\in \\Bbb R\\} \\subset \\Bbb R^2,$$\nwe have that $X \\cap Z = \\{(0,0)\\}$, so that $T_{(0,0)}(X \\cap Z) = \\{0\\}$, a zero-dimensional vector space. But $T_{(0,0)} (X) = T_{(0,0)} (Z)$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space, so that we necessarily have a strict inclusion\n$$T_{(0,0)}(X \\cap Z) \\subset T_{(0,0)}(X) \\cap T_{(0,0)} (Z).$$\nThe problem here is that $X$ and $Z$ do not intersect transversally.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the tangent space to the intersection of two transversal submanifolds X and Z at a point y is equal to the intersection of their individual tangent spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. Two submanifolds X and Z of Y are transversal if, for every point y in their intersection, the tangent space of Y at y is the sum of the tangent spaces of X and Z at y. That is, T_y(Y) = T_y(X) + T_y(Z). This transversality condition is crucial because it ensures that the intersection X ∩ Z is also a submanifold of Y, which might not be the case if they aren't transversal.\n\nSo the problem is to show that T_y(X ∩ Z) = T_y(X) ∩ T_y(Z). The user suggests proving both inclusions: first that every tangent vector to the intersection is in both tangent spaces, and conversely that any vector in the intersection of the tangent spaces is a tangent vector to the intersection.\n\nStarting with the first inclusion: Take a vector v in T_y(X ∩ Z). Since X ∩ Z is a submanifold of both X and Z, the tangent space at y should be a subspace of both T_y(X) and T_y(Z). Therefore, v must be in T_y(X) and also in T_y(Z), hence in their intersection. That seems straightforward, using the fact that the inclusion map of X ∩ Z into X and into Z induces linear maps on the tangent spaces, whose images are subspaces of T_y(X) and T_y(Z) respectively. So that direction might not be too hard.\n\nThe other direction is trickier. Suppose v is in both T_y(X) and T_y(Z). We need to show v is in T_y(X ∩ Z). Since X and Z are transversal, their tangent spaces span T_y(Y). But how does that help? Maybe we can use the inverse function theorem or some local coordinates. Since X and Z are transversal, around the point y, we can find coordinates for Y such that X is given by some equations and Z is given by others, and their intersection is given by the combination. Then, the tangent vectors common to both X and Z would be those that satisfy the equations for both, hence lie in the tangent space of the intersection. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more abstract approach using the properties of submanifolds and tangent spaces.\n\nWait, another thought: If X and Z are transversal, then the intersection X ∩ Z is a submanifold whose tangent space is exactly the intersection of the tangent spaces. Maybe this is a standard result in differential geometry. The user is trying to work through the proof, so maybe they need to construct curves in X ∩ Z whose derivatives give the vector v, assuming v is in both tangent spaces. Since v is in T_y(X), there's a curve in X through y with derivative v, and similarly a curve in Z through y with the same derivative. But if the curves are actually in both X and Z, then they lie in the intersection. However, just having two curves in X and Z with the same derivative doesn't immediately imply that there's a single curve in the intersection with that derivative. Hmm, maybe this requires more careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that in local coordinates, X can be represented as a subset where some functions vanish, and similarly for Z. The intersection would be where all those functions vanish. The tangent space at y would then be the kernel of the differentials of all those functions. Since the submanifolds are transversal, the differentials of the functions defining X and Z are linearly independent, so the intersection's tangent space is the intersection of the kernels, which is the same as the intersection of the tangent spaces. \n\nBut I need to make sure that this approach is valid. Let me think: Suppose Y is an m-dimensional manifold, X is a k-dimensional submanifold, Z is an l-dimensional submanifold, and they intersect transversally at y. Then, the codimension of X ∩ Z should be the sum of the codimensions of X and Z. That makes sense because transversality implies that the defining equations for X and Z are independent. So, locally around y, we can choose coordinates such that X is given by the vanishing of m - k coordinates, and Z is given by the vanishing of m - l coordinates, with the two sets of coordinates being independent due to transversality. Then, X ∩ Z is given by the vanishing of both sets of coordinates, hence a submanifold of dimension k + l - m. The tangent space at y would then be the vectors whose components corresponding to the vanishing coordinates are zero. Since T_y(X) is the set of vectors where the coordinates vanishing on X are zero, and similarly for T_y(Z), their intersection is the vectors where both sets of coordinates are zero, which is exactly T_y(X ∩ Z). So this local coordinate argument seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is to use the transversality condition to set up local coordinates where the submanifolds X and Z are defined by independent equations, making their intersection's tangent space the intersection of their individual tangent spaces. The user might need to formalize this argument, possibly invoking the implicit function theorem or the local slice condition for submanifolds.\n\nAnother point to check: The problem states that X and Z are transversal submanifolds, so the intersection is indeed a submanifold, and the tangent space equality holds. The user's initial idea is correct in wanting to show both inclusions. The first inclusion (T_y(X ∩ Z) ⊂ T_y(X) ∩ T_y(Z)) is straightforward as any tangent vector to the intersection must be tangent to both X and Z. The reverse inclusion requires using the transversality to ensure that the dimensions match up and that the intersection of the tangent spaces has the correct dimension to be the tangent space of X ∩ Z.\n\nIn terms of dimensions, if X is of dimension k, Z is of dimension l, and Y is of dimension m, then transversality implies that k + l - m = dim(X ∩ Z). Similarly, the tangent spaces T_y(X) and T_y(Z) are subspaces of T_y(Y) of dimensions k and l, respectively, and their intersection would have dimension dim(T_y(X) ∩ T_y(Z)) = k + l - m (since their sum is T_y(Y) which has dimension m). Therefore, the dimension of the intersection of the tangent spaces is equal to the dimension of T_y(X ∩ Z), so once we have one inclusion, the other follows by dimension counting. But maybe the problem expects a direct proof without relying on dimension arguments.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that if you have a vector in both tangent spaces, then there exist curves in X and Z with that vector as their derivative. But because of transversality, these curves can be \"combined\" in some way to give a curve in the intersection. However, I'm not sure how to make that precise. Perhaps using the local coordinate chart, if in coordinates, the curves lie in both X and Z, then they lie in the intersection. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nSuppose v is in T_y(X) ∩ T_y(Z). Then there exists a smooth curve γ: (-ε, ε) → X such that γ(0) = y and γ'(0) = v. Similarly, there's a smooth curve δ: (-ε, ε) → Z with δ(0) = y and δ'(0) = v. But how does this help? The problem is that γ is in X and δ is in Z, but we need a single curve that's in both X and Z, hence in X ∩ Z. But since both curves have the same derivative at y, maybe we can use some kind of uniqueness? Wait, in a coordinate chart around y, if we represent both curves in the coordinates where X and Z are coordinate subspaces, then the curves would have components only along the directions of X and Z respectively. But if v is in both tangent spaces, then in these coordinates, v would have components only in the directions common to both X and Z, which are precisely the directions of X ∩ Z. Therefore, the curve in these coordinates would stay within X ∩ Z, hence the derivative v is in T_y(X ∩ Z). That might work.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the argument would go like this:\n\n1. Since X and Z are transversal at y, we can choose a coordinate chart around y in Y such that X corresponds to some coordinates being zero, and Z corresponds to another set of coordinates being zero, with the two sets independent.\n\n2. In these coordinates, T_y(X) is the set of vectors with zero in the coordinates corresponding to X's defining equations, and similarly for T_y(Z).\n\n3. A vector v in T_y(X) ∩ T_y(Z) would have zeros in both sets of coordinates, hence lies in T_y(X ∩ Z), which is the intersection defined by both sets of zeros.\n\n4. Conversely, any vector in T_y(X ∩ Z) must have zeros in both sets, hence lies in the intersection of the tangent spaces.\n\nTherefore, the equality holds.\n\nThe user's original approach was to do the inclusions directly, which is valid. The first inclusion is straightforward. For the reverse inclusion, using the coordinate chart as above gives a concrete way to see that vectors in the intersection of the tangent spaces must lie in the tangent space of the intersection. Alternatively, invoking the dimension count after establishing one inclusion would suffice, but the coordinate argument is more constructive.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n- Use the transversality to set up local coordinates where X and Z are coordinate submanifolds.\n\n- Express the tangent spaces in these coordinates.\n\n- Show that the intersection of T_y(X) and T_y(Z) in coordinates corresponds to T_y(X ∩ Z).\n\nTherefore, the problem can be solved by these methods, and the answer to the user's question is that both inclusions can be shown using such coordinate arguments or dimension counts, relying heavily on the transversality condition.",
