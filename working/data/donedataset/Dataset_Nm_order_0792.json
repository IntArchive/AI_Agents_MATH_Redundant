    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this integral problem. The user wants to show that the integral of [log(tan(x/4))]^2 from 0 to pi equals pi³/4. They tried expanding the logarithm using log(sin/cos) and then split it into three integrals. Now they're stuck on evaluating those integrals. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some integral techniques involving logarithmic functions and trigonometric integrals. The substitution seems crucial here. The limits are from 0 to pi, and the argument inside the log is tan(x/4). Maybe a substitution to simplify the angle? Let's see, if I let t = x/4, then x = 4t, dx = 4dt. Then the limits when x=0, t=0; x=pi, t=pi/4. So the integral becomes 4 times the integral from 0 to pi/4 of [log(tan t)]² dt. Wait, maybe that's a better form? Because tan t from 0 to pi/4 is between 0 and 1, so the logarithm would be negative, but squared makes it positive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use symmetry properties. The original integral is from 0 to pi. The substitution x = pi - y might help, but I'm not sure yet. Also, the integrand involves log squared terms. Perhaps expanding the square was a good start, but the user is stuck on the resulting integrals.\n\nLooking at the three integrals they obtained:\n\n1. Integral of log²(sin x/4) dx from 0 to pi\n2. Integral of log²(cos x/4) dx from 0 to pi\n3. Integral of log(sin x/4) log(cos x/4) dx from 0 to pi\n\nEach of these can be transformed by substitution. Let's take the first one: let u = x/4, then du = dx/4, so dx = 4du. The limits become u from 0 to pi/4. So integral 1 becomes 4 ∫₀^{pi/4} log²(sin u) du. Similarly for integral 2, same substitution: 4 ∫₀^{pi/4} log²(cos u) du. The third integral becomes -2 * 4 ∫₀^{pi/4} log(sin u) log(cos u) du = -8 ∫₀^{pi/4} log(sin u) log(cos u) du.\n\nSo the total integral I is 4 times [Integral1 + Integral2 - 2 Integral3]. Wait, no, the original split was:\n\nI = ∫ log² sin + ∫ log² cos - 2 ∫ log sin log cos\n\nBut after substitution, each integral is over 0 to pi/4, scaled by 4. So the entire expression becomes 4*( [∫₀^{pi/4} log² sin u du + ∫₀^{pi/4} log² cos u du - 2 ∫₀^{pi/4} log sin u log cos u du ] )\n\nHmm. Maybe combining these integrals. Let's think about the properties of sin and cos over the interval 0 to pi/4. For example, cos(pi/4 - u) = sin u, so perhaps a substitution could relate the integrals of sin and cos. Let me try substituting u = pi/4 - t in the integral involving cos. Then when u=0, t=pi/4; u=pi/4, t=0. So ∫₀^{pi/4} log² cos u du = ∫₀^{pi/4} log² sin(pi/4 - u) du. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, over the interval 0 to pi/2, there are known integrals involving log squared sin, but here it's 0 to pi/4.\n\nAlternatively, consider extending the interval. Maybe use substitution to make it from 0 to pi/2. Let me see. For instance, if we let t = 2u, then when u goes from 0 to pi/4, t goes from 0 to pi/2. But that may complicate things. Alternatively, recall that ∫₀^{pi/2} log² sin t dt is a known integral. Maybe there's a formula for that.\n\nI recall that integrals of log squared sin x over 0 to pi/2 can be evaluated using Fourier series or using Euler's formula. The result is (pi/2)( (pi²)/12 + (log² 2)/2 ). Wait, not sure about exact value. Alternatively, using the expansion of log sin x in Fourier series and then integrating term by term. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the integral of [log(tan u)]² from 0 to pi/4. Wait, tan u from 0 to pi/4 is from 0 to 1, so log(tan u) is negative, but squared is positive. If we let t = tan u, then u goes from 0 to pi/4, t from 0 to 1. Then du = dt/(1 + t²), and the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) dt. Hmm, that might be a known integral. But integrating [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) from 0 to 1. Hmm. Alternatively, consider substitution t = 1/x, but not sure.\n\nWait, but the original integral after substitution is 4 times ∫₀^{pi/4} [log(tan u)]² du. So maybe if we can compute ∫₀^{pi/4} [log(tan u)]² du, multiply by 4 to get I. Let's focus on that integral.\n\nAlternatively, use the substitution v = pi/2 - u. Wait, for u in 0 to pi/4, v would be from pi/2 to 3pi/4. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, expand [log(tan u)]². Since tan u = sin u / cos u, so log(tan u) = log sin u - log cos u. Then [log(tan u)]² = log² sin u + log² cos u - 2 log sin u log cos u. Which is exactly the same as the expression inside the integral. So ∫₀^{pi/4} [log tan u]^2 du = ∫₀^{pi/4} (log² sin u + log² cos u - 2 log sin u log cos u) du. Which is exactly the expression inside the brackets multiplied by 4. Therefore, I = 4 * ∫₀^{pi/4} [log tan u]^2 du. Wait, but this seems circular because the original integral after substitution is exactly 4 times that. So maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, consider differentiating under the integral sign. Or consider series expansion of the logarithm squared. Wait, but log squared is tricky. Alternatively, use Fourier series expansion for log(tan u). Wait, tan u = sin u / cos u, but expanding log(tan u) as a Fourier series might be complex. Alternatively, use substitution related to beta or gamma functions. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. The integral of [log(tan u)]² du from 0 to pi/4. Let’s make substitution t = 2u. Then u = t/2, du = dt/2. When u=0, t=0; u=pi/4, t=pi/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{pi/2} [log(tan(t/2))]² * (dt/2). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Wait, tan(t/2) is related to sine and cosine via the identity tan(t/2) = (1 - cos t)/sin t. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, recall that integrals involving log(tan u) can sometimes be related to the Dirichlet eta function or other special functions. But perhaps there's a smarter substitution.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the integral from 0 to pi/4 of [log(tan u)]² du can be split into two parts: from 0 to pi/4, tan u is less than 1, so log(tan u) is negative. Let’s substitute t = tan u, then u = arctan t, du = dt/(1 + t²). The integral becomes ∫₀¹ [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) dt. Hmm, integrating [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) from 0 to 1. That might be a known integral. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding 1/(1 + t²) as a power series. Since 1/(1 + t²) = Σ (-1)^n t^{2n} for |t| < 1. Then the integral becomes Σ (-1)^n ∫₀¹ t^{2n} [log t]^2 dt. The integral ∫₀¹ t^{2n} [log t]^2 dt can be computed via substitution. Let’s set x = -log t, so t = e^{-x}, dt = -e^{-x} dx. When t=0, x=infty; t=1, x=0. The integral becomes ∫₀^infty e^{-(2n+1)x} x^2 e^{-x} dx = ∫₀^infty x^2 e^{-(2n+2)x} dx. Wait, no: t^{2n} = e^{-2n x}, and [log t]^2 = x². So the integral becomes ∫₀^infty x² e^{-(2n +1)x} dx. Which is equal to 2 / (2n +1)^3. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ t^{2n} [log t]^2 dt = 2 / (2n +1)^3.\n\nTherefore, the original integral becomes Σ_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n * 2 / (2n +1)^3. So that's 2 Σ (-1)^n / (2n +1)^3. This series is known. The sum Σ_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n / (2n +1)^3 is equal to π^3 /32. Wait, I need to verify that. Alternatively, recall that the Dirichlet beta function β(s) = Σ_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / (2n +1)^s. So here s=3. The value of β(3) is known to be π³/32. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) dt = 2 * π³/32 = π³/16. \n\nTherefore, the integral ∫₀^{pi/4} [log(tan u)]² du = ∫₀¹ [log t]^2 / (1 + t²) dt = π³/16. Therefore, the original integral I = 4 * π³/16 = π³/4. Which matches the desired result. \n\nSo the key steps were substituting t = tan u, expanding into a series, recognizing the Dirichlet beta function, and using its known value at s=3. Alternatively, there might be another way using substitution and symmetry, but the series approach works here.",
