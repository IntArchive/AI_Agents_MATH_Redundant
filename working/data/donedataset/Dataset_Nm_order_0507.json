    "Content": "My mathematical background is perhaps a little lacking on this topic, but I've been searching and haven't come up with a satisfactory answer to this question. I have no idea how to approach the problem or if it has been answered. I have seen numerous cases where it is asserted that \"the axiom of choice is necessary\" to complete a particular proof but I've yet to see a case where the necessity of the axiom of choice is actually itself proven. For example consider the following question: Additive function $𝑇:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that is not linear. The answers and comments note that you can't construct such a function without the axiom of choice. Then it seems like this would imply, for example, that any function with a closed form\nwhich is additive is necessarily linear. Is this correct? How would one go about proving the necessity of the axiom of choice? I apologize in advance that I don't have my own attempt to share since I'm not even sure how to approach such a proof.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let's take the axioms of a group. We have a binary operator, $*$ , and the axioms state that there is a neutral element, $e$ , and that $*$ is associative, and for every $x$ there is $y$ such that $x*y=e$ . Question. Is it true that for every $x,y$ it holds that $x*y=y*x$ ? Well, there are infinitely many proofs from these finitely many axioms. So how can we tell? Checking them one by one is futile. The answer is that if this was provable, then every model of the axioms would also satisfy the above property. In other words, every group would be commutative. So if we can find a group which is not commutative, then we effectively proved that the axioms of a group are not sufficient for proving that for every $x$ and $y$ , $x*y=y*x$ . And indeed, it is not hard to find non-commutative groups. So, going back to $\\sf ZF$ and $\\Bbb Q$ -linear operators on $\\Bbb R$ . How would you prove that $\\sf ZF$ is not sufficient for proving the existence of such discontinuous operators? Well, you'd show that there are models of $\\sf ZF$ in which there are no such operators. Now we know that any $\\Bbb Q$ -linear operator which is also Baire measurable is continuous (one can also use Lebesgue measurability, for example). So if we can find a model of $\\sf ZF$ in which every such linear function is Baire measurable, then every such function is also continuous. And indeed, this was shown possible by Solovay, and later improved upon by Shelah. In other words, they exhibited models of $\\sf ZF$ in which every function $f\\colon\\Bbb{R\\to R}$ is Baire measurable, and in particular any $\\Bbb Q$ -linear operator. So every such operator is continuous. These constructions are extremely technical utilising not only the technique of forcing, but also extended techniques of symmetric extensions, and often relying on theorems in analysis as well. But with time, one can learn them. TL;DR : To prove that some axioms don't prove a statement, it is usually easier to prove that there is a model of the axioms where the statement is false. This is true for $\\sf ZF$ as well. To show that the axiom of choice is necessary for proving something we need to show that: $\\sf ZFC$ implies this something, and there is a model of $\\sf ZF$ where this something is false. The difficult part—conceptually—is getting your head around models of $\\sf ZF$ , because it's the foundation of mathematics. But once you've gone through that step, the rest is just a technicality.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking about proving that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of an additive function T: R → R that's not linear. They mention that in the example given, people say you can't construct such a function without AC, and they want to know how to prove the necessity of AC in such cases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The main task is to structure the problem according to the specified format, which includes listing assumptions and the problem statement. The example provided shows that assumptions are individual properties or conditions applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user is talking about the necessity of the axiom of choice in proving the existence of a non-linear additive function. So, the problem is to show that without AC, you can't prove that such a function exists. The assumptions would relate to the properties of the function and the axiomatic system in use.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in the problem, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the user's current question, there's no explicit assumption stated except for the general background. The user is more asking about the method to prove the necessity of AC in such proofs, rather than a specific mathematical problem with given assumptions. Hmm, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, the user provided their own example where they rephrased the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement. The original example was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91 with assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the user is referring to another question about additive functions and the necessity of AC. So, the task is to structure that specific problem (about additive functions and AC necessity) into the Assumption and Problem format.\n\nSo, the problem mentioned in the user's question is: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to show the existence of an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nThe assumptions here would be related to the function T. Let's break down the assumptions:\n\n1. T is a function from R to R.\n2. T is additive, i.e., T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all real numbers x and y.\n3. T is not linear, meaning there does not exist a constant c such that T(x) = cx for all x.\n\nBut the key point here is that the existence of such a T requires the axiom of choice. So, the problem is to prove that without AC, you cannot prove the existence of such a T. Therefore, the assumptions should include the properties of T (additive, not linear) and the fact that we are working in ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without AC). The problem is to show that AC is necessary for this proof.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- T: R → R is a function,\n- T is additive (T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x, y ∈ R),\n- T is not linear,\n- ZF set theory is the foundational system.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the axiom of choice is necessary to show the existence of such a function T.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's example had assumptions that were more about the objects in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, the assumptions would be about the function T and the axiomatic system. But the user's example included only the problem-relevant assumptions, perhaps not the meta-assumptions about the foundational system. However, in this case, since the problem is about the necessity of AC, the foundational system (ZF) is part of the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are about T's properties, and the problem is to show that AC is required for existence. But in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on the objects in the problem. So here, the function T has properties (additive, not linear), and the problem is to show that AC is necessary for its existence.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would list the properties of T and perhaps that we are working in ZF (since AC's necessity is about ZF vs ZFC). But the original example didn't mention the foundational system; perhaps the user expects only the mathematical assumptions. However, since the problem is about the necessity of an axiom, the foundational system is part of the context.\n\nBut the user's example didn't mention the underlying system for divisibility. The problem was about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions on n. Here, the necessity of AC is a metamathematical statement, so the assumptions might include that we're working in ZF without AC. But maybe the user wants the assumptions related to the function T. Let's think again.\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary in order to prove something else (existence of non-linear additive function).\n\nSo, the \"something else\" is the existence of a non-linear additive function T: R → R. So, the problem is: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of a function T: R → R that is additive and not linear.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- T is a function from R to R,\n- T is additive (T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)),\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of such T.\n\nBut perhaps the assumption should also include that we're working in ZF set theory, because the necessity of AC is relative to ZF. So, the necessity is that ZF cannot prove the existence of such T without AC. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- Working in ZF set theory (without AC),\n- T: R → R is additive,\n- T is not linear.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they didn't mention the foundational system. However, in this problem, since it's about the necessity of an axiom, the foundational system is part of the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to list the mathematical assumptions about T, and the problem is to prove that AC is necessary. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- T: R → R is a function,\n- T is additive,\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of T.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement should be: Prove that in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, it is impossible to prove the existence of an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nIn that case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- ZF set theory is the foundational system (without AC),\n- T: R → R is additive,\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the existence of such T cannot be proven without the axiom of choice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumptions: \n\n- ZF set theory (without AC) is consistent,\n- There exists an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary for the existence of T.\n\nBut I think the key here is to model the example given. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. In the current case, the problem is about showing AC is necessary for proving existence of T. So the assumptions would be the properties of T (additive, not linear) and perhaps the axiomatic framework (ZF). But in the example, the axiomatic framework wasn't mentioned because it wasn't relevant. Here, since it's about AC's necessity, the framework (ZF vs ZFC) is essential.\n\nTherefore, to structure it correctly:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The foundational system is ZF set theory without the axiom of choice,\n- T: R → R is a function,\n- T is additive (for all x, y ∈ R, T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)),\n- T is not linear (there is no constant c ∈ R such that T(x) = c x for all x ∈ R).\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of such a function T.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement in the example was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is to prove that AC is necessary. So the problem statement is \"Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary in order to prove the existence of an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\"\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are just about T's properties, and the problem is to show AC is needed. However, the necessity of AC is a metamathematical statement, so the assumptions would need to include that we're working in ZF. But in the example, assumptions were about the object (n), not the framework. Maybe in this case, the user wants the assumptions to be the properties of T, and the problem is to prove AC is necessary for its existence. But how to fit that into the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is: Prove that in ZF, the existence of a non-linear additive function on R implies the axiom of choice. But that's not exactly correct. The standard approach is to show that in ZF, one cannot prove the existence of such a function, but with AC (or with a weaker form), you can. So the necessity is that without AC, you can't prove existence. Therefore, to formalize the problem, maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- ZF set theory is consistent,\n- There exists an additive function T: R → R that is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary for such existence.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The user's example had specific mathematical assumptions on the objects involved, not on the axiomatic system. However, in this case, the problem inherently involves the axiomatic system. Maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- T is a function from R to R,\n- T is additive,\n- T is not linear.\n\nProblem: Prove that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of T.\n\nBut then, the problem is to show that without AC, you can't prove T exists. But in the format, the assumptions are about the objects in the problem. So perhaps the answer should list the properties of T as assumptions and the problem as proving AC's necessity.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a function from R to R,\nT is additive,\nT is not linear.\nProblem:\nProve that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of T.\n\nBut does this capture it correctly? In the example, assumptions were about n (integer, divisible by 7), leading to the problem. Here, the assumptions are about T (additive, not linear), leading to the problem of proving AC is necessary for its existence. However, the necessity of AC is a metamathematical statement, so maybe the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that the existence of T requires the axiom of choice,\" but the original question was about proving that AC is necessary to prove something else (the existence).\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nWorking in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice,\nT: R → R is additive,\nT is not linear.\nProblem:\nProve that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of T.\n\nBut the example didn't include the foundational system in assumptions. The user might prefer to keep assumptions as properties of the mathematical objects (T in this case), not the framework. But since the problem is about the framework's axioms, it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are only about T, and the problem is to show that AC is needed. The user's example had two assumptions on n (integer and divisible by 7) leading to the problem. Here, the assumptions are three: T is function R→R, additive, not linear. Problem: Prove AC is necessary for existence.\n\nBut I think this is the best approach. The user's example didn't mention the divisibility by 7 was part of the original problem's assumptions, but in their formatted version, they added it. Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, the assumption added n divisible by 7. Wait, that example might not be correctly formatted. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that n is any integer, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the formatted problem shouldn't add an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So maybe the example is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Maybe the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7. But the user wrote the original problem as \"for every integer n\". So there's inconsistency. Therefore, perhaps the example is not accurate. But regardless, the user's instruction is to follow the format, which in their example includes listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are the properties of T: additive, not linear, function from R to R. The problem is to show that AC is necessary to prove existence. Therefore, following the example's approach (even if the example itself is flawed), the formatted problem would list the properties of T as assumptions and the problem as proving AC is necessary.\n\nHence:\n\nAssumption:\nT is a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nT is additive (i.e., $T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$),\nT is not linear.\nProblem:\nProve that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove the existence of such a function $T$.",
