    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving an inequality involving three non-negative variables a, b, and c. The user wants the assumptions and the problem statement separated, with each assumption being a single condition on one object.\n\nFirst, the problem states that a, b, and c are non-negative numbers. So the assumptions should list each variable's non-negativity. However, the example given in the format had each assumption on separate lines, even if they're similar. Wait, in the example, the user wrote two assumptions for n: one that it's an integer and another that it's divisible by 7. But here, a, b, c are all non-negative. Should each be listed separately or combined? The example listed each condition separately even if they applied to the same object. So, in this case, each variable's non-negativity should be a separate assumption.\n\nSo Assumptions:\n- a is a non-negative number,\n- b is a non-negative number,\n- c is a non-negative number.\n\nThen the problem is the inequality as stated. The original problem mentions \"non-negative numbers,\" which includes zero and positive real numbers. There's no mention of other conditions like symmetry or homogeneity, so maybe that's all. The user's example didn't include implicit assumptions, just the explicit ones from the problem statement. So I should stick to exactly what's given.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove that the sum a√(a² + bc) + ... is greater than or equal to the square root term. So the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed each on their own line, even if they are similar, and then the problem statement.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check again. The example had assumptions split into separate lines, even if they apply to the same variable. So here, three separate lines for a, b, c each being non-negative. The problem is the inequality as given. There's no additional conditions mentioned, like a + b + c = 1 or anything else. So the assumptions are just the non-negativity of each variable.",
