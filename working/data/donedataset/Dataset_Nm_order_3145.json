    "AcceptedAnswer": "In this answer , I show that $\\zeta(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}$, and that $$\\zeta^{'}(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi ).$$\nPlugging these in yields $$\\left(4^{\\zeta(0)}e^{-\\zeta^{'}(0)}\\right)^{2}=4^{-1}e^{\\log(2\\pi)}=4^{-1}\\cdot2\\pi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$$  Also of interest is part $4$ of my answer regarding the evaluation of $\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right).$ Proving that $\\zeta(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}.$ The Riemann zeta function is defined as $\\zeta(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}n^{-s}.$ Writing this as a Riemann Stieltjies integral and applying integration by parts we have that $$\\zeta(s)=\\int_{1}^{\\infty}x^{-s}d\\left[x\\right]=\\int_{1}^{\\infty}x^{-s}dx-\\int_{1}^{\\infty}x^{-s}d\\left\\{ x\\right\\}$$ $$=\\frac{s}{s-1}-s\\int_{1}^{\\infty}\\left\\{ x\\right\\} x^{-s-1}dx,$$ and this holds for all $\\text{Re}(s)>0.$ Notice that taking the limit as $s\\rightarrow0$ and being careful with the canceling singularities  yields $$\\zeta(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}.$$ Proving that $\\zeta^{'}(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi).$ Recall the functional equation for the zeta function, $$\\zeta(z)=2^{z}\\pi^{z-1}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(1-z\\right)\\zeta\\left(1-z\\right).$$ Taking the logarithmic derivative, we have that $$\\frac{\\zeta^{'}(z)}{\\zeta(z)}=\\log2+\\log\\pi-\\frac{\\Gamma^{'}\\left(1-z\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1-z\\right)}+\\frac{d}{dz}\\log\\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)\\zeta\\left(1-z\\right)\\right).$$ Since $\\zeta(1-z)=-\\frac{1}{z}+\\gamma+O(z),$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\pi z}{2}+O\\left(z^{3}\\right),$ we have that $$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)\\zeta\\left(1-z\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{2}z+O\\left(z^{2}\\right),$$ and so $$\\frac{d}{dz}\\log\\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\right)\\zeta\\left(1-z\\right)\\right)=\\frac{-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{2}+O\\left(z\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+O\\left(z\\right)}=-\\gamma+O(z).$$ Thus $$\\frac{\\zeta^{'}(0)}{\\zeta(0)}=\\log2\\pi-\\Gamma^{'}\\left(1\\right)-\\gamma.$$ As $\\Gamma^{'}(1)=-\\gamma,$ and $\\zeta(0)=-\\frac{1}{2},$ we conclude that $$\\zeta^{'}(0)=-\\frac{1}{2}\\log2\\pi.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange problem into the specified format. The example they provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem here is about proving a Wallis formula involving the Riemann zeta function at 0 and its derivative.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem statement is asking to prove an equality involving ζ(0) and ζ’(0). So, the main objects here are the Riemann zeta function ζ and its derivative at 0. The assumptions might relate to the properties of ζ(s) at s=0 and the value of its derivative there. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state any conditions, so I need to infer the necessary assumptions based on standard mathematical knowledge.\n\nIn the example given, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about ζ(0) and ζ’(0). The Riemann zeta function has analytic continuation, and at s=0, ζ(0) is known to be -1/2. The derivative ζ’(0) is related to ln(2π) from the functional equation. So, the assumptions would involve the values of ζ(0) and ζ’(0) which are standard results in analytic number theory. Since the problem is to prove the formula using these values, the assumptions should state the known values of ζ(0) and ζ’(0).\n\nTherefore, each assumption line should state the value of ζ(0) and ζ’(0) separately. That's two assumptions. The problem then is to prove the given equation using those values. So, putting it all together, the assumptions are ζ(0) = -1/2 and ζ’(0) = -ln(2π)/2. Then the problem is to square the expression 4^{ζ(0)}·e^{-ζ’(0)} and show it equals π/2. Let me check if these values are correct. Yes, ζ(0) = -1/2 from the analytic continuation, and ζ’(0) = - (1/2) ln(2π) as per the functional equation's derivative. So substituting those into the expression should yield sqrt(pi/2) squared, which is pi/2. Wait, but the left-hand side is squared. Let me compute 4^{ζ(0)} = 4^{-1/2} = 1/2. Then e^{-ζ’(0)} = e^{(ln(2π)/2)} = sqrt(2π). So multiplying them gives (1/2)*sqrt(2π) = sqrt(π/2). Then squaring that gives π/2. So the steps make sense. Therefore, the key assumptions are the specific values of ζ(0) and ζ’(0). The problem doesn't state these assumptions explicitly, but they are necessary to solve it. Therefore, the formatted problem should list these two assumptions.",
