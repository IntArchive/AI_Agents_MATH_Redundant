    "Content": "Galois Group of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}$ is cumbersome to computing. Is easy to find the all four possible candidates but is cumberstone to show that they are automorphisms: For multiplication is too long showing that $f((a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})(a'+b'\\sqrt{2}+c'\\sqrt{3}+d'\\sqrt{6}))=f(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})f(a'+b'\\sqrt{2}+c'\\sqrt{3}+d'\\sqrt{6})$ For some non trivial candidate since the left hand side expands in $16$ terms. What about $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5}):\\mathbb{Q}$? there are $7$ non trivial candidates and multiplication expands in $64$ terms! How to do it in a tricker form? Edit(Let me be more precise in my question): I know that if $f\\in\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q})$, then $f(\\sqrt{2})=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$, $f(\\sqrt{3})=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ so there are $4$ candidates for $\\mathbb{Q}$-Automorphisms. Candidates are given by: $f_1(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})=a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6}$ $f_2(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})=a-b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}-d\\sqrt{6}$ $f_3(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})=a+b\\sqrt{2}-c\\sqrt{3}-d\\sqrt{6}$ $f_4(a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6})=a-b\\sqrt{2}-c\\sqrt{3}+d\\sqrt{6}$ But I need to check that they are $\\mathbb{Q}$-Automorphisms in $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. All candidates $f_i$ fixes $\\mathbb{Q}$ and is obvious that all preserves sums, $f_1$ obviously preserves product also since is the identity, but is cumberstone to show that $f_i(xy)=f_i(x)_if(y)$ to conclude $f_i\\in\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q})$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "To reiterate a point in @ErikVesterlund's comment, as well as Andrea Mori's and Ayman Hourieh's answers: there is no need to \"directly\" verify that the indicated maps are $\\mathbb Q$ homomorphisms, because we have already proven this indirectly, by invoking the main theorem of Galois theory, in effect. That is, we show that the degree of the extension really is what it appears to be. Then, observe that any Galois automorphism must permute roots of irreducibles over the base, so _at_most_ $\\sqrt{2}\\rightarrow \\pm \\sqrt{2}$, and similarly for any other square roots. Thus, in your first example, there are _at_most_ these four. But/and Galois theory says there _at_least_ four, so these four must be \"it\". Similarly in the second example, after showing that the field extension really is of degree $2^3$, again we see that there are _at_most_ the $8$ automorphisms that flip the signs of the $3$ square roots, and Galois theory say there are _at_least_ $8$, so those must be \"it\". No explicit verification that multiplication is preserved is needed!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about computing the Galois group of Q(√2, √3) over Q and mentions difficulties in verifying automorphisms. Also, there's a part about Q(√2, √3, √5) over Q.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unrelated information. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition for one object. The problem statement is then concise.\n\nLooking at the original question, the main problem is about showing that the four candidates for automorphisms in the Galois group of Q(√2, √3) over Q are indeed automorphisms without expanding all terms. The user mentions that checking the multiplicative property for each candidate is cumbersome because of the 16 terms. They also ask about the case with three square roots, which expands to 64 terms.\n\nThe assumptions here would include the properties of the field extensions and the automorphisms. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The field extension is Q(√2, √3) over Q.\n2. Each Q-automorphism f must fix Q.\n3. Automorphisms are determined by their action on generators √2 and √3.\n4. Possible actions are f(√2) = ±√2 and f(√3) = ±√3.\n5. There are four candidates for automorphisms based on these actions.\n6. Each candidate preserves addition.\n7. The identity automorphism obviously preserves multiplication.\n8. Verifying multiplicative preservation for non-identity candidates requires checking f(xy) = f(x)f(y).\n\nBut the problem statement is to show these candidates are automorphisms without expanding all terms. The user is seeking a trickier method than brute force.\n\nSo, the assumptions should list each of these conditions. However, some might be redundant or part of the problem's setup. For example, the field extension being Q(√2, √3)/Q is given. The automorphisms fix Q, which is a standard assumption in Galois theory. The possible actions on the generators are part of the problem's setup.\n\nIn the example provided earlier, assumptions were listed as individual conditions. Here, the key assumptions would be:\n\n- The field extension is Q(√2, √3) over Q.\n- Each Q-automorphism must fix Q element-wise.\n- Automorphisms are determined by their action on √2 and √3.\n- Possible images of √2 are ±√2.\n- Possible images of √3 are ±√3.\n- There are four candidate functions based on these images.\n- Each candidate is a Q-linear map that preserves addition.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that these four candidates are Q-automorphisms (i.e., they also preserve multiplication) without expanding all terms in the product.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the user already knows that the candidates fix Q and preserve addition. The main issue is verifying the multiplicative property. So perhaps the problem is specifically about verifying that these candidates preserve multiplication without the tedious expansion.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include that the candidates fix Q, preserve addition, and are defined by their action on the generators. The problem is to show they preserve multiplication, hence are automorphisms.\n\nTherefore, structuring it:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The field extension is ℚ(√2, √3) over ℚ.\n- Each ℚ-automorphism must fix ℚ element-wise.\n- Automorphisms of ℚ(√2, √3) are determined by their action on √2 and √3.\n- Possible images of √2 under an automorphism are ±√2.\n- Possible images of √3 under an automorphism are ±√3.\n- There are four candidate functions f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄ defined by mapping √2 and √3 to their ± counterparts.\n- Each candidate function is a ℚ-linear map that preserves addition.\n\nProblem:\nProve that each candidate function f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄ is a ℚ-automorphism by showing they preserve multiplication without expanding all terms in the product.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem mentions the cumbersome verification, the problem could be phrased as asking for a method to verify the multiplicative property efficiently.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is that they have the four candidates but find it cumbersome to check the multiplicative property. So the problem is to show these candidates are automorphisms (i.e., preserve multiplication) without the lengthy expansion.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would have assumptions about the setup and the candidates, then the problem is to prove they are automorphisms efficiently.\n\nAlso, note the user's edit clarifies they know the candidates are determined by ± on the roots but need to check they are automorphisms. So the key task is proving the multiplicative property.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should capture these elements.",
