    "Content": "Suppouse $A \\in \\mathbb R^n$ is convex. If $f:A\\to\\mathbb R$ is strictly convex, show that the set of minimizers if either a singleton or empty. Ok, Suppose there exist more than one minimizer, then $f(x_i)\\le f(x)\\: \\forall x\\in B_r(x_i),\\: r\\gt 0$ where $x_i$ is a minimizer. Therefore there exist $x_j\\:s.t\\:f''(x_j)\\lt0$ , which is a contradiction. I understand intuitively why this is so but i think my proof is wrong Any help would be appreciated Thanks",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Suppose that f has a local minimum at $x_1$ and also another local minimum at $x_2$ with the condition that $$f(x_1)\\le f(x_2) \\quad x_1\\ne x_2 $$\nThe definition of strict convexity is\n$$f\\big(h\\ x_1+(1-h)x_2\\big)\\lt h\\ f(x_1)+(1-h)f(x_2)\\qquad 0\\lt h\\lt 1$$\nSince h is positive\n$$f(x_1)\\le f(x_2) \\Rightarrow h\\ f(x_1)\\le h\\ f(x_2)$$\nwhich justifies below condition\n$$h\\ f(x_1)+(1-h)f(x_2)\\le h\\ f(x_2)+(1-h)f(x_2)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow h\\ f(x_1)+(1-h)f(x_2)\\le f(x_2)$$\nReplacing this condition to the definition of convexity\n$$f\\big(h\\ x_1+(1-h)x_2\\big)\\lt f(x_2)$$\nIf $x_2$ is a local minimum the neighborhood must be defined such as $f(x)\\gt f(x_2)$ which is a contradiction with the above condition. To satisfy both conditions it must be that $x_1=x_2$ which shows that f has at most one local minimum.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given question from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"If $f$ is strictly convex in a convex set, show it has no more than 1 minimum\". The problem statement says that $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is convex, and $f: A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly convex. The goal is to show that the set of minimizers is either a singleton or empty. The user's attempt mentions assuming multiple minimizers and then deriving a contradiction with the second derivative being negative, but they think their proof is wrong.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The key points here are:\n\n1. $A$ is a convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. That's one assumption about the domain of $f$.\n2. The function $f$ is strictly convex. That's another assumption about the function's property.\n3. The problem is to show that the set of minimizers (points where $f$ attains its minimum) is either a single point or empty. So the problem is to prove this statement.\n\nThe example provided in the original query lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. So for this problem, the two main assumptions are the convexity of set $A$ and the strict convexity of function $f$. The problem is to show the minimizers are a singleton or empty.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any irrelevant information. The user's attempt in the question mentions specific steps, like $f''(x_j) < 0$, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So those shouldn't be in the assumptions section. The assumptions are only what's given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\n$A$ is a convex subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\n$f: A \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly convex.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the set of minimizers of $f$ is either a singleton or empty.\n\nI should check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an expression and mentioned divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that $n$ is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, similarly, the key given conditions are the convex set and strict convexity of the function. The problem is to show the minimizers are singleton or empty. So I think that's correct.\n\nNo other assumptions seem necessary. The problem doesn't mention differentiability or twice differentiability, so those are not part of the given assumptions. Strict convexity is a property that can be defined without differentiability, so the user's mention of $f''$ might be part of their approach, but it's not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the structured problem should only include the convex set and the strictly convex function.",
