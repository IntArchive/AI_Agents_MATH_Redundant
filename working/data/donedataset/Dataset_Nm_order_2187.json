    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read the original question carefully. The user is asking to prove that a symmetric matrix with at least one positive diagonal entry has at least one positive eigenvalue. The title and the question mention that A is an n×n symmetric matrix, and there exists some i such that a_{ii} > 0. The hint provided is about e_i^T * A * e_i equals a_{ii}, which probably relates to quadratic forms or eigenvalues.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that A is a symmetric matrix of size n×n. That's one assumption. Then, there exists at least one diagonal entry a_{ii} that is positive. So another assumption is that for some i, a_{ii} > 0. Are there any other assumptions? The problem doesn't mention anything else, like the field being real numbers, but since it's about eigenvalues and symmetric matrices, we can assume it's over the real numbers. However, the user might not have specified that, so maybe I shouldn't add that unless it's explicitly stated. The original problem just says \"symmetric matrix,\" which in standard contexts is over the reals, but maybe the user hasn't considered complex. Wait, eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices are real, so that's important. But since the problem is stated as is, maybe I should stick to the given info.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n1. A is an n×n symmetric matrix.\n2. There exists at least one i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_{ii} > 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that A has at least one positive eigenvalue.\n\nWait, in the example given, the original problem had an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, the user just said \"for every integer n\". But in the formatted problem, the assistant included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that example might have been from a different problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, no, the original problem in the example says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Hmm, perhaps the user intended to structure a problem where the original problem might have had a typo or missing condition. But regardless, in the current problem, I need to stick to the original question's information.\n\nSo the original question states: A is symmetric, n×n, and has a positive diagonal entry. The problem is to prove that A has at least one positive eigenvalue. There are no additional hidden assumptions given. So the assumptions should be exactly those two points: symmetric matrix, and existence of a positive diagonal entry.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n symmetric matrix,\nThere exists some i such that a_{ii} > 0.\nProblem:\nProve that A has a positive eigenvalue.\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on its own line and addresses one property. The first line is about the matrix being symmetric and n×n. The second is about the existence of a positive diagonal entry. That should be correct.",
