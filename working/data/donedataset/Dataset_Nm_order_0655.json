    "Content": "Recently, I encountered a strange series involving Harmonic Numbers and Binomial Coefficients both. According to Mathematica : $$\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} \\pi}{27}(\\log (3)-2)+\\frac{2}{27} \\left( \\psi_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\right)-\\psi_1 \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right)\\right)$$ Here $\\psi_n(z)$ denotes the Polygamma Function . Can anybody provide a nice proof of the above statement? My Failed Attempt Using the Beta-function identity,\n$$\\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}}=(2n+1)\\int_0^1 y^n(1-y)^n \\ dy$$ $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{\\binom{2n}{n}} &= \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (2n+1)H_n \\int_0^1 (y-y^2)^n dy \\\\  &= \\int_0^1 \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (2n+1)H_n (y-y^2)^n \\ dy \\end{aligned}$$ Here, I used the identity $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty (2n+1)H_n t^n=\\frac{2t-(1+t)\\log(1-t)}{(t-1)^2}\\quad |t|<1$$ and got $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{\\binom{2n}{n}}=\\int_0^1 \\frac{2y-2y^2-(1+y-y^2)\\log(y^2-y+1)}{(y^2-y+1)^2}dy$$ How should I continue from here? I tried making some substitutions but nothing worked. Am I going in the right direction? Please help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Note: there is a minus sign missing in front of the 1st term on the left side of your evaluation. Put the integral into the form\n$$I=\\int_0^{1}\\frac{\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)\\ln\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)-2\\ln\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)-2\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)+2}{\\left(y^2-y+1\\right)^2}dy.$$\nMaking the change of variable $y=\\frac12+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\tan\\varphi$ (so that $y^2-y+1=\\frac{3}{4\\cos^2\\varphi}$) and simplifying, this reduces to\n$$I=\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\left\\{\\Bigl(\\frac34-2\\cos^2 \\varphi\\right)\\left(\\ln 3-2-2\\ln (2\\cos \\varphi)\\Bigr)-2\\cos^2 \\varphi\\right\\}d\\varphi.\\tag{1}$$\nThe only nontrivial integrals here are of the form\n$$\\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\ln (2\\cos \\varphi)\\,d\\varphi,\\qquad \\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\left(2\\cos^2\\varphi-1\\right)\\ln (2\\cos \\varphi)\\,d\\varphi.$$\nThe second integral can be easily done by parts - it is equal to \n\\begin{align}\\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\left(2\\cos^2\\varphi-1\\right)\\ln (2\\cos \\varphi)\\,d\\varphi&=\\Bigl[\\sin\\varphi\\cos\\varphi\\ln(2\\cos \\varphi)\\Bigr]^{\\pi/6}_{-\\pi/6}+\\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\sin^2\\varphi\\,d\\varphi=\\\\&=\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\ln3-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}.\n\\end{align}\nUsing this in (1), we reduce it to\n$$I=\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3}}\\left[\\frac{\\pi\\left(2-\\ln3\\right)}{12}+\\frac12\\int_{-\\pi/6}^{\\pi/6}\\ln(2\\cos\\varphi)\\,d\\varphi\\right].$$\nTherefore, the proof of your identity reduces to showing that\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/6}\\ln(2\\cos\\varphi)\\,d\\varphi=\\frac{\\psi_1\\left(\\frac13\\right)-\\psi_1\\left(\\frac23\\right)}{12\\sqrt{3}},\\tag{2}$$\nHowever, the left side is clearly expressible in terms of polylogarithms, so (2) should follow from their known special values.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original question is about proving a specific series involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Looking at the problem here: the series is from n=1 to infinity, involving H_n (harmonic numbers) and binomial coefficients (2n choose n). The question mentions using the Beta-function identity and an identity for the generating function of (2n+1)H_n t^n. The user also substituted variables and arrived at an integral, but is stuck there.\n\nAssumptions here might include that H_n is the nth harmonic number, the series is over positive integers starting at 1, and that certain convergence conditions hold for the series (like |t| <1 for the generating function). However, the example given in the problem didn't list convergence as an assumption but rather specific properties. The problem doesn't state any additional conditions on n beyond it being a summation index. The main objects here are the harmonic numbers H_n and the binomial coefficients. The integral substitution uses the Beta function identity, but that's part of the problem's setup rather than an assumption. \n\nSo, possible assumptions:\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n- The series is summed from n=1 to infinity.\n- The binomial coefficient is (2n choose n).\n- The integral representation of 1/(2n choose n) is valid.\n- The generating function identity for sum (2n+1)H_n t^n holds for |t| <1.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are more about the conditions on the variables involved. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't specify conditions on n beyond being a summation index. The harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients are defined as usual. The integral from 0 to 1 is part of the method, not an assumption. The generating function identity's validity (|t|<1) is important, but since y(1-y) ranges between 0 and 0.25 when y is in [0,1], so t = y(1-y) would satisfy |t| <1, so that condition is met. However, the example didn't include such convergence conditions in assumptions. Maybe the assumptions here are just the definitions and the objects involved.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n- H_n denotes the nth harmonic number.\n- The summation is over all positive integers n starting from 1.\n- The binomial coefficient is given by (2n choose n).\n- The integral representation 1/(2n choose n) = (2n+1) ∫₀¹ yⁿ(1−y)ⁿ dy is valid.\n- The generating function sum_{n=1}^∞ (2n+1)H_n t^n = [2t − (1 + t) log(1 − t)] / (t − 1)^2 for |t| < 1.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were very concise, only listing the variables' conditions. Maybe in this case, the problem is to prove the given expression for the series, so the assumptions are the definitions of the components. The problem mentions using the Beta function identity and the generating function identity, but these are part of the attempted solution, not assumptions of the problem itself. The user is asking for a proof of the given sum expression. So perhaps the key assumptions are the definitions of H_n, the binomial coefficient, and the series sum from n=1 to infinity. However, the problem as stated in the original question is to prove the equality to the given expression involving polygamma functions. Therefore, the problem is to prove that sum equals that expression. The assumptions would be the components involved in the problem statement. \n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nH_n is the nth harmonic number,\nThe summation index n ranges over positive integers starting from 1,\nThe binomial coefficient is defined as $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$,\nThe polygamma function $\\psi_1(z)$ is used.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{\\tbinom{2n}{n}} = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} \\pi}{27}(\\log (3)-2)+\\frac{2}{27} \\left( \\psi_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\right)-\\psi_1 \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right)\\right).$$\n\nWait, but the original problem's title mentions it's a challenging Euler sum. The user also provided their failed attempt using Beta function and generating functions. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the attempt. The example had assumptions about the variable (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, maybe the only assumptions are the definitions: H_n is harmonic number, the binomial coefficient is as defined, and the sum is over n starting at 1. The problem is to prove the equality to that polygamma expression.\n\nSo I think that's the correct approach. The assumptions are the definitions of the components involved. So each assumption line would be:\n\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n- The series is summed over all positive integers n starting from 1.\n- The binomial coefficient is $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$.\n- The polygamma function $\\psi_1(z)$ is used in the expression.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the variable's properties. However, in the original example, the problem was about proving divisibility by 91, and the user added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 (which may not have been in the original problem but was part of the solution's needs). Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", so maybe the formatted example is wrong? Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem doesn't mention n being divisible by 7. This seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nThis seems like a mistake, because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. But perhaps the example given by the user is erroneous, but in the task, I should follow the user's example structure, even if it's wrong.\n\nWait, no. The user provided the example as part of the instructions. So in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". This suggests that perhaps the user intended to filter out some conditions, but in reality, the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, and the conclusion is divisibility by 91. But the formatted problem in the example adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the user is showing that sometimes you have to extract implicit assumptions. But in this case, the original problem has no such assumption. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. \n\nBut given that, in the current problem, the user's example includes adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", perhaps the task is to list all conditions that are necessary for the problem to hold, which may not all be stated explicitly in the original problem. However, in the current problem, the question is to prove the given equality, which involves polygamma functions. The problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on n except that the sum is from 1 to infinity. The harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients are standard. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n- The summation is over positive integers n ≥ 1.\n- The binomial coefficient is $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$.\n- The polygamma function $\\psi_1(z)$ is defined as the first derivative of the digamma function.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions that ψ₁ denotes the polygamma function, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem statement. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties, not the definitions of functions. So perhaps here, the key assumption is that H_n is the harmonic number and the sum is over n starting at 1. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves an infinite series, an assumption could be that the series converges. But the example didn't include convergence as an assumption. \n\nGiven the example's structure, which lists assumptions about the variable (n is integer, n divisible by 7), perhaps in this problem, the assumptions are about the variables involved. However, in this case, the variable n is a summation index, so it's a positive integer. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n- The binomial coefficient $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$ is defined as (2n)!/(n!)^2.\n\nBut the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7). So maybe the task is to list any underlying assumptions needed for the problem, even if they are implicit. However, in the current problem, the original question doesn't state any restrictions beyond n being a summation index starting at 1. So the main assumptions are that n is a positive integer, H_n is the harmonic number, the binomial coefficient is as defined, and the series converges (though convergence might be part of the problem's requirements to be proven, but since the problem is to prove the equality, maybe convergence is assumed).\n\nBut the example didn't include convergence. So perhaps the assumptions here are simply:\n\n- H_n is the nth harmonic number.\n- The summation index n ranges over positive integers starting from 1.\n- The binomial coefficient $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$ is used.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove the given equality involving the polygamma functions. The polygamma functions are part of the answer, so their definition is given in the problem statement, so maybe that's not an assumption. \n\nSo after considering all this, I think the formatted problem should have assumptions listing the components involved (H_n, binomial coefficient, summation range) and the problem is to prove the equality. \n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$H_n$ is the nth harmonic number,\nThe summation is over all positive integers $n$ starting from 1,\nThe binomial coefficient is given by $\\tbinom{2n}{n}$,\n$\\psi_1(z)$ denotes the polygamma function.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{H_n}{\\tbinom{2n}{n}} = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} \\pi}{27}(\\log (3)-2)+\\frac{2}{27} \\left( \\psi_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\right)-\\psi_1 \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right)\\right).$$",
