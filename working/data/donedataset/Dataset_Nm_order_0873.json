    "Content": "Let $x+y+z=3,x,y,z\\ge 0$,show that\n  $$\\sqrt{x^2+yz+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+zx+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+xy+2}\\ge 6$$ Additional information I have seen the following problem: $x,y,z>0,x+y+z=3$, prove that\n$$\\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\\ge 6.$$ Without loss of generality we can let $x=\\max{\\{x,y,z\\}}$ Proof : case 1\n$x\\ge y\\ge z$ we can easily prove \n$$\\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\\ge\\sqrt{y^2+x+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+z+2}$$ and\n$$\\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+x+2}\\ge\\sqrt{x^2+x+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+y+2}$$ so we have\n$$\\sqrt{x^2+y+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+z+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+x+2}\\ge \\sqrt{x^2+x+2}+\\sqrt{y^2+y+2}+\\sqrt{z^2+z+2}.$$ Then use\n$$\\sqrt{x^2+x+2}\\ge\\dfrac{3}{4}x+\\dfrac{5}{4}$$\n$$\\sqrt{y^2+y+2}\\ge\\dfrac{3}{4}y+\\dfrac{5}{4}$$\n$$\\sqrt{z^2+z+2}\\ge\\dfrac{3}{4}z+\\dfrac{5}{4}$$\nto get the result. Whereas the case 2 when $x\\ge z\\ge y$ can be proved using the same methods. Now,I have another idea: using Holder inequality\nwe have\n$$\\left(\\sum\\sqrt{x^2+yz+2}\\right)^2\\left(\\sum\\dfrac{x^2+2yz+9}{x^2+yz+2}\\right)\\ge 36^3$$\n$$\\Longleftrightarrow \\sum\\dfrac{x^2+2yz+9}{x^2+yz+2}\\le 1296$$ and  the following link has some discussion about this problem http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=538230 and http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&t=538752&p=3097872#p3097872 and Vasc gave the hint: $$\\sum\\sqrt{8(a^2+bc+2)}\\ge \\sum\\sqrt{(3a+b+c)^2+7}\\ge 12\\sqrt 2$$ How prove this hint?Thank you everyone. and my other idea is as follows: let $a=\\min(a,b,c)$\nwe can prove \n$$\\sqrt{b^2+ca+2}+\\sqrt{c^2+ab+2}\\geq \\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8-(b-c)^2}\\tag{1}$$\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\sqrt{a^2+bc+2}+\\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8-(b-c)^2}\\\\\n\\geq &\\sqrt{a^2+\\frac{(b+c)^2}{4}+2}+\\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*}\nSumming up\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\sum_{cyc}{\\sqrt{a^2+bc+2}}\\\\\n\\geq &\\sqrt{a^2+\\frac{(b+c)^2}{4}+2}+\\sqrt{(b+c)^2+2a(b+c)+8}\\\\\n=&\\sqrt{a^2+\\frac{(3-a)^2}{4}+2}+\\sqrt{(3-a)^2+2a(3-a)+8}\n\\end{align*} By the way: someone said $(1)$ is wrong? why? can anyone give an example? And hopefully someone can use this method to prove this inequality? Thank you very much!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is an explanation of Vasc's hint that you mentioned, which essentially solves the problem. Reproducing it here as:\n$$\\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{8\\left(x^2+ \\text{yz} + 2\\right)}\\geq  \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(3x+y+z)^2+7} = \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(2x+3)^2+7}\\geq  12\\sqrt{2}$$ Now the last inequality follows immediately from Minkowski's inequality and $\\sum x=3$, so I will focus only on the first inequality below. The inequality $\\displaystyle \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{8\\left(x^2+ \\text{yz} + 2\\right)}\\geq \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(2x+3)^2+7}$ can be established through Schur-concavity of the vector function $f{(\\color{blue}{u}}) = \\sqrt{u_1}+\\sqrt{u_2}+\\sqrt{u_3}$. This function is symmetric and concave, hence Schur-concave.  Alternately it is not difficult to establish the condition\n$$\\left(u_i- u_j\\right)\\left(\\partial _{u_i}f-\\partial _{u_j}f\\right) = -\\frac{\\left(u_i- u_j\\right){}^2}{\\sqrt{u_i u_j}} \\leq  0.$$ << If you are not familiar with Schur-concave property, it should be possible to derive similar results using the lemma $\\sqrt{x-\\epsilon }+\\sqrt{y+\\epsilon }\\geq  \\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}$.  This is easily shown to hold if $x-y \\ge \\epsilon \\ge 0$ by squaring. Using the sequence $$[x, y, z] \\succ [x - u, y + u, z] \\succ [x - u, \n  y + u - (v + u), z + (u + v)]$$ and applying the lemma twice, one can establish $$\\sqrt{x-u}+\\sqrt{y-v}+\\sqrt{z+u+v}\\geq  \\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}+\\sqrt{z}$$ and the conditions needed.>> As $f{(\\color{blue}{u}})$ is Schur-concave, if we have $\\color{blue}{a} \\text{ and } \\color{blue}{b}$ two vectors such that $\\color{blue}{a}$ majorizes $\\color{blue}{b}$, i.e. $\\color{blue}{a} \\succ  \\color{blue}{b} \\implies f(\\color{blue}{a})\\leq  f(\\color{blue}{b})$.    In this case we need to show that considered as vectors,\n$$\\left[(2x+3)^2+7,(2y+3)^2+7, (2z+3)^2+7\\right] \\succ \\left[8\\left(x^2+\\text{yz}+2\\right),8\\left(y^2+\\text{zx}+2\\right), 8\\left(z^2+\\text{xy}+2\\right)\\right]$$ If $s = xy+yz+zx$, we have\n$$\\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{8\\left(x^2+\\text{yz}+2\\right)}= \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{8x^2+8\\text{yz} + (x+y+z)^2+7} = \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(3x+y+z)^2+7+ 4(2\\text{yz}- \\text{xy}-\\text{zx})} = \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(2x+3)^2+7+ 4(3\\text{yz}-s)}$$ Let $\\displaystyle a = (2x+3)^2+7, b = (2y+3)^2 + 7 \\text{ and } c = (2z+3)^2+7$.  Also let $u = 4(s-3\\text{yz}) \\text{ and } v = 4(s-3\\text{zx})$.  Now $\\displaystyle x \\geq  y \\geq  z \\Longrightarrow  \\text{xy} \\geq  \\text{zx} \\geq  \\text{yz} \\Longrightarrow  u \\geq  0$ and $u+v \\geq 0$ and the deviations are in reverse order to the ordering of $a, b, c$- hence giving the conditions needed for majorization.  It may be noted that in a crude sense, the deviations have mean $0$, and are ordered so as to bring the components \"closer\", hence increasing the concave function's value. As $[a, b, c] \\succ  [a-u, b-v, c+(u+v)]$, we have $\\displaystyle \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{8\\left(x^2+ \\text{yz} + 2\\right)}\\geq  \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{(2x+3)^2+7}$. Hope there is a simpler method to establish this.  Another possible approach could be to directly check if $\\displaystyle F(x, y, z) = \\sum _{\\text{cyc}} \\sqrt{x^2+ \\text{yz} + 2}$ is Schur-convex, in which case any allowable $[x, y, z]\\succ  [1, 1, 1]$ and the entire proof is done.  $F$ is symmetric, but we also need to check if $x-y)\\left(\\partial _xF -\\partial _yF\\right)\\geq  0$ for this.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given problem according to the specified format. Let me read through the original question and the additional information carefully.\n\nThe original problem states: Let x, y, z ≥ 0 with x + y + z = 3. Show that the sum of sqrt(x² + yz + 2) cyclically is at least 6. \n\nThe user mentions additional problems and some methods tried, like Holder's inequality and a hint from Vasc. There are also some attempts with case analysis and inequalities, but these might be part of the user's own attempts rather than the problem's assumptions. \n\nThe task is to filter out the problem's assumptions and present the problem concisely. The assumptions should list each condition on the variables. The variables are non-negative (x, y, z ≥ 0) and their sum is 3 (x + y + z = 3). Each of these should be separate assumptions. The problem is to prove the inequality involving the sum of the square roots.\n\nI need to ensure that only the necessary conditions from the problem statement are included, not the additional methods or attempts mentioned. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. x, y, z are non-negative real numbers.\n2. x + y + z = 3.\n\nThe problem is to show that the cyclic sum of sqrt(x² + yz + 2) is greater than or equal to 6.\n\nChecking the example provided, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one condition. Here, two conditions: variables are non-negative and their sum is 3. The problem statement is the inequality to prove.\n\nI should avoid including the user's attempts, other problems, or methods like Holder's inequality or Vasc's hint, as those are part of the solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nx, y, z are non-negative real numbers,\nx + y + z = 3.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\sqrt{x^2 + yz + 2} + \\sqrt{y^2 + zx + 2} + \\sqrt{z^2 + xy + 2} \\ge 6.$$\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is on a separate line and only states the conditions given in the problem.
