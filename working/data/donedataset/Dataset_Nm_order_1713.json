    "Content": "I am working on some things related to arithmetic derivatives, and I was writing a program to calculate the arithmetic derivative. In working on my program I came across an assumption that I have made, but I could not prove that it was true and it was quite frustrating to me. My hypothesis is for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest number, $a \\in \\mathbb{N}/\\{1\\}$ such that $a \\vert n$ should be prime. My beginning of a proof for this was this Using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}/\\{1\\}$, that either $n$ is prime, or that $n$ has a unique prime factorization. If $n$ is prime, the proof is trivial, as the prime factorization for all $p \\in \\mathbb{P}$ is just $p$; however, for the case of $n$ being composite, the proof became quite difficult for me. For the case of a number $c$ such that $c \\in \\mathbb{N}/\\{1\\}$ and $c \\notin \\mathbb{P}$, we can say that there exists at least two numbers, $a$ and $b$ such that fulfill the following four statement $1 < a \\le b < c$ $a \\vert c$ $b \\vert c$ $ab = c$ My thought process thereby went into dividing $c$ into odds and evens. We can say that this theorem is true for all even numbers, $e$, rather trivially as well because for all $e \\in \\{2k:\\mathbb{N}/\\{1\\}\\}$ that $2\\vert e$ and $2$ is also the smallest integer that could possibly fulfill the above criteria thereby making $a = 2$ and fulfilling the theorem for all even numbers. The part that I cannot figure out however is odd numbers. My intuition is telling me this must be true, but I cannot figure out a proof of this theorem for odds and I was wondering if Is this theorem actually true? If so, how can this be proven for odds?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $n\\in\\Bbb N$ and let $a\\in\\Bbb N\\setminus\\{1\\}$ be the smallest divisor of $n$. If $a$ is prime, you're done. If not, then $a$ is composite, and so can be written $a = bc$ for $b,c\\in\\Bbb N\\setminus\\{1\\}$. But then $b,c < a$, and $b\\mid n$, contradicting the assumption that $a$ was the smallest divisor.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about whether the smallest non-1 divisor of a number is always prime. The user on Math Stack Exchange is asking if this hypothesis is true, especially for odd numbers, since they managed to handle even numbers easily by noting that 2 would be the smallest divisor.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem statement here is about natural numbers, so the main objects are n and a. Let's parse through the original question.\n\nThe hypothesis is: For any n in natural numbers (excluding 1?), the smallest number a (also in natural numbers excluding 1) that divides n is prime. Wait, the original question says \"any n ∈ ℕ\", but then later specifies n ∈ ℕ \\ {1}. So I need to check if n is in ℕ including 1 or not. The user mentions \"for any n ∈ ℕ\", but in their proof sketch, they consider n ∈ ℕ \\ {1}. So maybe the assumption is n is a natural number greater than 1. Then, a is in ℕ \\ {1}, so a is at least 2.\n\nSo Assumptions:\n\nn is a natural number,\nn is not equal to 1,\na is a natural number,\na is not equal to 1,\na divides n,\na is the smallest such number.\n\nBut according to the example given, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. The example had:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo here, each line is a separate condition. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\nn is an element of the set of natural numbers (but need to check if n >1? The problem statement says \"for any n ∈ ℕ\", but in the user's explanation, they consider n not 1. So maybe we need to note that n is greater than 1. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest number, $a \\in \\mathbb{N}/\\{1\\}$ such that $a \\vert n$ should be prime.\"\n\nWait, the original hypothesis is for any n in N, but then a is in N without 1. However, n=1 would have no such a, because the divisors of 1 are only 1. So maybe the problem implicitly assumes n ≥ 2. The user also mentions \"for all n ∈ ℕ/{1}\" in their proof sketch. So the correct assumption is n is a natural number greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nn is a natural number,\nn is greater than 1,\na is a natural number,\na is greater than 1,\na divides n,\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption line addresses one property of one object. So \"n is a natural number\" and \"n is greater than 1\" are separate lines. Similarly for a: \"a is a natural number\", \"a is greater than 1\", \"a divides n\", and \"a is the smallest such divisor\". Wait, but the last one is a bit more complex. How to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\". But that combines two properties: a divides n, a >1, and a is the smallest such. But according to the example, each line is a single property. Let's see the example:\n\nIn the example, assumptions were:\n\nn is an integer,\n\nn is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each line is a single condition on one object. So perhaps here, we need to list:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is a natural number,\n\na is greater than 1,\n\na divides n,\n\nFor all natural numbers b, if b divides n and b >1, then a ≤ b.\n\nBut that's more precise, but maybe it's too detailed. Alternatively, \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\". But does that count as a single property? The example had \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a property. So maybe \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" is acceptable as a single line.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut wait, \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" already implies that a divides n and a >1. So maybe that's sufficient. However, to be precise, maybe the user expects each condition broken down. Let's check.\n\nIn the example, the original problem said the number is divisible by 91, and the assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, actually, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem changed the assumption to n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that must have been a mistake. Wait, no. Wait, the original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might have been a mistake in the example, but perhaps the user intended to structure the problem with the necessary assumptions. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different structure. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. But in any case, following the user's example, each assumption is a single condition.\n\nSo returning to the current problem. The problem is: For any natural number n (excluding 1), the smallest divisor a (excluding 1) is prime. So the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- n > 1.\n\n- a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't add any extra conditions beyond that. So according to the example, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut then the problem is to prove that a is prime.\n\nAlternatively, since a is defined as the smallest divisor greater than 1, maybe that's considered a single assumption. However, the example had two assumptions even though the original problem was for \"every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to list each condition separately, even if they are part of the problem's setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's example had a mistake, and the correct assumptions should only list the conditions given in the problem. But regardless, we need to follow the example structure as given. In the example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted problem included it. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem in the example is: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like an error. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps the example was incorrect. But since the user provided that example, we need to follow it, even if there's an inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, in the example, the user rephrased the original problem, which was for all integers n, but then the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe the user intended to extract the implicit assumptions. But that might be a misunderstanding. However, given that, we need to proceed with the current problem.\n\nThe current problem is: For any n ∈ ℕ, the smallest a ∈ ℕ \\ {1} such that a divides n is prime. The user's question is whether this is true, particularly for odd numbers.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n\n- n is a natural number.\n\n- n > 1 (since for n=1, there is no a >1 that divides it).\n\n- a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that a is prime.\n\nSo following the example's structure, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is a natural number,\n\na is greater than 1,\n\na divides n,\n\na is the smallest such divisor.\n\nBut each line is one condition. Then the problem is to prove that a is prime.\n\nAlternatively, combining the last three into \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" as one assumption. Given the example had two assumptions for the problem where originally it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which was incorrect. So perhaps in the example, the user made a mistake, but we have to follow the instruction.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but trying to adhere to the instruction: \"Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumption lines:\n\nn is an element of the set of natural numbers,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is an element of the set of natural numbers,\n\na is greater than 1,\n\na divides n,\n\nfor all natural numbers b, if b divides n and b >1, then a ≤ b.\n\nBut that last one is a bit long, but maybe phrased as \"a is the minimal divisor of n greater than 1.\"\n\nBut perhaps the user prefers each line to be a simple condition. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions are:\n\nn is a natural number greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut each as separate lines:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nBut \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" combines several things. However, according to the example, it's acceptable to have \"n is divisible by 7\" as a single assumption line, which is a condition on n. So similarly, \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" can be a single line.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a is prime.\n\nBut the original question also mentions the user's thoughts on even and odd numbers. However, according to the example, the problem is restructured to focus on the core. The example had the original problem as proving divisibility by 91 for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which might be incorrect. But perhaps the user's example was not accurate. Anyway, following the instructions, we need to filter the unrelated information.\n\nThe original problem is: Is the smallest non-1 divisor of a number always prime? The user's hypothesis is that yes, and they are asking for a proof, especially for odd numbers.\n\nThe core assumptions are n is a natural number >1, a is the smallest divisor >1 of n. The problem is to prove a is prime.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a is prime.\n\nAlternatively, considering the definition of a, maybe \"a is the smallest natural number greater than 1 that divides n\" as an assumption.\n\nBut to split into single conditions:\n\n- n ∈ ℕ\n\n- n > 1\n\n- a ∈ ℕ\n\n- a > 1\n\n- a divides n\n\n- For all b ∈ ℕ, if b >1 and b divides n, then a ≤ b.\n\nBut each of these is a single condition. However, the last one is a universal statement. But according to the example, perhaps it's better to combine some. For instance, the example had \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is a combination of \"7 divides n\". So perhaps here, \"a is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1\" is a single assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nn is a natural number,\n\nn is greater than 1,\n\na is the smallest divisor of n greater than 1.\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that a is prime.\n\nYes, that seems concise and captures the essential assumptions and the problem.",
