    "Content": "I'd like to know how could I prove that $L^p [0,1]$ isn't induced by an inner product? (For $p\\neq 2$, including $p=\\inf$). It is clear to me that I would need to find two functions $f$, $g$ in $L^p$ that would not fulfill the parallelogram-law. I'm having trouble finding these functions (for both finite and infinite cases).\nCould you guide me how to find such functions? what intuition is there for these kind of questions? What would be special about them? Any guidenss would be blessed.\nThank you",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'll give you a hint. Let $$f(x)=\\begin{cases}2,x\\in[0,3/4],\\\\0,x>3/4,\\end{cases}\\quad g(x)=f(1-x).$$ Then the parallelogram law says that in hilbert spaces we have\n$$2\\|f\\|^2+2\\|g\\|^2=\\|f-g\\|^2+\\|f+g\\|^2.$$ Can you calculate the norms above?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the L^p space on [0,1] isn't induced by an inner product when p isn't 2, including p=infinity. They mentioned using the parallelogram law, which makes sense because a norm comes from an inner product if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the parallelogram law: for any two vectors f and g in the space, the equation ||f + g||² + ||f - g||² = 2||f||² + 2||g||² must hold. If we can find just one pair of functions where this fails, then the norm isn't induced by an inner product.\n\nThe challenge here is choosing the right functions f and g for different values of p. Let's start with the case when p is finite and not equal to 2. Maybe simple functions that are non-overlapping or have different characteristics. For example, characteristic functions on intervals might work. Let's say f is 1 on [0,1/2] and 0 elsewhere, and g is 1 on [1/2,1] and 0 elsewhere. Then compute the L^p norms of f + g and f - g. Wait, but f and g are orthogonal in some sense. Hmm, but in L^p, unless p=2, orthogonality isn't captured by the inner product. Let's compute the norms.\n\nFor finite p, let's take f and g as characteristic functions of [0,1/2] and [1/2,1]. Then ||f||_p = (1/2)^{1/p}, same for ||g||_p. Then ||f + g||_p is (1)^{1/p} = 1, since f + g is 1 on [0,1]. Similarly, ||f - g||_p would be the same as ||f + g||_p because the absolute value raised to p would integrate to the same value. Wait, but f - g is 1 on [0,1/2] and -1 on [1/2,1], so |f - g| is 1 everywhere, so the integral is 1, hence norm is 1. Then the left side of the parallelogram law is 1² + 1² = 2. The right side is 2*( (1/2)^{2/p} + (1/2)^{2/p} ) = 2*(2*(1/2)^{2/p}) ) = 4*(1/2)^{2/p}. For this to equal 2, we need 4*(1/2)^{2/p} = 2 => (1/2)^{2/p} = 1/2 => 2/p = 1 => p=2. So for p ≠ 2, this equality doesn't hold. Therefore, these functions f and g would violate the parallelogram law when p ≠ 2. That should work for finite p ≠ 2.\n\nFor p=infinity, we need different functions because the norm is the essential supremum. Let's consider f and g such that their sup norms interact differently. For example, take f(x) = 1 on [0,1/2] and 0 elsewhere, and g(x) = 1 on [1/2,1] and 0 elsewhere. Then ||f||_infty = 1, ||g||_infty =1. Then ||f + g||_infty is 1, since at any point x, either f(x) or g(x) is 1, but not both. Similarly, ||f - g||_infty is 1 because |f(x) - g(x)| is 1 on [0,1]. So left side is 1 + 1 =2. Right side is 2*(1² +1²)=4. Since 2≠4, the parallelogram law fails here as well. So this choice of functions works for p=infinity too.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is to select functions that are non-overlapping (so their sum and difference have norms that can be computed easily) and then check the parallelogram law. The example functions would be characteristic functions of intervals for finite p and p=infty. The intuition is that in L^2, the parallelogram law holds due to the inner product structure, but in other L^p spaces, the geometry is different, leading to a violation of this law. So the special thing about these functions is their disjoint support, which simplifies the calculation of their norms in sum and difference.",
