    "Content": "I'm trying to prove that if we have the elementary symmetric polynomials that the following identity holds:(where $x = (x_1,..,x_n)$ is a vector of n variables)\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^n e_k(x)^2 = x_1\\cdots x_n  \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}  {2j \\choose j} e_{n-2j}(x_1+1/x_1,\\cdots x_n+1/x_n).$$ I'm trying to prove this combinatorially, but I'm stuck so I'd love some hints or tips. Update:\nI guess we can get some interpretation with strictly increasing functions, but that thought isn't fully developed yet.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Consider the following experiment. There are $n$ boxes, with two identical coins each. We pick some $k \\in \\{0,\\ldots,n\\}$, pick $k$ coins from different boxes $A$, and then again pick $k$ coins from different boxes $B$. The left-hand side is exactly the generating function of all possible outcomes. Here is another way of performing the same experiment. First choose a number $j < n/2$; this is going to be the size of $|A \\setminus B| = |B \\setminus A|$. Instead of choosing the elements in $(A \\setminus B) \\cup (B \\setminus A)$, we will choose which elements are in $A \\cap B$ and which in $\\overline{A \\cup B}$; we have to decide on $n-2j$ elements. If we start with assuming that each element is picked once (this is the factor $x_1\\cdots x_n$), then putting an element $i$ in $A \\cap B$ is like multiplying by $x_i$, and putting it in $\\overline{A \\cup B}$ is like multiplying by $1/x_i$. We are left with $2j$ elements, $j$ of which are in $A \\setminus B$ and the rest in $B \\setminus A$. There are $\\binom{2j}{j}$ choices for that. Writing everything out, we get the right-hand side.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to format this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The original problem is about proving a combinatorial identity involving elementary symmetric polynomials. The user provided an example where they extracted assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example included assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the given problem here, the user hasn't mentioned any explicit assumptions except those inherent in the problem statement. The question defines the elementary symmetric polynomials and states the identity involving a vector x of n variables. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: the identity is for a vector x = (x1, ..., xn), and the sum involves e_k(x)^2. The right side includes x1...xn times a sum over j with binomial coefficients and e_{n-2j} evaluated at x_i + 1/x_i. The user is trying to prove this combinatorially.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are probably about the variables and the polynomials. Since elementary symmetric polynomials are defined for any number of variables, the assumptions would relate to the structure given. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nPossible assumptions:\n1. x is a vector of n variables, i.e., x = (x1, x2, ..., xn).\n2. e_k(x) denotes the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in the variables x1, ..., xn.\n3. The sum on the left is from k=0 to n.\n4. On the right, the sum is over j from 0 to floor(n/2).\n5. The binomial coefficient {2j choose j} is part of the right-hand side.\n6. The term e_{n-2j} is evaluated at (x1 + 1/x1, ..., xn + 1/xn).\n\nWait, but assumptions are supposed to be conditions or properties given in the problem. The problem defines these elements, so they might not be assumptions but part of the problem setup. However, in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, even though it's part of the problem's premise. So here, similarly, we need to list each element that's a given condition.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumptions:\n- x is a vector of n variables, denoted as x = (x1, x2, ..., xn).\n- e_k(x) is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in variables x1, ..., xn.\n- The identity involves a sum from k=0 to n of [e_k(x)]².\n- The right-hand side includes the product x1x2⋯xn multiplied by a sum over j from 0 to floor(n/2) of binomial coefficients (2j choose j) times e_{n−2j}(x1 + 1/x1, ..., xn + 1/xn).\n\nBut each assumption should be a single line, addressing one property. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a vector of n variables, i.e., x = (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ),\neₖ(x) denotes the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in variables x₁, …, xₙ,\nThe left-hand side is the sum from k=0 to n of [eₖ(x)]²,\nThe right-hand side is x₁x₂⋯xₙ multiplied by a sum over j from 0 to ⎣n/2⎦,\nEach term in the sum on the right-hand side is (2j choose j) multiplied by e_{n−2j}(x₁ + 1/x₁, …, xₙ + 1/xₙ).\n\nBut the problem statement as given is to prove that the sum of squares of e_k(x) equals that expression. So the problem is to show that equality holds under the given setup. The original problem doesn't state any additional conditions on x_i, like they are non-zero (since they have 1/x_i), so maybe that's an assumption. Wait, in the right-hand side, they have terms x_i + 1/x_i, so each x_i must be non-zero to avoid division by zero. So that's an important assumption.\n\nSo, the variables x_i must be non-zero. That's an implicit assumption here. Therefore, the assumptions should include that each x_i is non-zero.\n\nSo revised assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nx is a vector of n variables, i.e., x = (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ),\nEach x_i is a non-zero element,\neₖ(x) denotes the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in variables x₁, …, xₙ,\nThe problem involves proving an identity between sums of squared elementary symmetric polynomials and a product involving binomial coefficients and elementary symmetric polynomials evaluated at x_i + 1/x_i.\n\nWait, but the problem is exactly the identity given. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- x is a vector of n variables (x₁, ..., xₙ).\n- Each x_i ≠ 0.\n- eₖ(x) is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly mention that x_i are non-zero, but the presence of 1/x_i implies that. So that's an implicit assumption. Therefore, it's necessary to list that each x_i is non-zero as an assumption.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nx = (x₁, x₂, …, xₙ) is a vector of n variables,\nEach x_i is non-zero,\neₖ(x) denotes the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in x₁, …, xₙ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^n e_k(x)^2 = x_1\\cdots x_n  \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}  \\binom{2j}{j} e_{n-2j}(x_1+1/x_1,\\cdots, x_n+1/x_n).$$\n\nI think that's the correct breakdown. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition. The problem is the identity to be proven.",
