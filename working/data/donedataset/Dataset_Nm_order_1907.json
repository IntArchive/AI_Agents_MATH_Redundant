    "AcceptedAnswer": "I'm going to sketch a way to transform the integral into a sum.  The sum looks difficult, but it converges and numerically checks with the stated result. Begin by substituting $u=\\log{\\tan{x}}$.  Then $$du = \\frac{1}{\\tan{x}} \\sec^2{x} \\, dx = \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\tan{x}} + \\tan{x} \\right ) dx = (e^{-u} + e^u) \\, dx $$ and $$\\begin{align} \\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2} dx \\: \\ln (\\ln(\\tan x)) &= \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\: \\frac{\\log{u}}{e^u + e^{-u}} \\\\ &= \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\: \\frac{e^{-u} \\log{u}}{1+e^{-2 u}} \\\\ &= \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\: e^{-u} \\log{u} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k e^{-2 k u} \\end{align}$$ Reverse the order of sum and integral, which is justified by Fubini's Theorem (both sum and integral are absolutely convergent).  Then we may write $$\\begin{align} \\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2} dx \\: \\ln (\\ln(\\tan x)) &= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\:  e^{-(2 k+1) u} \\log{u} \\\\ &= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{2 k+1} \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\:  e^{-u} \\log{u} - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\frac{\\log{(2 k+1)}}{2 k+1} \\int_0^{\\infty} du \\:  e^{-u}  \\\\ &= -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\gamma + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \\frac{\\log{(2 k+1)}}{2 k+1} \\\\ \\end{align} $$ where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.  The sum on the right-hand sign is known : $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \\frac{\\log{(2 k+1)}}{2 k+1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\gamma + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\log{\\frac{\\Gamma{\\left ( \\frac{3}{4} \\right )}^4}{\\pi}} $$ Use the fact that $$\\Gamma{\\left ( \\frac{3}{4} \\right )} \\Gamma{\\left ( \\frac{1}{4} \\right )} = \\sqrt{2} \\pi$$ to deduce that $$ \\int_{\\pi/4}^{\\pi/2} dx \\: \\ln (\\ln(\\tan x)) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\log{\\left [\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma{\\left ( \\frac{3}{4} \\right )}}{\\Gamma{\\left ( \\frac{1}{4} \\right )}}\\right ]} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The original problem is about evaluating Vardi's integral using differentiation under the integral sign.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the problem. The integral is from π/4 to π/2 of ln(ln(tan x)) dx. The user mentioned that it's evaluated using differentiation under the integral sign. However, the original problem statement doesn't list explicit assumptions like in the example. The example had an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, but here, the problem is more about the method to use.\n\nWait, maybe the assumptions here are about the domain of integration and the function's properties. For example, the integral is over [π/4, π/2], and ln(ln(tan x)) must be defined there. So, tan x must be positive, which it is in that interval. Also, ln(tan x) must be positive, so tan x > 1. Since tan(π/4) = 1 and tan x increases to infinity as x approaches π/2, the integrand is defined for x in (π/4, π/2), but at x=π/4, ln(tan x) = ln(1) = 0, so ln(0) is undefined. Wait, but the lower limit is π/4, which makes ln(ln(tan x)) problematic because ln(tan(π/4)) = ln(1) = 0, and ln(0) is undefined. So perhaps the integral is an improper integral at the lower limit. That's an important point. However, the problem statement might assume convergence, or that the integral exists. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [π/4, π/2].\n- The integrand ln(ln(tan x)) is considered as an improper integral at x = π/4.\n- The function ln(ln(tan x)) is integrable over [π/4, π/2].\n\nBut the original example's assumptions were more about the conditions on variables (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the key assumptions relate to the method (differentiation under the integral sign) and the convergence of the integral. Alternatively, maybe there are substitutions or variable changes used. But the problem as stated doesn't provide explicit assumptions beyond the integral's limits and the integrand. The user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem. Since the example's assumptions were conditions on n, here maybe the assumptions are about the integral's bounds and the function's properties necessary for applying differentiation under the integral sign. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention any parameters, so differentiation under the integral sign might require introducing a parameter. Wait, the original problem says \"I would like to see a method which uses differentiation under the integral sign.\" So perhaps the assumption is that such a method is applicable here, but how to phrase that as an assumption? Maybe the integral can be expressed in terms of a parameterized integral, allowing differentiation with respect to that parameter. But the user's example had assumptions about the variables in the problem. Here, maybe the key is to note that the integral converges, or that certain substitutions are valid. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that differentiation under the integral sign is permissible here, i.e., the integrand and its derivative with respect to a parameter are continuous. But since the original integral doesn't have a parameter, introducing one might be part of the method. Hmm. This is tricky. The original problem statement doesn't list explicit assumptions beyond the integral itself. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is the domain of integration. But according to the example, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. Let me check the example again: the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so n being an integer is given. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions include \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that example might be incorrect. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the user provided a different example where they added an assumption. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect. Wait, in the original problem, the user wrote: \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", not necessarily divisible by 7. So that seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in their example. But regardless, following their format, in this current problem, the assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. The integral is from π/4 to π/2 of ln(ln(tan x)) dx. The problem is to prove that this integral equals the given expression involving pi and Gamma functions. The user wants to use differentiation under the integral sign. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is over the interval [π/4, π/2].\n- The integrand ln(ln(tan x)) is treated as an improper integral at x = π/4.\n- The function ln(ln(tan x)) is integrable over [π/4, π/2].\n- The method of differentiation under the integral sign is applicable.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variable in the problem (n being integer and divisible by 7). Here, perhaps the main assumption is about the convergence of the integral and the applicability of differentiation under the integral sign. However, the problem statement doesn't mention parameters, so introducing a parameter might be part of the solution method. Therefore, the problem might involve introducing a parameter into the integral to apply differentiation. But since the problem as stated doesn't have a parameter, maybe the assumption is that such a parameter can be introduced. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution t = tan x is used, transforming the integral into a different variable, but that's part of the solution method, not an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, considering the example's structure, maybe in this case, the only assumption is the interval of integration. But according to the example, each assumption is a single condition on one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from π/4 to π/2,\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)),\nThe integral is evaluated using differentiation under the integral sign.\n\nBut the third point is about the method, not an assumption. The problem asks to prove the integral equals a certain expression using differentiation under the integral sign. So perhaps the assumption is that the method is applicable here. However, the example's assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the method. \n\nGiven the example might have had an error, but following the user's instruction to structure the problem as in the example, perhaps here the assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's form. But the original problem's example included an incorrect assumption (adding n divisible by 7 when the original problem didn't state that), which might suggest that the user wants to list all given conditions as assumptions. But in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which seems incorrect. Maybe the user made a mistake there. \n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions are simply:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [π/4, π/2],\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals (π/2) ln[(√(2π) Γ(3/4)) / Γ(1/4)].\n\nBut the original example included assumptions that weren't in the problem (like n divisible by 7), so maybe the user wants to list implicit assumptions. For instance, in the integral's case, maybe the assumption is that the integral converges, or that the substitution is valid. But without more info, perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's bounds and the integrand. However, the example's assumptions included conditions on variables, so here, since there are no variables, just the integral, perhaps the only assumption is the interval and the integrand. \n\nAlternatively, considering the answer might require changing variables or introducing parameters, but that's part of the solution. Given the user's example, which had two assumptions (n integer and n divisible by 7), even though the original problem didn't state the latter, perhaps here the assistant is supposed to list the conditions given in the problem. The original problem states the integral from π/4 to π/2 of ln(ln(tan x)) dx, so the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from π/4 to π/2,\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)).\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals the given expression with Gamma functions.\n\nBut maybe also including that the integral is improper at π/4 since ln(ln(tan π/4)) = ln(ln(1)) = ln(0), which is undefined. So that's an important point, hence the integral is an improper integral. Therefore, the assumption should include that. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated as an improper integral from π/4 to π/2,\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)) for x in (π/4, π/2].\n\nBut perhaps breaking it down into separate assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is π/4,\nThe upper limit of integration is π/2,\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)),\nThe integral is treated as an improper integral at π/4.\n\nEach of these as separate lines. But according to the example, each assumption is a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [π/4, π/2],\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)),\nThe integral is improper at the lower limit π/4.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the integral equals the given expression.\n\nBut I need to check the original problem statement. The user provided:\n\nTitle: Vardi's Integral: ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ln(ln(tan x)) dx\n\nQuestion: Prove that: ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ln(ln(tan x)) dx = (π/2) ln[ sqrt(2π) Γ(3/4) / Γ(1/4) ]\n\nThey mention knowing it can be evaluated via derivatives of Hurwitz Zeta but want a method using differentiation under integral sign.\n\nSo the assumptions would include the integral's limits and the integrand. The integral being improper at π/4 is implicit because ln(ln(tan x)) is undefined there. But perhaps the problem assumes convergence, so maybe include that the integral converges.\n\nBut the example didn't include convergence assumptions. The example's original problem didn't state n divisible by 7 but the formatted problem added it. That suggests maybe the assistant should extract implicit conditions. In the example, proving divisibility by 91 (which is 7*13) might require n to be such that 5^n... expression is divisible by both 7 and 13. If n is divisible by 6, maybe? But the example added n divisible by 7, which might be incorrect. Anyway, following that approach, perhaps here the assistant should list the integral's limits, the integrand, and that it's an improper integral.\n\nSo final assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval [π/4, π/2],\nThe integrand is ln(ln(tan x)),\nThe integral is improper at x = π/4,\nThe integral converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ln(ln(tan x)) dx equals (π/2) ln[ sqrt(2π) Γ(3/4) / Γ(1/4) ].\n\nBut in the example, the problem line included the expression to prove. So I'll structure it accordingly.",
