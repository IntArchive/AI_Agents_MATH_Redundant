    "Content": "I am working through Ted Shifrin's book Multivariable Mathematics. There is an exercise problem that is meant to demonstrate that one can have $\\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$ but $ f(x,y) \\neq  g(x) + h(y)$ . The question (3.6.11) is as follows: $$ \\mathrm{Given} \\; f(x, y) = \\begin{cases} 0, \\; x < 0\\; \\mathrm{or} \\; y < 0 \\\\x^3, \\; x \\geq 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; y > 0 \\end{cases} $$ Show that $f$ is $C^2$ Show that $\\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$ Show that $f(x,y)$ cannot be written as $g(x) + h(y)$ for appropriate functions $g, h$ . I see that the domain is the entire plane except the x-axis, that is $\\mathbb{R}^2 -\\{y=0\\}$ .\nThe function is then 0 in all quadrants except the first, where it is $x^3$ . I could show 1. and 2. above, but I am puzzled by two things. Q1 What's wrong with writing $f(x,y) = g(x) + h(y)$ piecewise in each quadrant ? Q2. Will anything change if the domain allows the line $y=0$ also ? Q3. What is the takeaway from this problem ? I do not  understand that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For Q1; defining the quadrants requires both $x$ and $y$ . For example, defining $$g(x):=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n0   &\\text{ if } x<0\\  \\text{ or } \\; y < 0, \\\\\nx^3 &\\text{ if } x\\geq0 \\; \\text{ and } \\; y > 0.\n\\end{array}\\right.,$$ does not make sense as now $g(x)$ depends on $y$ . More formally; if $f(x,y)=g(x)+h(y)$ then for all $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\\in\\Bbb{R}^2$ we have $$f(x_1,y_1)+f(x_2,y_2)-f(x_1,y_2)-f(x_2,y_2)=0.$$ But this is clearly not the case, take for example $x_1=y_1=1$ and $x_2=y_2=-1$ . For Q2; the given function $f(x,y)$ does not extend to a function differentiable on $\\Bbb{R}^2$ . There are no functions with this property that are differentiable on all of $\\Bbb{R}^2$ . See also this excellent answer . For Q3; the takeaway is that the implication $$\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial x\\partial y}=0\n\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad\nf(x,y)=g(x)+h(y),$$ depends crucially on the domain; it holds if the domain is $\\Bbb{R}^2$ , but not if the domain is, for example, a disconnected subset of $\\Bbb{R}^2$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to break down this problem and format it according to the user's requirements. The original question is from a Math Stack Exchange post about a problem in multivariable calculus. The user wants me to structure the problem by listing the assumptions and the problem statement clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the necessary information and filter out any unrelated parts. The main problem involves a function f(x, y) defined piecewise, and there are three parts to the problem: showing f is C², showing the mixed partial derivative is zero, and showing that f can't be expressed as g(x) + h(y). Then there are some additional questions from the original poster, but since the task is to structure the problem, not answer the questions, I can ignore the Q1, Q2, Q3 parts.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions are listed as individual conditions applied to one object each. For the given problem, the function f is defined piecewise with specific cases. So the assumptions should include the definition of f(x, y) in different regions, the domain of f, and any conditions on differentiability (since part of the problem is to show f is C²). The original problem mentions that the domain is ℝ² minus {y=0}, but the function is defined for x < 0 or y < 0, and x ≥ 0 and y > 0. Wait, actually, the user wrote that the domain is the entire plane except the x-axis, which is ℝ² - {y=0}, but the function is 0 in all quadrants except the first where it's x³. So the domain is actually split into regions based on the signs of x and y, but with y=0 excluded. However, the function is defined for all points except where y=0. Wait, the problem statement says: \"the entire plane except the x-axis\", so y=0 is excluded. The function is 0 when x < 0 or y < 0, and x³ when x ≥ 0 and y > 0. So the domain is ℝ² \\ {y=0}.\n\nBut in the problem, part of the exercise is to show f is C². So the assumptions should include the piecewise definition of f, the domain being ℝ² \\ {y=0}, and perhaps that f is defined as 0 in certain regions and x³ in another. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So let's list them.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The function f(x, y) is defined piecewise as 0 when x < 0 or y < 0.\n- The function f(x, y) is defined as x³ when x ≥ 0 and y > 0.\n- The domain of f is ℝ² \\ {y = 0}.\n- f is a C² function (but wait, part of the problem is to show that f is C², so maybe that's not an assumption? Wait, the problem says \"Show that f is C²\", so that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the assumptions are the definition of f and the domain. The original problem says \"given f(x,y) = ...\", so the assumptions are the definition of f and its domain.\n\nSo the assumptions should be:\n\n- f(x, y) = 0 when x < 0 or y < 0.\n- f(x, y) = x³ when x ≥ 0 and y > 0.\n- The domain of f is ℝ² \\ {y = 0}.\n\nBut wait, the domain is given as ℝ² minus the x-axis (y=0), so that's an important condition. The function is not defined on y=0. So the third assumption is that.\n\nThen the problem parts are to show three things:\n\n1. Show that f is C².\n2. Show that ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0.\n3. Show that f cannot be written as g(x) + h(y).\n\nSo the problem statement should include those three tasks.\n\nBut the original problem mentions \"Show that f is C²\" first. So putting this together.\n\nNow, checking the example again. The example had assumptions like n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property.\n\nIn our case, the function f is defined in two cases, and the domain is excluded y=0. So each part of the function's definition and the domain are separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x, y) = 0 when x < 0 or y < 0,\nf(x, y) = x³ when x ≥ 0 and y > 0,\nthe domain of f is ℝ² \\ {y = 0}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that:\n1. f is C²,\n2. ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0,\n3. f(x, y) cannot be written as g(x) + h(y) for appropriate functions g, h.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's third part says \"Show that f(x,y) cannot be written as g(x) + h(y) for appropriate functions g, h.\" So that's the third part.\n\nThe user might have included extra questions in the original post (Q1, Q2, Q3), but according to the task, we need to filter out unrelated information. The problem itself is the three parts given in the exercise. The user's own questions (Q1-Q3) are part of their thought process but not part of the problem statement. So they should be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the three assumptions as the definition of f and its domain, and the problem as the three tasks.\n\nLet me check again the original problem statement:\n\n\"Given f(x, y) = ... Show that f is C^2. Show that ∂²f/∂x∂y = 0. Show that f(x,y) cannot be written as g(x) + h(y).\"\n\nSo the original problem's three parts are the problem. The assumptions are the definition of f and the domain. The domain is ℝ² - {y=0}, as the user clarified.\n\nSo yes, the formatted problem should be as above.",
