    "Content": "I'm looking for a simple proof that up to isomorphism every group of order $2p$ ( $p$ prime greater than two) is either $\\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ or $D_{p}$ (the Dihedral group of order $2p$ ). I should note that by simple I mean short and elegant and not necessarily elementary. So feel free to use tools like Sylow Theorems, Cauchy Theorem and similar stuff. Thanks a lot!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since we are allowed to use Sylow, we can assume $G$ is generated by $x,y$ with $x^p=y^2=1$, where $\\langle x \\rangle \\lhd G$, so $y^{-1}xy = x^t$ for some $t$ with $1 \\le t \\le p-1$. Then $x = y^{-2}xy^2 = x^{t^2}$, so $p$ divides $t^2-1 = (t-1)(t+1)$, hence $p$ divides $t-1$ or $t+1$ and the only possibilities are $t=1$ or $p-1$, giving the cyclic and dihedral groups.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a structured format where they list the assumptions and then the problem. The original question is about proving that every group of order 2p (with p prime >2) is isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z_{2p} or the dihedral group D_p. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem states that p is a prime greater than two, and we're dealing with groups of order 2p. So the assumptions should include that p is prime, p > 2, the group has order 2p, and we need to consider isomorphisms. The problem is to show that up to isomorphism, the only groups are Z_{2p} and D_p.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions would be similar. Each assumption is one property applied to one object. So breaking down the problem:\n\n- The prime number p is considered.\n- The prime p is greater than 2.\n- The group in question has order 2p.\n- The classification is up to isomorphism.\n\nSo each of these points is a separate assumption. Then the problem is to prove that the only groups are Z_{2p} and D_p. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original question mentions using Sylow theorems, Cauchy, etc., but those are tools for the proof, not assumptions of the problem itself. The problem's assumptions are the given conditions on p and the group's order. \n\nSo the formatted problem should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one condition. Then the problem statement follows. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, similar structure. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- p is a prime number.\n- p is greater than 2.\n- G is a group of order 2p.\n- Isomorphism is considered up to group isomorphism.\n\nProblem: Prove that every group of order 2p is isomorphic to either the cyclic group ℤ_{2p} or the dihedral group D_p.\n\nWait, but in the original question, the title mentions \"up to isomorphism\", so maybe that's part of the problem statement. Let me make sure each assumption is a single property. The first assumption is p is prime. Second, p > 2. Third, group order is 2p. The \"up to isomorphism\" is part of the problem statement, not an assumption on the group's properties. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\np is a prime number,\np is greater than 2,\nG is a group of order 2p.\n\nProblem: Prove that up to isomorphism, every group of order 2p is either ℤ_{2p} or D_p.\n\nThat seems right. The \"up to isomorphism\" is part of what's being proven (classifying the groups), not an assumption. The group G is of order 2p, which is an assumption. The prime p >2 is given. So this should be correct.",
