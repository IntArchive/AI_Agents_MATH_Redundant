    "AcceptedAnswer": "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients and the gcd of these coefficients is $1$, by Gauss's lemma it suffices to show that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\\mathbf{Z}[x]$.  Suppose that $f(x)=g(x)h(x)$ where $g,h\\in\\mathbf{Z}[x]$ are nonconstant.  For $1\\le c\\le 2013$, we have $2014=f(c)=g(c)\\cdot h(c)$, so both $g(c)$ and $h(c)$ are (positive or negative) divisors of $2014$.  Since $2014=2\\cdot 19\\cdot 53$, we see that $2014$ is divisible by exactly $16$ integers, namely $\\pm 2^i 19^j 53^k$ with $i,j,k\\in\\{0,1\\}$.  Thus there must be some divisor $d$ of $2014$ which occurs as $g(c)$ for at least $\\lceil 2014/16\\rceil=126$ values $c\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2013\\}$. I claim that $g(x)-d$ is divisible by $(x-1)(x-2)\\dots (x-2013)$ in $\\mathbf{Z}[x]$.  To show this, let $S$ \n be the set of all $c\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2013\\}$ for which $g(c)=d$.  Since $p(x):=\\prod_{s\\in S} (x-s)$ is monic, we can write $g(x)-d=p(x)q(x)+r(x)$ with $q,r\\in\\mathbf{Z}[x]$ and $\\deg(r)<\\deg(p)$.  But every element of $S$ is a root of both $p(x)$ and $g(x)-d$, and hence is a root of $r(x)$, so the number of roots of $r(x)$ is at least $\\#S=\\deg(p)$, and hence is bigger than $\\deg(r)$, so we must have $r(x)=0$.  Now suppose that $S\\ne\\{1,2,\\dots,2013\\}$, and let $c$ be an integer with $1\\le c\\le 2013$ and $c\\notin S$. Since $g(c)-d=p(c)q(c)$ where $d$ and $g(c)$ are distinct divisors of $2014$ (and where $p(c)$ and $q(c)$ are integers), it follows that $\\lvert p(c)\\rvert\\le 4018$.  But $p(c)=\\prod_{s\\in S}(c-s)$ is the product of at least $126$ distinct nonzero integers, hence has absolute value at least $(63!)^2$, which is bigger than $4018$, a contradiction.  Therefore $S=\\{1,2,\\dots,2013\\}$, so that $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\dots(x-2013)$ and $q(x)\\in\\mathbf{Z}[x]$ satisfy $g(x)-d=p(x)q(x)$. The same argument shows that there is a divisor $D$ of $2014$ for which $h(x)-D=p(x)Q(x)$ with $Q(x)\\in\\mathbf{Z}[x]$ and $p(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\\dots (x-2013)$ as above.  In particular, since we assumed that both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are nonconstant, it follows that both of them have degree at least $2013$.  But their product has degree $4026$, so we must have $\\deg(g)=\\deg(h)=2013$, whence both $q(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are nonzero constants (which we will call $q$ and $Q$).  Hence we have\n$$\np(x)^2 + 2014 = f(x) = g(x)\\cdot h(x) = (d+p(x)\\cdot q)\\cdot (D+p(x)\\cdot Q).\n$$\nIt follows that $y^2+2014=(d+yq)(D+yQ)$ (since this is an equality of degree-$2$ polynomials which is valid for more than two values $y$, namely for any value $y=p(x)$).  But this is impossible, since $\\sqrt{-2014}$ is irrational.  This contradiction shows that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\\mathbf{Z}[x]$, and hence (by Gauss's lemma) in $\\mathbf{Q}[x]$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me read through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about proving or disproving whether the polynomial f(x) = (x-1)^2(x-2)^2...(x-2013)^2 + 2014 is reducible over the rational numbers Q. The user also mentions a similar problem where g(x) = (x-1)(x-2)...(x-n) + 1 is reducible except when n=4. They provided an example for n=4 where the polynomial becomes a square, making it reducible.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The original problem defines f(x) as the product of squared linear terms from (x-1) to (x-2013), all squared, then adds 2014. The task is to determine reducibility over Q.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user, they listed assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, I need to identify similar assumptions.\n\nBut wait, in the given problem, the polynomial is constructed with specific terms: each (x-k)^2 for k from 1 to 2013, then adding 2014. Are there any explicit assumptions here? The problem states that f(x) is defined as such, so perhaps the main assumption is about the structure of f(x). However, the example given by the user included assumptions on variables (like n being integer). In this case, the problem is about a specific polynomial with 2013 terms, so maybe the key assumption is the form of f(x). The problem is to prove or disprove reducibility over Q.\n\nThe original question mentions that the problem is from an exam and that the constant is 2014. The user tried to relate it to a similar problem where adding 1 instead of 2014 leads to reducibility except in n=4. So perhaps the key here is that 2014 is a specific constant, and the structure of the polynomial is a product of squares plus a constant.\n\nBut for the assumptions section, I need to list each assumption line by line. The problem defines f(x) as the product of squared linear terms from 1 to 2013, then adding 2014. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x) is defined as (x-1)^2(x-2)^2...(x-2013)^2 + 2014\n- The field is the rational numbers Q\n\nWait, the problem says \"Prove or disprove: f(x) is reducible on the field of rational numbers Q\". So the assumptions are the definition of f(x) and the field being Q. But in the example provided, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, there's no variable like n; instead, the polynomial is fixed with 2013 terms. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- f(x) = [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2013)]^2 + 2014\n- The polynomial is considered over the field of rational numbers Q\n\nBut the original problem uses (x-1)^2(x-2)^2...(x-2013)^2, which is the same as [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2013)]^2. So the first assumption is the structure of f(x). The second assumption is the field being Q.\n\nSo formatted:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is equal to (x-1)^2(x-2)^2⋯(x-2013)^2 + 2014,\nThe problem considers reducibility over the field of rational numbers Q.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f(x) is reducible over Q.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each line is one condition on one object. Here, the first line is the definition of f(x), and the second line is the field. So that's two separate assumptions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each assumption is a single condition on one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) is defined as the product of (x−k)^2 for k from 1 to 2013, plus 2014,\nThe problem is considered over the field of rational numbers ℚ.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f(x) is reducible over ℚ.\n\nAlternatively, written more formally:\n\nAssumption:\nf(x) = (x−1)^2(x−2)^2⋯(x−2013)^2 + 2014,\nThe field under consideration is the rational numbers ℚ.\n\nProblem: Prove or disprove that f(x) is reducible over ℚ.\n\nThat should be the correct structure. The key points are the definition of f(x) and the field. There's no mention of any other conditions, like specific values or divisibility, except the structure of the polynomial and the field.",
