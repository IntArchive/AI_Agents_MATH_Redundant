    "Content": "In this question, user Franklin Pezzuti Dyer gives the following surprising integral evaluation: $$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\ln \\lvert\\sin(mx)\\rvert \\cdot \\ln \\lvert\\sin(nx)\\rvert \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi^3}{24} \\frac{\\gcd^2(m,n)}{mn}+\\frac{\\pi\\ln^2(2)}{2}$$ I've verified this numerically for small values for $m,n$ .  Is there a proof?  Also, can we generalize it to more factors in the integrand?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Okay, I'll prove it for you. Start with the following well-known identity: $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\cos(mx)\\cos(nx)dx=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\delta_{mn}\\tag{1}$$ ...where $m,n$ are positive integers. Recall also the well-known Fourier Series $$\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\cos(kx)}{k}=-\\frac{\\ln(2-2\\cos(x))}{2}\\tag{2}$$ Now, replace $m$ in $(1)$ with $mk$ , where both $m,k$ are integers, and divide both sides by $k$ to get $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\frac{\\cos(kmx)}{k}\\cos(nx)dx=\\frac{\\pi\\delta_{(mk)n}}{2k}$$ Then sum both sides from $k=1$ to $\\infty$ to get $$-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln(2-2\\cos(mx))\\cos(nx)dx=\\frac{\\pi m}{2n}[m|n]$$ where the brackets on the $RHS$ are Iverson Brackets . A bit more manipulation yields the equality $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln\\bigg(\\frac{1-\\cos(mx)}{2}\\bigg)\\cos(nx)dx=-\\frac{\\pi m}{n}[m|n]$$ Now, this time, replace $n$ with $nk$ and divide both sides by $k$ . This yields $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln\\bigg(\\frac{1-\\cos(mx)}{2}\\bigg)\\frac{\\cos(knx)}{k}dx=-\\frac{\\pi m}{k^2n}[m|kn]$$ Then sum from $k=1$ to $\\infty$ to get $$-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln\\bigg(\\frac{1-\\cos(mx)}{2}\\bigg)\\ln(2-2\\cos(nx))dx=-\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\pi m}{k^2n}[m|kn]$$ Now notice the following about the series on the RHS. Due to the Iverson Bracket, the kth term is zero unless $m|kn$ , or unless $k$ is divisible by $m/\\gcd(m,n)$ . Thus, we let $k=jm/\\gcd(m,n)$ for the integers $j=1$ to $\\infty$ and reindex the sum: $$\\begin{align}\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln\\bigg(\\frac{1-\\cos(mx)}{2}\\bigg)\\ln(2-2\\cos(nx))dx\n&=-\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\pi m}{(jm/\\gcd(m,n))^2n}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\pi\\gcd^2(m,n)}{mn}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j^2}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{\\pi^3\\gcd^2(m,n)}{6mn}\\\\\n\\end{align}$$ or $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln\\bigg(\\frac{1-\\cos(mx)}{2}\\bigg)\\ln(2-2\\cos(nx))dx=\\frac{\\pi^3\\gcd^2(m,n)}{3mn}\\tag{3}$$ Then, by using the result $$\\int_0^{\\pi}\\ln(1-\\cos(ax))=-\\pi\\ln(2)\\tag{4}$$ for all positive integers $a$ , and the trigonometric identity $$\\sin^2(x/2)=\\frac{1-\\cos(x)}{2}\\tag{5}$$ and finally, a substitution $x\\to 2x$ , the result easily follows from $(3)$ : $$\\bbox[lightgray,5px]{\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\ln \\lvert\\sin(mx)\\rvert \\cdot \\ln \\lvert\\sin(nx)\\rvert \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi^3}{24} \\frac{\\gcd^2(m,n)}{mn}+\\frac{\\pi\\ln^2(2)}{2}}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving an integral identity involving logarithms of sine functions with different arguments. The user also asks if there's a generalization with more factors.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions an integral from 0 to π/2 of the product of two natural logarithms of the absolute value of sine functions with arguments mx and nx. The result is given in terms of gcd squared of m and n divided by mn, plus another term. \n\nSo, the assumptions should include the limits of integration, the integrand being the product of two logarithms of sine functions multiplied together, and the conditions on m and n. Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state restrictions on m and n, but since they're inside sine functions and part of gcd, they're likely positive integers. However, the original question doesn't specify, but the user mentions verifying for small values of m and n, implying they are integers. So, I should note that m and n are integers. Also, the integral is definite from 0 to π/2. The integrand is the product of ln|sin(mx)| and ln|sin(nx)|. The problem wants to prove the equality of this integral to the given expression involving gcd squared. \n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n- The integral is from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is ln|sin(mx)| multiplied by ln|sin(nx)|.\n- m and n are integers.\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly say m and n are integers, but the user mentions gcd(m,n), which is defined for integers. So that implies m and n must be integers. So that's an assumption. Also, the integral involves mx and nx as arguments of sine, so m and n are integers, possibly positive. The problem doesn't specify positive, but gcd is generally for non-negative integers, and sine's periodicity might handle negatives. But to be safe, maybe m and n are positive integers. However, the original problem didn't state that explicitly. Hmm. But in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". So maybe here, even if the problem doesn't state it, the presence of gcd(m,n) requires m and n to be positive integers. So I'll list m and n as integers. Maybe the problem assumes they are positive, but since gcd can handle any integers, but in the context of the integral, m and n could be positive to have the sine arguments make sense over the interval. So I'll list m and n as integers, perhaps positive. Wait, the original problem uses absolute value inside the logarithm, so maybe m and n can be any non-zero integers, but since the integral is from 0 to π/2, mx and nx would be in the interval [0, (π/2)|m|]. But the problem uses gcd, which is typically defined for positive integers, so perhaps m and n are positive integers. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe just integers. Wait, but gcd of negative numbers is the same as their absolute values. So maybe m and n are non-zero integers. But the problem mentions \"small values for m,n\", which are likely positive. So perhaps the assumption is m and n are positive integers. However, the problem statement as given by the user doesn't explicitly state that. But since the integral uses absolute value of sine, it's okay if m or n are negative. But the gcd would still be positive. So maybe the problem assumes m and n are positive integers. Therefore, the assumptions should include that m and n are positive integers. But the original problem didn't state that; the user just mentioned verifying for small values. So perhaps the key assumptions are the integral bounds, the integrand, and that m and n are integers. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, but the formatted assumption included it. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems wrong. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds an extra condition that n is divisible by 7. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but I have to follow the user's instructions. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the current problem. So perhaps I should proceed. The problem here is to structure the integral problem. The key assumptions are: the integral is from 0 to π/2, the integrand is ln|sin(mx)| * ln|sin(nx)|, m and n are integers (since gcd is involved), and possibly that m and n are positive integers. However, the problem statement does not specify that m and n are positive, so perhaps the assumption is just that m and n are integers. Also, the integral uses absolute values, so maybe m and n can be any non-zero integers. But the problem mentions gcd(m,n), which is defined for integers. So the key assumptions here are: m and n are integers, the integral is from 0 to π/2, the integrand is the product of the two log absolute sine functions. The problem is to prove the given identity. Also, the user asks if it can be generalized to more factors. But according to the format, the \"Problem\" part should state the original problem, which is to prove the integral equals that expression. The additional question about generalization might be a separate problem, but the user's example only includes the main problem. So perhaps the formatted problem includes the main integral identity to prove, and the additional question is part of the original problem but maybe filtered out. Wait, the user's instruction says \"filter the unrelated information\". In the example, the original problem had a number A(n), and the formatted problem included the divisibility by 91. The example's formatted problem didn't include the \"for every integer n\" but listed assumptions. Wait, maybe the example's assumption included \"n is an integer\" as a separate line, and \"n is divisible by 7\" as another. But in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 wasn't stated. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I need to follow the format. So, in this current problem, the assumptions should list each condition. The integral is definite from 0 to π/2. The integrand is ln|sin(mx)| multiplied by ln|sin(nx)|. m and n are integers. The problem is to prove that this integral equals the given expression. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2,\nThe integrand is ln|sin(mx)| multiplied by ln|sin(nx)|,\nm and n are integers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\ln \\lvert\\sin(mx)\\rvert \\cdot \\ln \\lvert\\sin(nx)\\rvert \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi^3}{24} \\frac{\\gcd^2(m,n)}{mn}+\\frac{\\pi\\ln^2(2)}{2}.$$\n\nAdditionally, the original question also asks about generalization to more factors, but according to the user's example, maybe we should exclude that part as it's a secondary question. The user's example only included the main problem, so perhaps the formatted problem here should only include the main integral identity to prove. Therefore, the assumptions and problem are as above.",
