    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The title is \"An inequality: 1 + 1/2² + 1/3² + ... + 1/n² < 5/3\". The question states that n is a positive integer, and the inequality is to be proven without referencing the famous Basel problem result (π²/6). The user also mentions their method involving breaking the sum into the first 10 terms and then using a telescoping series for the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem states that n is a positive integer. There's no mention of additional constraints like n being greater than a certain number or any divisibility conditions. However, the user's method splits the sum at n=10, but the original problem doesn't specify n being greater than or equal to 10. Wait, but maybe the user's approach is part of their solution attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The original problem just states n is a positive integer. So the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. The example in the problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, the problem states n is a positive integer, so that's the only assumption.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum 1 + 1/2² + ... + 1/n² is less than 5/3. The user wants to avoid using the Basel problem result and mentions their method, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should list the assumption that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the assumption included both n being an integer and n being divisible by 7. But in this problem, the only condition given is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumption section should just list that n is a positive integer. There's no other condition. The user's own method uses splitting at 10, but that's their approach, not part of the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$1+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\dotsb+\\frac{1}{n^2}\\lt\\frac{5}{3}.$$\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The original problem doesn't restrict n further. The user's solution attempt splits the sum at 10, but that's their method. The problem as posed just requires proving the inequality for all positive integers n. So yes, that's the correct formatting.",
