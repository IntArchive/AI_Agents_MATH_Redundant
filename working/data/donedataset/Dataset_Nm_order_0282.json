    "Content": "I was told by a tutor that if $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ has an invertible Jacobian Matrix for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\lim_{|x_k| \\rightarrow \\infty}|f(x_k)|=\\infty$ for all such sequences, then $f$ is already globally bijective. This was very surprising for me (as this seems to be a very strong statement), so I tried to search on the internet for this theorem but I only came up with theorems about local inverses. I hope someone here can give me a reference or a name of this theorem so I could read a detailed proof. I sanity checked it for $n=1$ where it works perfectly.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The result you ask about is called Hadamard's global inverse function theorem or sometimes Hadamard-Cacciopoli theorem . Googling these keywords reveals an entire industry of such local invertibility + something implies global bijectivity results. Unfortunately, I was unable to find an accessible proof of this result. Among several sources I looked at, by far the best bet seems to be the presentation in Section 6.2 of the beautiful book by S.G. Krantz and H.R. Parks, The implicit function theorem: history, theory, and applications , Birkhäuser, 2002. The proof given there is essentially self-contained and doesn't assume much knowledge on the reader's side. Nevertheless, I should point out that the title of Chapter 6 is Advanced implicit function theorems , so it's definitely not for the faint-hearted. In fact, a more general result is the following, also due to Jacques Hadamard . It is a bit, but not very much, harder to prove than the result you ask about. If you don't know what a manifold is, simply replace $M_1$ and $M_2$ by $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the theorem below, and you obtain the result you're asking about — for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ condition 3. is  satisfied and condition 1. translates precisely to the condition $\\lim\\limits_{|x| \\to \\infty} |f(x)| = \\infty$ your tutor told you. Theorem (Hadamard) Let $M_1, M_2$ be smooth and connected $n$-dimensional manifolds. Suppose $f: M_1 \\to M_2$ is a $C^1$-function such that $f$ is proper The Jacobian of $f$ is everywhere invertible $M_2$ is simply connected. Then $f$ is a homeomorphism (hence globally bijective). So, as I said, this theorem is not trivial at all and both this and the result you're interested in can be found in the book I mentioned above. Quite a bit of googling didn't yield a simple(r) proof of the theorem you ask about, but as you have the key-words now, maybe you find something that suits you. Added: I should have mentioned the better known Cartan-Hadamard theorem which is closely related but seems a bit more geometric in its nature.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original question is about global invertibility of a function f: ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ based on two conditions: everywhere local invertibility (Jacobian matrix is invertible for all x) and a limit condition (the norm of f(x) tends to infinity as the norm of x tends to infinity). The user's tutor claimed that these two conditions imply global bijectivity, and the user is looking for a reference or name of the theorem.\n\nNow, following the example provided, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then, state the problem concisely.\n\nFirst, the assumptions. The function f maps ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ. The Jacobian matrix of f is invertible everywhere, which is a local condition. Then, there's the limit condition: for any sequence x_k where |x_k| approaches infinity, |f(x_k)| also approaches infinity. So these are two separate assumptions on f.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: f is a map from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ.\n\nAssumption 2: The Jacobian matrix of f is invertible for all x in ℝⁿ.\n\nAssumption 3: For every sequence (x_k) in ℝⁿ such that |x_k| → ∞ as k → ∞, it follows that |f(x_k)| → ∞.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that f is globally bijective under these assumptions.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the user listed \"n is an integer\" as one assumption and \"n is divisible by 7\" as another. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property.\n\nSo applying that here, each condition should be a separate line. Let me check the original question again:\n\nThe user's tutor said that if f: ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ has invertible Jacobian for all x, and the limit as |x|→∞ of |f(x)| is infinity, then f is globally bijective. So the two main conditions are invertible Jacobian everywhere and the limit condition. But the domain and codomain are also ℝⁿ, which might be considered an assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ is a function.\n\n- The Jacobian matrix of f is invertible for all x ∈ ℝⁿ.\n\n- For every sequence (xₖ) in ℝⁿ with |xₖ| → ∞ as k → ∞, it follows that |f(xₖ)| → ∞.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is globally bijective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first assumption is redundant since the problem states f: ℝⁿ→ℝⁿ. But according to the example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So perhaps it's better to list all explicit conditions as separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have three assumptions:\n\n1. f is a function from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ.\n\n2. The Jacobian matrix of f is invertible at every point x in ℝⁿ.\n\n3. For every sequence (xₖ) in ℝⁿ where the norm |xₖ| approaches infinity as k approaches infinity, the norm |f(xₖ)| also approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is globally bijective.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", so maybe in that case, the assumption was that n is an integer, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but perhaps there was a typo? Wait, the example says the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem has assumption n is divisible by 7. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. So perhaps there was a mistake in the example, but the user provided it as their own example. Maybe the original problem had a different condition, but the user restructured it with an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be an error. But regardless, we have to follow the user's example structure.\n\nIn the user's example, they listed assumptions as n is integer and n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps in that case, the user made a mistake, but the instruction is to follow the format, which in their example includes possibly redundant or incorrect assumptions.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original question states the function is from ℝⁿ to ℝⁿ, which is part of the problem statement. So in the assumptions, we should list that f: ℝⁿ→ℝⁿ. Then, the two conditions given by the tutor: invertible Jacobian everywhere and the limit condition. So three assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a map from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$,\nThe Jacobian matrix of $f$ is invertible for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$,\nFor every sequence $(x_k)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $|x_k| \\rightarrow \\infty$, $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} |f(x_k)| = \\infty$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is globally bijective.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property or condition. The first establishes the domain and codomain, the second the invertible Jacobian, the third the limit condition.",
