    "Content": "While I was looking at the values of the zeta function for the first natural numbers, I noticed that the sum of the values minus $1$ , converge to $1$ . Better put: $$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(n)-1\\right) = 1 $$ Furthermore, if you use only the even numbers for the zeta function, the sum will converge to $\\frac{3}{4}$ , or $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(2n)-1\\right) = \\frac{3}{4}$$ Leaving $$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(2n-1)-1 \\right)= \\frac{1}{4}$$ This is probably common knowledge among mathematicians, but I couldn't find much about it on the internet. Is there a proof of this or perhaps even a simple explanation why this is so?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem according to their specified structure. The example they provided shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object, and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange:\n\nTitle: Why does the ∑_{n>1}(ζ(n)-1)=1?\n\nQuestion: The user observed that the sum from n=2 to infinity of (ζ(n) - 1) equals 1. They also mention that using even numbers for zeta (i.e., ζ(2n)) summed similarly gives 3/4, leading to the sum of ζ(2n-1)-1 from n=2 onward being 1/4. They ask for a proof or explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem involves the Riemann zeta function. The key points here are:\n\n1. The sum starts from n=2 to infinity for the first series.\n2. Each term in the series is ζ(n) - 1.\n3. The sum of these terms equals 1.\n4. For even integers (n=1 to ∞, ζ(2n) -1 sums to 3/4.\n5. Then, for odd integers starting from n=2, ζ(2n-1) -1 sums to 1/4.\n\nBut wait, the assumptions should be the given conditions or properties. In the problem statement, the user is presenting these sums as facts and asking why they hold. However, in the example provided, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to explain why these sums equal 1, 3/4, and 1/4. So the assumptions might be the definitions or properties of the zeta function that are implicitly used here.\n\nBut the user's example extracted the assumptions from the problem statement. The original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions listed were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in that example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, it's listed as an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. The user might have made a mistake in their example. But following their example, perhaps the user wants to list the given conditions as assumptions. However, in the current problem, the question is about the sum of ζ(n)-1 from n=2 to infinity equals 1. The problem itself is asking for the explanation or proof. So the assumptions here would be the properties of the zeta function that are being used, but in the problem statement, the user is presenting the sums as observed facts. However, in the example, the assumption included n being an integer, even though the problem statement already specified \"for every integer n\". So maybe the user wants to list the domain of n as an assumption.\n\nLooking at the current problem:\n\nThe problem statement is to explain why ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) = 1, ∑_{n=1}^∞ (ζ(2n)-1) = 3/4, and ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(2n-1)-1) = 1/4.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 in the first sum.\n- ζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function.\n- The series converges.\n\nBut the example given by the user includes assumptions that are conditions on n. So perhaps in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For the first sum, n is an integer such that n ≥ 2.\n- For the second sum, n is an integer such that n ≥ 1.\n- For the third sum, n is an integer such that n ≥ 2.\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBut the problem is to prove these sums. Wait, but the user's example transformed the original problem into a problem with assumptions. Wait, perhaps the user wants to split the problem into assumptions (the given conditions) and the problem (what needs to be proven). In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, maybe I need to follow their structure even if it's inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps in their example, they wanted to highlight that even though the problem says \"for every integer n\", maybe there was a typo and the actual problem assumes n divisible by 7. But since I need to follow their example, even if it's incorrect, perhaps I should list the assumptions as per the problem's implicit conditions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking why the sums equal those values. So the assumptions would be that ζ(n) is defined as the sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^n, and that the sums converge. But since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the assumptions are just the definitions and convergence. But the user's example listed assumptions as conditions on n. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that's contradictory. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which is a restriction. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to include both conditions, but the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user wants to list all conditions that are given in the problem. In the current problem, the conditions are that the sums are from n=2 to infinity, etc. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- For the first sum, n starts at 2 and goes to infinity.\n- For the second sum, n starts at 1 and goes to infinity, and only even integers are considered.\n- For the third sum, n starts at 2 and goes to infinity, and only odd integers are considered.\n- ζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBut the problem statement in the user's example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, which might indicate that the user wants to extract any implicit assumptions. However, in this case, the original problem is asking why the sums equal those values. The assumptions here would be the definitions of the zeta function and the convergence of the series. But the user's example seems to list the domain of n and any conditions on n. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the assumptions are:\n\n- For the first problem, n is an integer with n ≥ 2.\n- For the second problem, n is an integer with n ≥ 1.\n- For the third problem, n is an integer with n ≥ 2.\n- The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is defined for real numbers s > 1.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function,\nthe series ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) - 1) converges,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 1,\nζ(2n) is the Riemann zeta function,\nthe series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (ζ(2n) - 1) converges,\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nζ(2n - 1) is the Riemann zeta function,\nthe series ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(2n - 1) - 1) converges.\n\nBut this seems redundant. Alternatively, since the problem has three separate sums, maybe each sum is a separate problem. But the user's example had one problem. In the current case, the problem is to explain why the three sums hold. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format, which includes listing assumptions and then the problem. The example combined multiple conditions into assumptions even if they were part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is what needs to be proven. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Therefore, for the current problem, the assumptions should be the given conditions, such as the definition of ζ(n), the summation indices, etc.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the assumptions to be the properties that are given in the problem statement. For example, in the current problem, the user observed that the sum of ζ(n)-1 from n=2 converges to 1. The problem is to prove this. So the assumptions would be the definitions and the convergence, but since the problem is to explain why the sum equals 1, the assumptions are the conditions under which the sum is taken. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function,\nthe series ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) - 1) converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) - 1) = 1.\n\nSimilarly for the other sums. But the user's example combined multiple conditions into the assumptions. Since the example's original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which contradicts the original. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but I should follow the structure as per their instruction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem. In the current case, the problem is to explain why those sums equal 1, 3/4, and 1/4. The key assumptions are that ζ(n) is defined as the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k^n, and that the series converge. But since the problem is asking for the explanation, the assumptions would be the definitions and convergence.\n\nBut following the user's example, which listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions for the problem where the original statement was \"for every integer n\", perhaps the user expects to list the domain of n and any conditions. In this case, the problem has three parts:\n\n1. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) =1\n2. ∑_{n=1}^∞ (ζ(2n) -1) = 3/4\n3. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(2n-1) -1) =1/4\n\nBut the user's example only formatted one problem. The current problem in the question includes all three. However, the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the format. So perhaps each sum is a separate problem, but the user's original question is asking about all three. Alternatively, the problem is to explain all three.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is the main sum (the first one), and the others are corollaries. But the user mentioned all three in the problem statement. So perhaps the formatted problem includes all three sums.\n\nBut according to the user's example, they extracted the assumptions from the problem. The example's original problem had a mistake in the assumptions. So perhaps the user wants me to list the assumptions as:\n\n- For the first sum: n is an integer ≥2\n- For the second sum: n is an integer ≥1\n- For the third sum: n is an integer ≥2\n- ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each line should be a single assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nζ(2m) is the Riemann zeta function,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 2,\nζ(2k -1) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nBut this seems overly detailed. Alternatively, since all sums involve the zeta function, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function,\nn is an integer ≥ 2,\nm is an integer ≥ 1,\nk is an integer ≥ 2.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) =1\n2. ∑_{m=1}^∞ (ζ(2m) -1) = 3/4\n3. ∑_{k=2}^∞ (ζ(2k -1) -1) =1/4\n\nBut the user's example listed assumptions line by line, each for one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 2,\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function for s > 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) =1\n2. ∑_{m=1}^∞ (ζ(2m) -1) = 3/4\n3. ∑_{k=2}^∞ (ζ(2k -1) -1) =1/4\n\nBut the problem statement in the original question is asking for an explanation or proof of these three sums. So perhaps the problem should be written as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n$$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(n) - 1\\right) = 1,$$\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(2n) - 1\\right) = \\frac{3}{4}, \\text{ and}$$\n$$\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\zeta(2n-1) - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.$$\n\nAnd the assumptions would be the conditions on n and the definition of ζ.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each for one object. So, each variable and condition. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 2,\nζ(s) is defined for real numbers s > 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sums equal the respective values.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants to list each variable's condition separately. So, for each summation variable, list their constraints.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions, even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\", perhaps in this case, we list:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function at n.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sum ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) equals 1, ∑_{m=1}^∞ (ζ(2m) -1) equals 3/4, and ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(2n-1) -1) equals 1/4.\n\nBut the user's example formatted the problem to have assumptions and the problem. Given the confusion from the example, but following the instruction to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition to one object, here's what I'll do:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nζ(2m) is the Riemann zeta function,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 2,\nζ(2k -1) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) =1,\n2. ∑_{m=1}^∞ (ζ(2m) -1) = 3/4,\n3. ∑_{k=2}^∞ (ζ(2k -1) -1) =1/4.\n\nBut this seems repetitive, but according to the user's example, each condition is listed separately. So each variable's condition is an assumption. Hence, n being integer and ≥2 are separate assumptions. Similarly for m and k. Each zeta function application is an assumption as well. But perhaps that's overkill. Alternatively, group them by variable:\n\nAssumption:\nFor the first sum: n is an integer ≥2,\nFor the second sum: m is an integer ≥1,\nFor the third sum: k is an integer ≥2,\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function for s >1.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn ≥ 2,\nm is an integer,\nm ≥ 1,\nk is an integer,\nk ≥ 2,\nζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function for s >1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that:\n1. ∑_{n=2}^∞ (ζ(n) -1) =1,\n2. ∑_{m=1}^∞ (ζ(2m) -1) = 3/4,\n3. ∑_{k=2}^∞ (ζ(2k -1) -1) =1/4.\n\nThis way, each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition or property. That seems to fit the example's format, even if the example had an inconsistency. Therefore, I'll structure it this way.",
