    "Content": "I am trying to show an algebraic number field $F$ is the field of fractions of its ring of integers $D_F$. I presume that what I have to show is that for any non-zero $b \\in F$, where $b = c/d$ that $c, d \\in D_F$ I have started by assuming $b\\in F$ is an algebraic number. I can show that any element of $F$ (as an algebraic number field) satisfies a not-necessarily monic polynomial. And clearing denominators, the polynomial becomes: $a_nb^n + a_{n - 1}b^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_0 = 0$ where $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ Then multiplying through by $a_n^{n - 1}$ gives a monic polynomial with integral coefficients: $(a_{n}b)^n + a_{n - 1}(a_{n}b)^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_{n}^{n - 1}a_0 = 0$, so $a_{n}b \\in D_F$ Hopefully I'm on the right track. I would appreciate any corrections to what I've done. And if this is correct, I would appreciate help finishing. Thanks very much.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are on the right track.\nHowever, $(a_{n}b)^n + a_{n - 1}(a_{n}b)^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_{n}a_0 = 0$, so $a_{n}b \\in D_F$ This should be $(a_{n}b)^n + a_{n - 1}(a_{n}b)^{n - 1} + \\dots + a_{n}^{n-1}a_0 = 0$, so $a_{n}b \\in D_F$ Since $b = \\frac{a_nb}{a_n}$ and $a_n \\in D_F$, $F$ is the field of fractions of $D_F$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that an algebraic number field F is the field of fractions of its ring of integers D_F. The user has some steps they've started but wants to verify and get help to finish.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The problem states that F is an algebraic number field, so that's one assumption. Then, they mention that D_F is its ring of integers. The user is trying to show that F is the field of fractions of D_F, which means every element of F can be written as a fraction of elements from D_F. \n\nIn their approach, they take a non-zero element b in F, express it as c/d, and aim to show c and d are in D_F. They mention that any element of F satisfies a polynomial equation with integer coefficients (not necessarily monic), then clear denominators to get a monic polynomial by multiplying through by a_n^{n-1}. This leads them to conclude that a_n * b is in D_F. \n\nSo the assumptions here would be: F is an algebraic number field, D_F is the ring of integers of F, and the user is assuming that any element b in F can be expressed as c/d where c and d are algebraic integers. Wait, but actually, the problem is to show that F is the field of fractions of D_F, which means for any b in F, there exist c, d in D_F such that b = c/d. The user's approach involves taking the minimal polynomial of b over Q, clearing denominators to make it monic, and then using that to find a multiple of b that's in D_F. \n\nSo the key assumptions here are: F is an algebraic number field, D_F is its ring of integers, and every element of F can be written as a quotient of two elements from D_F. But in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove that, so the assumptions would be the given conditions. Let me parse the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Show that an algebraic number field F is the field of fractions of its ring of integers D_F.\" The user starts by assuming that for any non-zero b in F, b = c/d with c, d in D_F. The steps they take involve showing that a_n * b is in D_F, which would mean that b = (a_n * b)/a_n, so if a_n is in D_F, then a_n is an algebraic integer. But a_n is an integer coefficient from the minimal polynomial, right? So integers are in D_F because D_F includes all algebraic integers in F, and integers are algebraic integers. Therefore, a_n is in D_F. So then, since a_n * b is in D_F, then b can be written as (a_n * b)/a_n, which is a quotient of two elements of D_F. Hence, F is the field of fractions of D_F.\n\nSo the problem's assumptions would be that F is an algebraic number field and D_F is its ring of integers. The problem is to show F is the field of fractions of D_F. The user's approach uses the fact that elements of F satisfy monic polynomials with integer coefficients after scaling, which is a standard approach in algebraic number theory.\n\nTherefore, structuring according to the format:\n\nAssumption: F is an algebraic number field.\nAssumption: D_F is the ring of integers of F.\nProblem: Show that F is the field of fractions of D_F.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem statement, it was \"for every integer n\". However, in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem didn't state the divisibility by 7. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That might be a mistake, or perhaps the user intended to modify the problem? Wait, perhaps the example is not from the same original problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the user's example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut this is conflicting. The original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as an example of how to format. But according to that example, perhaps the user wants to split the problem into the necessary assumptions. Wait, but 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem actually required n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but perhaps the example was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show that when n is divisible by 7, the expression is divisible by 91. But this is unclear.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the user's original question is to show that an algebraic number field F is the field of fractions of its ring of integers D_F. The assumptions here are that F is an algebraic number field and D_F is its ring of integers. The problem is to prove that F is the field of fractions of D_F. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be those two, and the problem statement is to show F is the field of fractions of D_F.\n\nBut in the example, the user included assumptions beyond what was stated. For instance, in the original problem, the example had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe the user wants to extract all implicit assumptions. Wait, perhaps the example was modified. Maybe the original problem actually had a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps the example was a mistake, but the user wants us to follow the structure where each assumption is a single property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- F is an algebraic number field.\n\n- D_F is the ring of integers of F.\n\nThe problem is to show F is the field of fractions of D_F. So according to the example's structure, we need to list each assumption line by line. Here, the two main assumptions are F being an algebraic number field and D_F being its ring of integers. The problem is to show F is the field of fractions of D_F.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption: F is an algebraic number field.\n\nAssumption: D_F is the ring of integers of F.\n\nProblem: Show that F is the field of fractions of D_F.\n\nBut looking at the user's own attempt, they mention that for any non-zero b in F, b can be written as c/d with c, d in D_F. The user's approach is to take b in F, find a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, clear denominators to get a monic polynomial, then show that a_n * b is in D_F, hence b = (a_n b)/a_n. Since a_n is an integer, hence in D_F, then a_n b is in D_F, so c = a_n b and d = a_n are in D_F. Thus, F is contained in the field of fractions of D_F. Conversely, since D_F is contained in F, the field of fractions is F. Hence, done.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are F is an algebraic number field and D_F is its ring of integers. The problem is to show F is the field of fractions of D_F. So the formatted problem would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: $F$ is an algebraic number field.\nAssumption: $D_F$ is the ring of integers of $F$.\nProblem: Show that $F$ is the field of fractions of $D_F$.",
