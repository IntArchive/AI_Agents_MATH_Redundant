    "Content": "I've found this while googling some properties of positive semidefinite matrices. (Unfortunately, I cannot remember where I've discovered it.) If this is true, it'll greatly save my time in my work. Is it true? How can you prove it? Let's say I have two real symmetric and positive definite matrices $\\mathbf A$ and $\\mathbf B$ of the same size. Also, assume that $\\mathbf A - \\mathbf B$ is positive semidefinite too. Then, $\\mathbf B^{-1} - \\mathbf A^{-1}$ is also positive semidefinite.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. Here is one way to prove it: Since $A-B\\geq0$, we have (conjugating with $B^{-1/2}$) that $B^{-1/2}AB^{-1/2}-I\\geq0$. This tells you that all the eigenvalues of the positive definite matrix $B^{-1/2}AB^{-1/2}$ are $\\geq1$. Now note that $B^{-1/2}AB^{-1/2}=(B^{-1/2}A^{1/2})(A^{1/2}B^{-1/2})$. Since commuting the product of two matrices does not change the eigenvalues, we get that $A^{1/2}B^{-1/2}B^{-1/2}A^{1/2}=A^{1/2}B^{-1}A^{1/2}$ has also all eigenvalues $\\geq1$. So\n$$\nA^{1/2}B^{-1}A^{1/2}-I\\geq0.\n$$\nNow conjugating with $A^{-1/2}$ we get $B^{-1}-A^{-1}\\geq0$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking whether if A and B are positive definite matrices, and A - B is positive semidefinite, then does it follow that B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is also positive semidefinite. Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand all the conditions here.\n\nSo, the assumptions given in the problem are that both A and B are real, symmetric, positive definite matrices of the same size. Then, it's stated that A - B is positive semidefinite. The question is whether B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is positive semidefinite under these conditions.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says \"positive definite\" for A and B, but then the difference A - B is positive semidefinite. The user wants to know if the inverse difference is also positive semidefinite. Let me recall some properties of positive definite matrices and their inverses.\n\nI remember that if A is positive definite, then its inverse is also positive definite. Also, if A and B are positive definite and A ≻ B (meaning A - B is positive definite), then it's not necessarily true that B⁻¹ ≻ A⁻¹. But here, it's positive semidefinite. Wait, maybe there's a relation when subtracting inverses.\n\nLet me think about the scalar case first. If a and b are positive scalars, then a > b implies 1/b - 1/a > 0. Because 1/b - 1/a = (a - b)/(ab). Since a > b, numerator is positive, denominator is positive, so the difference is positive. So in scalars, yes, if a ≥ b > 0, then 1/b - 1/a ≥ 0. So maybe this generalizes to matrices?\n\nBut matrices are trickier because you can't just divide like scalars. The equivalent would be something involving inverses. Maybe using the fact that if A ≥ B (in Loewner order), then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹, provided that A and B are positive definite. Is that a known result?\n\nWait, yes, I think there's a theorem that says if A and B are positive definite and A ≥ B (i.e., A - B is positive semidefinite), then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹. So this would imply that B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is positive semidefinite. But how to verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider using the identity B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹(A - B)A⁻¹. Wait, let me check that. Let's compute B⁻¹ - A⁻¹. Multiply both sides by B and A on left and right respectively. Let's see:\n\nB(B⁻¹ - A⁻¹)A = (I - B A⁻¹) A = A - B. So B(B⁻¹ - A⁻¹)A = A - B. Therefore, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹(A - B)A⁻¹. Hmm, is that correct? Let me do the algebra again:\n\nStarting with B⁻¹ - A⁻¹. Let's factor out B⁻¹ on the left and A⁻¹ on the right. Wait:\n\nB⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹ (I - B A⁻¹) = B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹. Because I - B A⁻¹ = (A - B) A⁻¹. Because (A - B) A⁻¹ = I - B A⁻¹. So yes, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹.\n\nTherefore, since A and B are positive definite, their inverses are also positive definite. The matrix A - B is positive semidefinite by assumption. Then, B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ is a product involving positive semidefinite matrices. But wait, the product of positive semidefinite matrices isn't necessarily positive semidefinite unless they commute. However, in this case, we have B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹. Let's note that B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are positive definite, but (A - B) is positive semidefinite. However, the product here is B⁻¹ times (A - B) times A⁻¹. Since B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are symmetric, but when multiplied with (A - B), which is also symmetric, perhaps the entire product is symmetric? Wait, B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ is not necessarily symmetric unless the matrices commute. But B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ might not commute with (A - B). Hmm, maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that since A ≥ B, then for any vector x, x^T A x ≥ x^T B x. Then, how does this translate to inverses? For inverses, the inequality reverses? Wait, in scalar case, if a ≥ b > 0, then 1/a ≤ 1/b. So the inverse reverses the inequality. But for matrices, the Loewner order is not so straightforward. However, if A ≥ B > 0 (as positive definite matrices), then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹. This is a known result. For example, if A ≥ B > 0, then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹ ≥ 0. The proof of this involves using the fact that if A ≥ B, then B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2} ≥ I, which implies that (B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2})^{-1} ≤ I, so A^{-1} ≤ B^{-1}. Therefore, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, in this case, since A - B is positive semidefinite, then B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is also positive semidefinite. Therefore, the answer is yes, the statement is true.\n\nBut let me verify this with an example. Let’s take A and B as 2x2 diagonal matrices. Let’s say A = [[2, 0],[0, 2]] and B = [[1, 0],[0, 1]]. Then, A - B = [[1,0],[0,1]] which is positive definite. Then, B⁻¹ is [[1,0],[0,1]], A⁻¹ is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. So B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], which is positive definite. So that works.\n\nAnother example: Let A = [[3,0],[0,3]] and B = [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then A - B is [[2,0],[0,2]], positive definite. B⁻¹ is [[1,0],[0,1]], A⁻¹ is [[1/3,0],[0,1/3]], so B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is [[2/3,0],[0,2/3]], which is positive definite. Okay.\n\nWhat if A and B are not diagonal? Let’s take A as [[2,1],[1,2]] which is positive definite. Its eigenvalues are 3 and 1. Let’s take B = [[1,0],[0,1]], which is positive definite. Then A - B = [[1,1],[1,1]], which is a matrix with eigenvalues 2 and 0, so it's positive semidefinite. Then, B⁻¹ is still [[1,0],[0,1]], and A⁻¹ is [[2/3, -1/3],[-1/3, 2/3]]. Then, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = [[1 - 2/3, 0 + 1/3],[0 + 1/3, 1 - 2/3]] = [[1/3, 1/3],[1/3, 1/3]]. This matrix has eigenvalues (sum of the diagonal ± sqrt of the off-diagonal squared terms) which for [[1/3,1/3],[1/3,1/3]] the eigenvalues are 2/3 and 0. So it's positive semidefinite. Which matches the conclusion.\n\nSo the statement seems to hold. Therefore, the answer is yes, and the proof can be done via the known matrix inequality that if A ≥ B > 0, then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹. The key steps involve using the Loewner order properties and possibly the identity B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹(A - B)A⁻¹, which, when A - B is positive semidefinite, and considering that B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are positive definite, the product would be positive semidefinite. However, one must be careful because the product of symmetric matrices isn't necessarily symmetric unless they commute. But in this case, the expression B⁻¹(A - B)A⁻¹ is actually congruent to A - B via the matrix A^{-1/2} B^{-1/2} or something like that. Alternatively, using the fact that congruence transformations preserve positive semidefiniteness. Since B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are positive definite, multiplying on both sides by them would preserve the positive semidefiniteness. But this might need a more precise argument.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity that if X is positive semidefinite and C is invertible, then C^T X C is also positive semidefinite. Here, if we write B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ as C^T X C, where C is something. Let me see. Let’s note that B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ can be written as B^{-1} (A - B) A^{-1}. Let’s factor this as B^{-1} A^{-1} (A - B). Wait, but that's not the same. Alternatively, maybe write it as B^{-1} (A - B) A^{-1} = (B^{-1} A) - (B^{-1} B) A^{-1} = B^{-1} A - A^{-1}. Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, consider that A and B are symmetric, so B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are symmetric. Then, the product B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ is equal to (A⁻¹ (A - B) B⁻¹)^T because (ABC)^T = C^T B^T A^T. Since A and B are symmetric, A⁻¹ and B⁻¹ are symmetric, so this would be (A⁻¹ (A - B) B⁻¹)^T = B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹. Hence, the matrix is symmetric. Therefore, B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ is symmetric. Then, since (A - B) is positive semidefinite, and B⁻¹ and A⁻¹ are positive definite, then the product is similar to a congruence transformation. Wait, congruence transformation is C X C^T. If we have B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹, which is equal to B^{-1} (A - B) A^{-1}. Let me write C = B^{-1/2} and D = A^{-1/2}, then perhaps:\n\nB⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ = B^{-1/2} B^{-1/2} (A - B) A^{-1/2} A^{-1/2} = B^{-1/2} [ B^{-1/2} (A - B) A^{-1/2} ] A^{-1/2}\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that for any vector x, x^T (B⁻¹ - A⁻¹) x should be non-negative. Let's compute this:\n\nx^T (B⁻¹ - A⁻¹) x = x^T B⁻¹ x - x^T A⁻¹ x.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ = B⁻¹(A - B)A⁻¹, then x^T (B⁻¹ - A⁻¹) x = x^T B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ x.\n\nLet’s let y = A⁻¹ x. Then, the expression becomes y^T A (A - B) y. Wait, no:\n\nWait, x^T B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ x = (A⁻¹ x)^T (A - B) (B⁻¹ x). Wait, maybe not. Let me try again. Let’s define y = B^{-1/2} x, then x = B^{1/2} y. Substitute into the expression:\n\nx^T B⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ x = y^T B^{1/2} B^{-1} (A - B) A⁻¹ B^{1/2} y = y^T B^{-1/2} (A - B) A⁻¹ B^{1/2} y.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe consider that since A - B is positive semidefinite, then for any vector z, z^T (A - B) z ≥ 0. Let’s set z = A⁻¹ x. Then, z^T (A - B) z = x^T A⁻¹ (A - B) A⁻¹ x = x^T (A⁻¹ - A⁻¹ B A⁻¹) x.\n\nBut this seems different from the previous expression. Wait, perhaps we need to relate this to the original expression. Let me think differently.\n\nSince A and B are positive definite and A - B is positive semidefinite, then for any x, x^T (A - B) x ≥ 0. Let’s consider the following: Let’s take x = A^{1/2} y. Then, x^T (A - B) x = y^T A^{1/2} (A - B) A^{1/2} y = y^T (A^{1/2} A A^{1/2} - A^{1/2} B A^{1/2}) y = y^T (A^2 - A^{1/2} B A^{1/2}) y. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that if A ≥ B, then B⁻¹ ≥ A⁻¹. This can be shown by noting that A ≥ B implies B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2} ≥ I. Then taking inverses of both sides (since they are positive definite), we get (B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2})^{-1} ≤ I, which is B^{1/2} A⁻¹ B^{1/2} ≤ I. Then multiplying both sides by B^{-1/2} on the left and right gives A⁻¹ ≤ B⁻¹. Hence, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion holds. Thus, the problem's answer is yes, B⁻¹ - A⁻¹ is positive semidefinite under the given assumptions.",
