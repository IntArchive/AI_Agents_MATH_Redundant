    "Content": "How would one go about showing the polar version of the Cauchy Riemann Equations are sufficient to get differentiability of a complex valued function which has continuous partial derivatives? I haven't found any proof of this online. One of my ideas was writing out $r$ and $\\theta$ in terms of $x$ and $y$, then taking the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and showing the Cauchy Riemann equations in the Cartesian coordinate system are satisfied. A problem with this approach is that derivatives get messy. What are some other ways to do it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I happen to have some notes on this question. What follows here is the usual approach, it's just multivariate calculus paired with the Cauchy Riemann equations. I have an idea for an easier way, I'll post it as a second answer in a bit if it works. If we use polar coordinates to rewrite $f$ as follows:\n$$ f(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta)) = u(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta))+iv(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta)) $$\nwe use shorthands $F(r,\\theta)=f(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta))$ and $U(r,\\theta )=u(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta))$ and $V(r,\\theta )=v(x(r,\\theta),y(r,\\theta))$. We derive the CR-equations in polar coordinates via the chain rule from multivariate calculus,\n$$ U_r = x_ru_x + y_ru_y = \\cos(\\theta)u_x + \\sin(\\theta)u_y \\ \\\n\\text{and} \\ \\ U_{\\theta} = x_{\\theta}u_x + y_{\\theta}u_y = -r\\sin(\\theta)u_x + r\\cos(\\theta)u_y $$\nLikewise,\n$$ V_r = x_rv_x + y_rv_y = \\cos(\\theta)v_x + \\sin(\\theta)v_y \\ \\\n\\text{and} \\ \\ V_{\\theta} = x_{\\theta}v_x + y_{\\theta}v_y = -r\\sin(\\theta)v_x + r\\cos(\\theta)v_y $$\nWe can write these in matrix notation as follows:\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{l} U_r \\\\ U_{\\theta} \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ -r\\sin(\\theta) & r\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right]\\left[ \\begin{array}{l} u_x \\\\ u_y \\end{array} \\right] \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \n\\left[ \\begin{array}{l} V_r \\\\ V_{\\theta} \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ -r\\sin(\\theta) & r\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right]\\left[ \\begin{array}{l} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{array} \\right] $$\nMultiply these by the inverse matrix: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\cos(\\theta) & \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ -r\\sin(\\theta) & r\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{r}\\left[ \\begin{array}{ll} r\\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ r\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right]$ to find\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{l} u_x \\\\ u_y \\end{array} \\right] = \\frac{1}{r}\\left[ \\begin{array}{ll} r\\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ r\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right]\\left[ \\begin{array}{l} U_r \\\\ U_{\\theta} \\end{array} \\right] =  \\left[ \\begin{array}{l} \\cos(\\theta)U_r - \\tfrac{1}{r}\\sin(\\theta)U_{\\theta} \\\\ \n\\sin(\\theta)U_r + \\tfrac{1}{r}\\cos(\\theta)U_{\\theta} \\end{array} \\right] $$\nA similar calculation holds for $V$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list assumptions line by line and then state the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is \"Proof of Cauchy Riemann Equations in Polar Coordinates\". The user is asking how to show that the polar version of the Cauchy-Riemann equations are sufficient for differentiability of a complex function with continuous partial derivatives. They mentioned trying to convert to Cartesian coordinates but found it messy.\n\nSo, the main problem here is to prove that satisfying the polar CR equations plus having continuous partial derivatives implies differentiability. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Let's break it down.\n\nThe problem states that the function has continuous partial derivatives. That's one assumption. Then, the polar CR equations are satisfied—that's another. Also, the function is complex-valued, which is another condition. Each assumption should be on its own line, addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"sufficient to get differentiability of a complex valued function which has continuous partial derivatives.\" So the function has continuous partial derivatives, and satisfies the polar CR equations. So the assumptions are:\n\n1. The function is complex-valued.\n2. The function has continuous partial derivatives.\n3. The function satisfies the polar Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to show that under these conditions, the function is differentiable.\n\nLet me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Each on separate lines.\n\nSo here, the problem is to prove sufficiency of polar CR equations with continuous partial derivatives for differentiability. Therefore, the assumptions should list the conditions on the function. Let me structure that.",
