    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hardy recorded in his 1937 papers that the formula was discovered by Ramanujan, who did not profess to prove such an identity. Hardy published his proof, which was based on the \"Plana's formula\" (A proof of Plana's formula can be found here ). Here is an outline of Hardy's original proof. I doubt whether an \" elementary \" proof exists(without complex analysis). The Plana's formula asserts that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}f(n)-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(x)dx=\\frac{1}{2}f(0)+i\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{f(it)-f(-it)}{e^{2\\pi t}-1}dt$$ Let $f(u)=1/\\Gamma(u)$, then $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n!}-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(x)}dx=i\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1/\\Gamma(it)-1/\\Gamma(-it)}{e^{2\\pi t}-1}dt$$ An elementary transform of RHS gives $$i\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1/\\Gamma(it)-1/\\Gamma(-it)}{e^{2\\pi t}-1}dt=-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{1/\\Gamma(it)}{\\sin \\pi i t}e^{-\\pi\\vert t\\vert}dt$$ Also $$e^{-\\pi\\vert t\\vert}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{u^{it}}{u(\\pi^2+\\log^2u)}du$$ Then RHS is equal to $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{u^{it}}{u(\\pi^2+\\log^2u)}\\frac{-1/\\Gamma(it)}{2\\sin \\pi i t}dudt$$ Mellin transform gives $$-\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{C}\\frac{\\pi u^{z-1}}{\\Gamma(z)\\sin \\pi z}dz=-e^{-u}$$ where C is the imaginary axis.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of one object. The problem is then stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: the title is about proving an integral identity involving the gamma function, and the question asks if there's an elementary proof. The identity given is the integral from 0 to infinity of 1/Gamma(x) dx equals e plus another integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-x)/(pi² + (ln x)²) dx.\n\nSo, I need to extract the assumptions here. The problem states an equality between two integrals. The assumptions would be the conditions under which this equality holds. However, the problem as presented doesn't mention any specific conditions; it just states the identity. The user in the question is asking for an elementary proof, implying that the identity is already established but they want a simpler proof.\n\nIn the example given earlier, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But here, the problem is an integral identity. Integral identities usually hold under certain conditions like convergence, domain of integration, etc. But since the problem is presented as an identity without specifying conditions, perhaps the only assumption is that the integrals are convergent over the given limits. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state any assumptions, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions provided by the user. However, to list assumptions properly, perhaps we need to infer from the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is about integrating 1/Gamma(x) from 0 to infinity. Gamma(x) is defined for all real numbers except non-positive integers. However, near x=0, Gamma(x) behaves like 1/x, so 1/Gamma(x) behaves like x, which is integrable near zero. As x approaches infinity, Gamma(x) grows very rapidly, so 1/Gamma(x) decays rapidly, making the integral convergent. Similarly, the other integral involves e^{-x} over pi² + (ln x)^2. As x approaches 0, ln x goes to -infinity, so the denominator grows, making the integrand behave nicely. As x approaches infinity, e^{-x} dominates, so the integral converges. So the integrals are convergent, but the problem statement doesn't specify any restrictions. Since the original problem doesn't mention any particular conditions, maybe the assumptions are just the standard ones for the integrals to converge. However, the example given earlier included specific assumptions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the user hasn't specified any, so perhaps the assumptions section is left with the implicit conditions necessary for the integrals to be valid. But according to the instructions, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Since the problem is to prove the equality, the main assumptions are the domains of integration (from 0 to infinity) and that the integrals are convergent. But maybe the problem as posed doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond the integrals being defined as such. Therefore, maybe the assumptions section here is empty, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem itself is the integral equality, and the assumptions are the standard mathematical conditions required for the integrals to make sense. But the original problem doesn't state them; it just presents the identity. So maybe in this case, the problem is to be taken at face value without additional assumptions beyond the integral limits. Therefore, the formatted problem would have no assumptions listed except perhaps the integrals are convergent. But according to the example, the assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem statement. For example, in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumption included n being an integer and n divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is redundant because the problem statement already says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the assumption section is for listing conditions that are given in the problem, even if they are part of the problem's premise. Therefore, in the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity, so the assumption would be that the variable x is integrated from 0 to infinity. But how to phrase that. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Similarly, here, the assumption could be that the integrals are taken over the interval [0, ∞). But the problem statement already mentions that. However, according to the example, even if the problem statement mentions \"for every integer n\", the assumption is listed as \"n is an integer\". So following that pattern, here the assumption would be that the integrals are from 0 to infinity. But the problem statement already includes that. Wait, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions necessary for the equality to hold. For example, if the problem is to prove an identity under certain conditions, but the original problem doesn't specify any beyond the integral limits. Since the problem is stated as an identity, perhaps the main assumption is that the integrals converge. However, the user might not state that explicitly. In the example, the problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed that as an assumption. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" However, the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait, the user's example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, there's an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem's assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\", unless there was a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect, but according to the user's instruction, we have to follow it. But in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Unless there was a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But according to the user's instruction, we have to follow their example. So perhaps in their example, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as another assumption. But this is conflicting. Wait, maybe the original problem actually had a divisibility by 7 condition that wasn't included in the user's example. Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion. Anyway, following the user's example, they included assumptions that were perhaps part of the problem's hidden conditions. But given that, in the current problem, the integral identity is presented as is, and the user is asking for an elementary proof. The original problem states the identity, so the assumptions would be the conditions under which the identity holds. Since the problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions, the main assumption is that the integrals are convergent over [0, ∞). However, in the example, even if the problem says \"for every integer n\", they list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, which is redundant. So perhaps here, the assumption would be that the integrals are taken from 0 to infinity. But the problem statement already specifies that. So following the example, perhaps we need to list the variables and their domains. But the integral is in terms of x, and the limits are from 0 to infinity. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nThe integrand 1/Γ(x) is defined for x in [0, ∞),\nThe integrand e^{-x}/(π² + (ln x)²) is defined for x in [0, ∞).\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention these; it's part of the integral's definition. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality, the assumptions might just be the existence of the integrals. But in the example, the assumption included a condition that wasn't in the original problem. Maybe the user in the example made a mistake, but we need to follow the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user expects us to follow it regardless. Since in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps here, we need to list the variables and their domains. But in this problem, the variable is x, integrated from 0 to infinity. So the assumption would be that x is a real variable in [0, ∞). But the problem statement already specifies the integral from 0 to infinity, so maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the problem, so the assumptions section is empty. But in the example, even when the problem stated \"for every integer n\", the assumption was listed. So perhaps here, the assumption is that the integrals are over [0, ∞). However, the problem statement already specifies that. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions to list here. But the example had assumptions, so perhaps we need to find some. Since the problem involves Gamma function, maybe the assumption is that Γ(x) is the gamma function. But that's part of the definition. Alternatively, the problem might assume that the reader knows the definition of Γ(x), but that's not a mathematical condition. Alternatively, the assumption is that the integrals converge. But again, that's implicit. Given the example provided, where assumptions included conditions even if they were part of the problem statement, perhaps in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe variable x is real,\nx is integrated from 0 to ∞,\nΓ(x) is the gamma function.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the gamma function and the integral limits. So maybe following the example's structure, we list those as assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is an identity, perhaps there are no additional assumptions beyond the integral's limits. Given the confusion, but following the example where assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem statement, I think here the assumptions would include:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞) for both sides.\n- Γ(x) denotes the gamma function.\n\nBut the problem already states the integral from 0 to infinity and uses Γ(x), so maybe these are considered assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was listed as an assumption. So here, similarly, the integral's domain and the gamma function's definition are assumptions. But in reality, these are part of the problem's statement. However, following the user's example, they included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though the problem stated \"for every integer n\". Therefore, here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nΓ(x) is the gamma function.\n\nBut perhaps that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is as stated. However, the example shows that even if the problem states something, it's listed as an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is from 0 to ∞,\nThe function Γ(x) is the gamma function.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions beyond what is stated, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example shows that assumptions are extracted from the problem statement. Therefore, given that, the correct formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nΓ(x) denotes the gamma function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x = e + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{\\pi^2 + \\ln^2 x}\\, \\mathrm{d}x$$  \nand determine if there exists an elementary proof.\n\nWait, but the original problem already includes the integral limits and the gamma function notation. Therefore, following the example, even if the problem states \"for every integer n\", which is a universal quantifier, but the assumption lists \"n is an integer\". So here, similarly, even though the problem states the integrals from 0 to ∞, the assumption would list \"the integrals are taken over [0, ∞)\" and \"Γ(x) is the gamma function\". But perhaps the gamma function is considered part of the notation, not an assumption. The example didn't list \"5^n and 6^n are exponents\" as assumptions. Therefore, perhaps only the key conditions are listed. However, in the original example, the problem had \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Then the problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". But in that example, there was an additional assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the example's original problem had a different condition. Given the confusion, perhaps the safest way is to list the integral domains and the gamma function as assumptions. Alternatively, since the problem is to prove the equality as stated, and the user is asking for an elementary proof, maybe there are no additional assumptions beyond what's given. Therefore, the assumptions section would be empty. But that contradicts the example. This is a bit confusing. Given the user's example, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like an error. Perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow the structure regardless. In the current problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrals are convergent,\nThe variable x is real,\nΓ(x) is the gamma function.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't mention convergence, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. However, in the example, the assumption included a condition not in the original problem. Given the uncertainty, but following the example where assumptions were extracted from the problem statement (even if redundant), here's my attempt:\n\nThe problem is to prove the integral identity. The problem states the integrals from 0 to infinity, so the assumptions would include the integration limits. Also, the gamma function is used, so assuming that Γ(x) is the standard gamma function. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated over the interval [0, ∞),\nΓ(x) denotes the gamma function.\n\nProblem:\nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x = e + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{\\pi^2 + \\ln^2 x}\\, \\mathrm{d}x$$  \nand determine if there exists an elementary proof.\n\nBut the original question also asks \"Is there an elementary proof?\" So the problem part should include both proving the identity and determining if an elementary proof exists. However, in the example, the problem was just to prove the divisibility. So perhaps the problem here is:\n\nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x = e + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{\\pi^2 + \\ln^2 x}\\, \\mathrm{d}x$$  \nand determine if an elementary proof exists.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Is there an elementary proof?\" So the problem is to prove the identity and address the existence of an elementary proof. Therefore, the problem statement should include both aspects.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nThe integral is taken over the interval [0, ∞),\nΓ(x) denotes the gamma function.\nProblem: \nProve that  \n$$\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x = e + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{\\pi^2 + \\ln^2 x}\\, \\mathrm{d}x$$  \nand determine if there exists an elementary proof.\n###",
