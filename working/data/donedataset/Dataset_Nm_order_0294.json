    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The question is whether the sum of two square roots, √n + √m, can be a rational number if neither n nor m are perfect squares. Both n and m are natural numbers here. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that they don't think it's possible, and their intuition is that if √m were equal to a rational number minus √n, then somehow this would lead to a contradiction. But they need help formalizing this proof.\n\nLet me start by assuming that √n + √m is rational. Let's call this sum 'a', so √n + √m = a, where a is a rational number. Then, rearranging this equation, we get √m = a - √n. If I square both sides of this equation, maybe I can find a contradiction.\n\nSquaring both sides gives m = (a - √n)^2 = a² - 2a√n + n. Rearranging terms, we get m - a² - n = -2a√n. Then, solving for √n, we have √n = (a² + n - m)/(2a). \n\nWait, but the left side of the equation, √n, is either irrational or an integer. However, since n is not a perfect square, √n must be irrational. The right side is (a² + n - m)/(2a). For this to be rational, since a is rational, the numerator and denominator are both rational, so the entire expression is rational. Therefore, √n would have to be rational, which contradicts the assumption that n is not a perfect square. \n\nBut hold on, this seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a step I missed. Let's check again. If a is rational, then a² is also rational. n and m are integers, so (a² + n - m) is rational, and 2a is rational (and non-zero if a ≠ 0, which it isn't since both √n and √m are non-negative). So √n is expressed as a rational number, which would imply that √n is rational, hence n is a perfect square. But that contradicts the assumption that n is not a perfect square. Therefore, our initial assumption that √n + √m is rational must be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where both √n and √m are irrational, but their sum is rational. For example, take √2 and 1 - √2. Their sum is 1, which is rational, but in this case, 1 - √2 is negative, which can't be since m is a natural number and √m must be non-negative. So such a case isn't possible here.\n\nAnother angle: suppose both √n and √m are irrational, but their sum is rational. Let's denote the sum as a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors. Then, as before, squaring gives n + m + 2√(nm) = (a²)/(b²). Rearranging, 2√(nm) = (a²)/(b²) - n - m. The left side is irrational unless nm is a perfect square. But if nm is a perfect square, then since neither n nor m is a perfect square individually, they must share some factors that make their product a square. For example, n = 2 and m = 8: neither is a perfect square, but their product is 16, which is a square. Then √2 + √8 = √2 + 2√2 = 3√2, which is irrational. Wait, but in that case, the sum is still irrational. So even if nm is a perfect square, the sum might not be rational. \n\nWait, let's take another example where nm is a square. Let n = 3 and m = 12, so nm = 36. Then √3 + √12 = √3 + 2√3 = 3√3, which is irrational. So even if nm is a square, the sum is a multiple of a single square root, so it's still irrational. Therefore, if nm is a square, then √n + √m = k√p for some integer k and square-free p, which is irrational unless k=0, which isn't possible here.\n\nAlternatively, if nm is not a square, then √(nm) is irrational, so the equation 2√(nm) = (a²)/(b²) - n - m would imply that a rational number equals an irrational number, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that nm is a perfect square. But even if nm is a perfect square, we saw that the sum is still irrational. Therefore, there's no case where √n + √m is rational unless one of n or m is a perfect square. Wait, but let's check if both n and m are squares. If they are, then their sum is rational. But the problem states that neither is a perfect square. So the conclusion is that the sum cannot be rational.\n\nWait, but what if one of them is a square? For example, if n is a square and m isn't, then √n is rational, and √m is irrational, so their sum is irrational. Similarly, if both are squares, the sum could be rational, like √4 + √9 = 2 + 3 = 5. But the problem excludes that case by stating neither is a square. So the answer should be no, it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that if n and m are natural numbers and neither is a perfect square, then √n + √m is irrational.",
