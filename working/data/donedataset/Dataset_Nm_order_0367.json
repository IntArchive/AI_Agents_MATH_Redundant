    "Content": "The well known and intuitive pigeonhole principle states that if $n$ items are put in $m$ containers, and $n>m$, then there is  at least one container which has more than one object. I've always relied on this principle when solving combinatorics problems for the mathematical olympiads, where a high level of formalization is not necessary, but recently I've seen it in a group theory proof, so I wonder: is there a mathematically formal and rigorous formulation of this principle and, if so, what is its proof?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes and no. A fairly precise statement of the pigeonhole principle would be: If $A$ and $B$ are sets, and $A$ has more elements than $B$, and $f$ is a function $A\\to B$, then $f$ is not injective. Can it be proved? That depends. In particular, what does \"$A$ has more elements than $B$\" mean? In the usual development of set theory we use this phrase to mean the same as \"$A$ has larger cardinality than $B$\", which again means There is an injective function $B\\to A$, but there is no injective function $A\\to B$. So if we use that as our definition, the pigeonhole principle is not a matter of proof -- instead it is part of the definition of what it means for one set to be larger than the other. Of course, once we define natural numbers, we might want to prove a \"finite pigeonhole principle\": If $m$ and $n$ are naturals, and $m>n$, and $A$ has $m$ elements and $B$ has $n$ elements, and $f$ is a function $A\\to B$, then $f$ is not injective. Then all we have to do is to prove this from a definitions of \"has $m$ elements\" and \"$m<n$\". The first of these is fairly easily done, because in the usual development, the natural number $m$ is represented by the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\}$ and \"has $m$ elements\" means to be in bijective correspondence by precisely that set. So when we strip away those bijections, what we have to prove is that if $m>n$ and $f:m\\to n$, then $f$ is not injective. This would be trivial (and pointless) if we're using the cardinality definition of what $m>n$ means -- so even though that is the most common choice, let's assume that we want to define $m>n$ to mean \"there is a natural $a$ such that $n+a+1=m$. The actual content of the proof now is to show that these two competing definitions of $>$ agree! Of course we first need to define addition, but once we have done that, it is a fairly simple matter of induction. First we prove that $|m+1|>|m|$ (as cardinals) for all $m$. The base case $m=0$ is easy. $0$ is the empty set, so there is no function for $1\\to 0$ at all, so in the impossible case that we get one, we can safely claim it will be non-injective. For the induction case, assume that $|m+1|>|m|$ and we need to show that $|m+1+1|>|m+1|$. Let $f: (m+1+1)\\to(m+1)$ be given, and let $b=f(m+1)$ $$g:(m+1)\\to m : x \\mapsto\\begin{cases}f(x) & \\text{when }f(x)\\ne m \\\\ b & \\text{when }f(x)=m \\end{cases}$$ Then by the induction hypothesis $g$ is not injective, so there is $p$ and $q$ with $g(p)=g(q)$. If $f(p)=f(q)$ then $f$ is not injective, and we're done. Otherwise $f(p)\\ne f(q)$, but this can only be the case if one of them is $m$ and the other is $b$. But then either $f(p)$ or $f(q)$ equals $f(m+1)$, and $f$ is again not injective. Now to complete the proof, we just have to handle the case where $a\\ne 0$ in $|m+a+1|>|m+1|$. By this time we hopefully know that addition is commutative and associative, so $m+a+1=m+1+a$. And so if we have $f:(m+a+1)\\to (m+1)$, then it is also $((m+1)+a)\\to(m+1)$, and its restriction to $(m+1)$ is not injective. A restriction of an injective function would itself be injective, so $f$ is not injective. (Whew!). (... except that we also ought to prove along the way that $p+a\\subseteq p$ with the standard representation of the natural numbers; otherwise restricting the last $f$ to $(m+a)$ doesn't make sense). For a third option, we could also have said that $m>n$ means that $n\\in m$ for the set representation of the numbers. That would need a different proof from the induction above. But all in all, these proofs are not very enlightening about the pigeonhole principle . Intuitively I would say that the pigeonhole principle is itself at least as obvious as it is that $n+a+1=m$ is a good definition of $m>n$. So what the proof actually proves could be argued to be just that the $n+a+1$ definition is reasonable. And this would also be the case for the $n\\in m$ alternative.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's start by looking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking about the rigorous formulation and proof of the pigeonhole principle. They mention that while they've used it in combinatorics problems, they now see it in a group theory proof and want a formal treatment. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions in the problem. The pigeonhole principle, as stated, says that if n items are put into m containers and n > m, then at least one container has more than one item. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. There are n items.\n2. There are m containers.\n3. The number of items n is greater than the number of containers m.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition applied to different objects (items and containers). The problem then is to prove that under these conditions, at least one container must contain more than one item. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user also mentions using it in group theory, but the core principle here is purely combinatorial. So the formulation should stay within set theory or combinatorics, not group theory, unless the group theory context adds specific conditions, but the question seems to be about the general principle.\n\nWait, the example provided in the initial format included an assumption about divisibility by 7. Here, the key assumptions are just the numbers n and m and the inequality. There's no additional condition like specific values or structures unless the user is implying a different version. But the original statement is general: n items, m containers, n > m. So the assumptions are straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list those three assumptions and the problem statement to prove the existence of a container with more than one item. Let me check the example again to ensure the format is correct. In the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, each assumption is about the number of items, containers, and their relationship. That fits.\n\nI don't see any other conditions mentioned in the question. The user wants a formal proof, but the problem structure doesn't require proof steps here—just the formatted problem. So the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: \nn items are put into m containers,\nn is an integer greater than m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that at least one container has more than one object.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user wrote \"if n items are put in m containers, and n > m, then...\" So maybe split the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\nn and m are integers,\nn items are put into m containers,\nn > m.\n\nBut the example given in the initial format had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So following that, each assumption line addresses one property. So here, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nn and m are integers,\nn items are distributed into m containers,\nn is greater than m.\n\nBut the original problem statement doesn't explicitly state that n and m are integers, but given the context (combinatorics, number of items), they must be positive integers. However, since the question is about rigor, we need to state all assumptions. The user's original problem statement says \"if n items...\", so the number of items and containers are positive integers. Therefore, the assumptions should include that n and m are positive integers. Wait, but in the example, the assumption was just \"n is an integer\". So maybe here, the first assumption is \"n and m are positive integers\", the second is \"n items are put into m containers\", and the third is \"n > m\". Each on a separate line.\n\nAlternatively, the user might not have specified positivity, but in the pigeonhole principle, typically n and m are positive integers. However, to be precise, the problem as stated by the user just mentions \"n items\" and \"m containers\", which implies n and m are positive integers. But for rigor, we should make that explicit. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n and m are positive integers.\n2. n items are placed into m containers.\n3. n > m.\n\nThen the problem is to prove at least one container has more than one object. However, in the user's original question, the problem statement is as given. The example given in the initial format includes the divisibility condition as a separate assumption, even though the original problem statement didn't mention it. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no—the example seems to have a mistake. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a bad example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That might be an error in the example. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is incorrect, but following their structure, even if the assumptions are not in the original problem. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user realized that it's necessary to assume n is divisible by 7? No, the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is wrong. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to format the pigeonhole principle question according to their example.\n\nIn the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in that case, the formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. But that seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the user's example is flawed. But given that, I should follow the instruction to structure the problem as in the example, extracting assumptions from the problem statement.\n\nSo in the pigeonhole case, the original problem states \"if n items are put in m containers, and n > m\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- n items are put into m containers.\n- n > m.\n\nBut in the example, they split \"n is an integer\" and another condition. So perhaps here, we need to list:\n\nAssumption:\nn and m are integers,\nn items are put into m containers,\nn > m.\n\nBecause the problem statement implies n and m are integers (since you can't have a fraction of an item or container). Therefore, each line is one assumption. The problem is to prove that at least one container has more than one object.\n\nSo putting it all together, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn and m are integers,\nn items are distributed into m containers,\nn is greater than m.\n\nProblem:\nProve that at least one container contains more than one object.",
