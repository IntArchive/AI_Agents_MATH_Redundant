    "Content": "Similar to a previous question here , I wonder if cyclic permutations are the only relations amongst traces of (non-commutative) monomials.  Since the evaluations $\\operatorname{tr}:k\\langle x,y,\\dots \\rangle \\to k$ take an infinite dimensional vector space to a one-dimensional vector space there must be quite a few relations, but I wonder if any of them are on binomials other than the cyclic permutations. At any rate, for small dimensions, we probably get some extra relations. It appears that $\\operatorname{tr}(AABABB−AABBAB) = 0$ for all $2×2$ matrices.  Is this true?  How does one prove it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "First if $N$ is $2\\times2$ matrix with $\\operatorname{tr}(N)=0$, then $N^2$ is scalar (either $N$ is nilpotent or its eigenvalues are opposite and have same square). This implies that $\\operatorname{tr}(N^3)=0$. And \n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n(AB-BA)^3 &=& (ABABAB - BABABA) + (ABBABA + BABAAB + BAABBA) \\\\\n && - (ABABBA + ABBAAB + BAABAB)\n\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$ taking the trace this gives $$0 = 0 + 3\\operatorname{tr}(ABBABA) - 3 \\operatorname{tr}(ABABBA) = 3 \\operatorname{tr}(AABBAB - AABABB).$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the trace of AABABB minus the trace of AABBAB is always zero for any 2x2 matrices A and B. They also want to know how to prove it. \n\nFirst, I remember that the trace of a matrix has some properties, like trace is invariant under cyclic permutations. So, for example, tr(ABC) = tr(BCA) = tr(CAB). But in this case, the two expressions AABABB and AABBAB aren't cyclic permutations of each other. Let me check:\n\nAABABB is A*A*B*A*B*B\nAABBAB is A*A*B*B*A*B\n\nLooking at the order, they both have four A's and two B's, but arranged differently. The first has A, A, B, A, B, B and the second has A, A, B, B, A, B. So the difference is in the placement of the B's. The fifth and sixth positions in the first are B, B, whereas in the second, the fifth is A and sixth is B. \n\nSince cyclic permutations would only rotate the order, but here the order is changed non-cyclically. However, the user suggests that despite this, the traces might be equal for 2x2 matrices. So maybe there's a relation specific to 2x2 matrices that allows this identity.\n\nI recall that for 2x2 matrices, there are certain trace identities that don't hold in higher dimensions. For example, the trace of any commutator [A,B] = AB - BA is zero, but in 2x2 matrices, there might be more relations because the characteristic polynomial is quadratic, leading to relations via the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.\n\nCayley-Hamilton says that every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. For a 2x2 matrix M, this would be M² - tr(M)M + det(M)I = 0. Maybe this can be used to reduce the length of the monomials in the trace expression.\n\nBut the monomials here are of length 6. That seems complicated. However, perhaps we can express higher powers in terms of traces and determinants. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in 2x2 matrices, any three-fold product can be expressed in terms of lower-degree terms. Wait, maybe not directly. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that for 2x2 matrices, the trace of a product of matrices can be expressed in terms of traces of shorter products. For example, tr(ABAB) can be related to tr(A)tr(B)tr(AB) and so on. But I need to recall the exact identities.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about the difference of two traces, tr(AABABB) - tr(AABBAB), maybe expanding both expressions and showing that all terms cancel out. However, expanding such products directly would be messy. Let's see if there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: use the cyclic property of trace to rearrange terms. For example, tr(AABABB) = tr(B AABAB) = tr(AB AAB B), but I'm not sure if that helps. Let's try to apply cyclic permutations to both terms and see if they can be made similar.\n\nWait, let's write AABABB as (A^2 B)(AB B) and AABBAB as (A^2 B)(B A B). Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, write them as A*A*B*A*B*B and A*A*B*B*A*B. Let's denote the first as A^2 B A B^2 and the second as A^2 B^2 A B. \n\nIf I can express both in terms that can be compared via cyclic permutations or other trace properties. Alternatively, maybe express one in terms of the other plus some commutators, whose traces are zero. For example, the difference between AABABB and AABBAB could involve commutators of A and B. However, the trace of a commutator is zero, but the product of commutators might not be. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the difference AABABB - AABBAB. If we factor this expression, maybe we can write it as A^2 B (A B^2 - B^2 A). Then, the trace would be tr(A^2 B (A B^2 - B^2 A)). But the term inside the parentheses is A B^2 - B^2 A = [A, B^2]. So, the trace becomes tr(A^2 B [A, B^2]). However, since trace is linear, this is tr(A^2 B A B^2) - tr(A^2 B B^2 A). But then, tr(A^2 B B^2 A) = tr(A^3 B^3), by cycling the last A to the front? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\ntr(A^2 B B^2 A) = tr(A^2 B^3 A) = tr(A^3 B^3) if we cycle the last A to the front, but that's only valid for cyclic permutations. Wait, tr(XY) = tr(YX), so tr(A^2 B^3 A) = tr(A A^2 B^3) = tr(A^3 B^3). Wait, is that right? Let me verify:\n\nSuppose X = A^2 B^3 and Y = A. Then tr(XY) = tr(A^2 B^3 A) = tr(YX) = tr(A A^2 B^3) = tr(A^3 B^3). So yes, tr(A^2 B^3 A) = tr(A^3 B^3). Therefore, the difference tr(AABABB) - tr(AABBAB) becomes tr(A^2 B A B^2) - tr(A^3 B^3). But maybe this isn't helpful. Wait, unless there's a relation between A^2 B A B^2 and A^3 B^3 in terms of trace.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. For 2x2 matrices A and B, we can express higher powers in terms of lower powers. For example, A² = tr(A)A - det(A)I, and similarly for B. But even with that, substituting into the product AABABB might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me try expanding A² using Cayley-Hamilton: A² = tr(A) A - det(A) I. Similarly, B² = tr(B) B - det(B) I. But in the product AABABB, we have A², B², etc. Wait, AABABB is A*A*B*A*B*B. So maybe replace each A² with tr(A)A - det(A)I and each B² with tr(B)B - det(B)I. But this substitution might break the product structure. Let's see.\n\nFirst, replacing the first A² in AABABB: A*A becomes tr(A) A - det(A) I. Then the expression becomes [tr(A) A - det(A) I] * B * A * B². Hmm, but this introduces a term with I, which when multiplied by B becomes B. So, expanding, we have tr(A) A B A B² - det(A) B A B². Similarly, the B² can be replaced by tr(B) B - det(B) I. So, let's do that for the last B² in the term:\n\nSo, the term tr(A) A B A [tr(B) B - det(B) I] - det(A) B A [tr(B) B - det(B) I].\n\nExpanding further, we get tr(A)tr(B) A B A B - tr(A)det(B) A B A - det(A)tr(B) B A B + det(A)det(B) B A.\n\nSimilarly, for the other term AABBAB, which is A*A*B*B*A*B. Following the same steps, replacing A² with tr(A)A - det(A)I and B² with tr(B)B - det(B)I.\n\nFirst, A*A becomes tr(A)A - det(A)I, so [tr(A)A - det(A)I] * B² * A * B.\n\nThen replacing B² with tr(B)B - det(B)I, we get [tr(A)A - det(A)I][tr(B)B - det(B)I] A B.\n\nExpanding this would give:\n\ntr(A)tr(B) A B A B - tr(A)det(B) A A B - det(A)tr(B) B A B + det(A)det(B) I A B.\n\nWait, but this seems messy. Let me compare the two expanded forms.\n\nFor the first term (AABABB) expansion:\n\ntr(A)tr(B) A B A B - tr(A)det(B) A B A - det(A)tr(B) B A B + det(A)det(B) B A.\n\nFor the second term (AABBAB) expansion:\n\ntr(A)tr(B) A B A B - tr(A)det(B) A A B - det(A)tr(B) B A B + det(A)det(B) I A B.\n\nNow, subtracting the two expansions: tr(AABABB) - tr(AABBAB) would be the trace of the difference of the two expressions. Let's compute the difference term by term.\n\nFirst, the tr(A)tr(B) A B A B term cancels out in both. Then, the next terms: - tr(A)det(B) A B A (from first) and - (- tr(A)det(B) A A B) from the second. Wait, no, the second term in the second expansion is - tr(A)det(B) A A B. So when subtracting, it's [ - tr(A)det(B) A B A ] - [ - tr(A)det(B) A A B ] = - tr(A)det(B) (A B A - A A B).\n\nSimilarly, the next terms: - det(A)tr(B) B A B from both, so they cancel. Then, the last terms: det(A)det(B) B A - det(A)det(B) I A B. So that's det(A)det(B) (B A - I A B).\n\nTherefore, the difference is:\n\n- tr(A)det(B) (A B A - A A B) + det(A)det(B) (B A - A B).\n\nTaking the trace of this difference. Since trace is linear, we can write:\n\ntr( difference ) = - tr(A)det(B) tr(A B A - A A B) + det(A)det(B) tr(B A - A B).\n\nBut note that tr(B A - A B) = tr(B A) - tr(A B) = 0 because trace is invariant under cyclic permutations; tr(A B) = tr(B A). Similarly, tr(A B A - A A B) = tr(A B A) - tr(A A B). Let's see:\n\ntr(A B A) = tr(A^2 B) by cycling the first A to the end: A B A → B A A = B A². Then tr(A B A) = tr(B A²). Similarly, tr(A A B) = tr(A² B). So the difference tr(A B A) - tr(A² B) = tr(B A²) - tr(A² B) = 0, since tr(B A²) = tr(A² B). Therefore, the first term involving tr(A)det(B) also vanishes. \n\nThus, the entire trace difference is zero. Therefore, tr(AABABB) - tr(AABBAB) = 0 for any 2x2 matrices A and B. Hence, the identity holds.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For 2x2 matrices, any trace of a product longer than 3 can be reduced using Cayley-Hamilton, but in this case, the difference ends up being a combination of traces of commutators and other terms that individually vanish or cancel out. Hence, the trace difference is zero.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that yes, the trace of AABABB equals the trace of AABBAB for all 2x2 matrices, and the proof relies on expanding the products using Cayley-Hamilton (or properties of trace and commutators) and showing that the difference's trace is zero.",
