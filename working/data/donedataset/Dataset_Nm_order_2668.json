    "Content": "Let $x_0, x_1$ be positive numbers and define $$x_{n+2}=x_{n+1}+\\frac{1}{x_n + \\sqrt{n}}$$ Prove that the sequence $y_n = x_n / \\sqrt{n} \\to 1 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\$. My attempt: I think it would suffice to consider the inequalities $x_n < \\sqrt{n}$ and $x_n > \\sqrt{n}$. From the given recursion, we would then extract $$x_{n+2} - x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{x_n + \\sqrt{n}} > \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}$$ (flip the inequality in the other case) and compute $y_n$ from this. But the issue here is that I can't find the necessary limit in both cases.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question: The sequence is defined by x₀ and x₁ being positive numbers, and the recursion x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n). The goal is to prove that y_n = x_n / √n tends to 1 as n approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n\n1. x₀ is a positive number. (Given as \"positive numbers\" for x₀ and x₁, so each should be a separate assumption.)\n2. x₁ is a positive number.\n3. The sequence is defined by the recursion x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n) for all n ≥ 0. (This is the recursive formula provided.)\n4. The problem is to prove that the limit of y_n = x_n / √n as n approaches infinity is 1.\n\nWait, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the recursion involves √n, which implies n is a non-negative integer (since the sequence starts at x₀). But the user didn't specify that n is an integer, but since it's a sequence, n is typically an index, so it's a non-negative integer. However, in the original problem statement, maybe it's better to note that n is a non-negative integer? But the original problem says \"positive numbers\" for x₀ and x₁, so they are initial terms.\n\nThe problem mentions that x₀ and x₁ are positive numbers. The recursion is for n ≥ 0, so each term is defined based on previous terms. Therefore, the assumptions should list that x₀ and x₁ are positive, and the recursion formula. The problem is to show that y_n = x_n / √n approaches 1.\n\nWait, the original problem statement in the question says \"Prove that the sequence y_n = x_n / sqrt(n) tends to 1\". So the problem is to prove the limit is 1. The assumptions are x₀ and x₁ are positive, and the recursion formula. Do I need to list any other assumptions? For example, n is a non-negative integer? Since sequences are typically defined for integers n ≥ 0, but the problem statement mentions \"positive numbers\" for x₀ and x₁, which are the starting points, so n would start from 0 upwards. But maybe in the assumptions, the user wants to list all conditions on the objects. So each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: x₀ is a positive real number.\n\nAssumption 2: x₁ is a positive real number.\n\nAssumption 3: For each non-negative integer n, the sequence is defined by x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n).\n\nBut wait, the original recursion is given as x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n). So the recursion uses the term x_n and √n. Therefore, for each n ≥ 0, x_{n+2} is defined in terms of x_{n+1} and x_n. So the third assumption is the recursive definition for all n ≥ 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of y_n = x_n / √n as n approaches infinity is 1.\n\nBut the example given in the user's instruction had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about a sequence, so n is naturally an integer starting from 0. But in the problem statement, does the user mention anything about n's divisibility or other properties? The original problem doesn't, so maybe the only assumptions are the initial terms being positive and the recursion formula. The problem is to prove the limit.\n\nWait, the problem in the example included an assumption that was in the original problem but not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Because if the original problem is to prove for every integer n, then the assumption should not have \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem had a different condition. Wait, maybe I need to check. Let me re-read the example.\n\nIn the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the user wants to split the original problem's conditions into assumptions. For example, if the problem had said \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", then the assumption would be that. But in the given example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\". That must be a mistake. Perhaps the example is flawed, but the user provided it as an example, so we need to follow the structure as per their example, even if it's incorrect.\n\nIn any case, returning to the current problem. The original problem says: Let x₀, x₁ be positive numbers and define x_{n+2}=x_{n+1} +1/(x_n +√n). Prove that y_n = x_n /√n →1.\n\nSo, following the example's structure, we list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption 1: x₀ is a positive real number.\n\nAssumption 2: x₁ is a positive real number.\n\nAssumption 3: For each non-negative integer n, the sequence is defined by x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the sequence y_n = x_n / √n converges to 1 as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions included conditions on n. But in this problem, the recursion involves √n, which is defined for n ≥0. However, the original problem doesn't specify any restriction on n beyond being a non-negative integer (since it's a sequence). So maybe we don't need to state that n is an integer, because it's implied by the sequence definition. However, in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, following that example, perhaps we need to include \"n is a non-negative integer\" as an assumption.\n\nBut the problem defines x_{n+2} in terms of x_n and x_{n+1}, so n is an index here. Therefore, n is a non-negative integer. However, the original problem didn't state this explicitly, but in the context of sequences, it's standard. But according to the example, the user wants to list even such standard assumptions. So maybe we need to include that n is a non-negative integer. However, the problem statement says \"Let x₀, x₁ be positive numbers and define x_{n+2} = ...\". Here, the indices n+2, n+1, n imply that n is an integer. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to list that n is a non-negative integer. But in the problem statement, is that given? The problem states \"Let x₀, x₁ be positive numbers and define...\", so the recursion is for all n where the terms are defined. Since x₀ and x₁ are given, then x₂ is defined when n=0, x₃ when n=1, etc. Therefore, n is a non-negative integer starting from 0. So maybe we should include that as an assumption.\n\nBut the example given by the user added assumptions not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. But perhaps the example was mistyped, and the actual original problem had that condition. However, given that, perhaps the user's instruction is to list all conditions, even if they're part of the problem's standard setup. So for this problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. x₀ is a positive real number.\n\n2. x₁ is a positive real number.\n\n3. For each non-negative integer n, the sequence is defined by x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 1/(x_n + √n).\n\nProblem: Prove that the limit of y_n = x_n / √n as n approaches infinity is 1.\n\nBut the original problem says \"positive numbers\", so x₀ and x₁ are positive, which is two separate assumptions. Then the recursion formula. The problem is as stated.\n\nTherefore, that's how I should format it.",
