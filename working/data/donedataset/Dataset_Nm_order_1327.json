    "Content": "I found this amazingly beautiful identity here . How to prove that $A^3+B^3+C^3 - 3ABC = (A+B+C)(A+B\\omega+C\\omega^2)(A+B\\omega^2+C\\omega)$ without directly multiplying the factors? (I've already verified it that way). Moreover, how could someone possibly find such a factorization using complex numbers? Is it possible to find such a factorization because $A^3+B^3+C^3 - 3ABC$ is a symmetric polynomial in $A,B,C$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "We know $(A+B)\\mid(A^n+B^n)$ for $n$ odd. What about with three terms? Compute $$\\mod A+B+C:\\quad A^3+B^3+C^3\\equiv-(B+C)^3+B^3+C^3\\equiv-3BC(B+C)\\equiv 3ABC.$$ So $(A+B+C)\\mid(A^3+B^3+C^3-3ABC)=f(A,B,C)$. Further $$f(A,B,C)=f(A,\\omega B,\\bar{\\omega}C)=f(A,\\bar{\\omega}B,\\omega C)=\\rm etc.$$ by inspection so both $A+\\omega B+\\bar{\\omega}C$ and $A+\\bar{\\omega}B+\\omega C$ are also factors. This argument exploits divisibility properties and inherent symmetry. It is generalized by the first proof (using matrix operations) mentioned in my other answer to compute $\\Phi(G)$ for $G$ abelian.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove the identity A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC = (A + B + C)(A + Bω + Cω²)(A + Bω² + Cω) without directly multiplying the factors. They also mentioned using complex numbers and the fact that it's a symmetric polynomial. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what ω is. I think ω is a primitive cube root of unity, so ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1. That means ω² + ω + 1 = 0, which might be useful. Since the polynomial is symmetric, maybe factoring using symmetry or some substitution could help.\n\nThe left side is a cubic polynomial symmetric in A, B, C. The right side is a product of three linear terms. The first factor is (A + B + C), which is symmetric. The other two factors involve ω, so they might be related to the roots of the equation x³ - 1 = 0. \n\nMaybe if we consider the polynomial A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC and try to factor it. I remember that A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC can be factored as (A + B + C)(A² + B² + C² - AB - BC - CA). But here, the given factorization is different; instead of quadratic terms, it's product of three linear terms involving ω. \n\nWait, perhaps if we consider the identity for the sum of cubes when variables are multiplied by roots of unity. Let me think: If we let variables take values multiplied by ω, maybe we can get the factors. Alternatively, since ω² is also a root, maybe substituting A, B, C with Aω, Bω², etc., could lead to something.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we treat the polynomial as a cubic in one variable, say A, and see if the factors correspond to roots. Let's fix B and C and consider the equation A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC = 0. If we can find roots for A, then the factors would be (A - root1)(A - root2)(A - root3). But the given factorization isn't in terms of A alone but includes B and C. \n\nWait, the given factorization has three linear terms: (A + B + C), (A + Bω + Cω²), and (A + Bω² + Cω). If we think of ω as a cube root of unity, maybe these are related to cyclic permutations with ω. For example, when you multiply out (A + B + C)(A + Bω + Cω²)(A + Bω² + Cω), each term might involve combinations where the exponents of ω sum to a multiple of 3, hence collapsing to real terms. \n\nBut how to get there without expanding? Maybe use properties of determinants or eigenvalues? Or perhaps note that the left-hand side is the determinant of a certain matrix. Wait, A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC is the determinant of a circulant matrix? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the identity related to complex numbers. Since ω is a cube root of unity, maybe we can use substitution. Let me consider that if x³ + y³ + z³ - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x + yω + zω²)(x + yω² + zω). If I set x = A, y = B, z = C, then that's exactly the identity. But how to prove this without expanding?\n\nPerhaps using the fact that the polynomial is symmetric and of degree 3, so if we can show that both sides have the same roots, then they must be proportional. Then check the leading coefficient to confirm equality. \n\nSuppose we consider the right-hand side as a product of three linear factors. Each factor is linear in A, B, C. The left-hand side is a cubic polynomial. If we can show that when any of the factors on the right is zero, the left-hand side is also zero, then the right-hand side divides the left-hand side. Since both are degree 3, they would be scalar multiples of each other. Then check the coefficient to see if they are equal.\n\nFor example, suppose A + B + C = 0. Then the left-hand side becomes A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC. But when A + B + C = 0, we know that A³ + B³ + C³ = 3ABC, so the left-hand side is zero. Similarly, if A + Bω + Cω² = 0, then substituting A = -Bω - Cω² into the left-hand side should give zero. Let me check that.\n\nLet A = -Bω - Cω². Substitute into A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC:\n\nCompute A³ = (-Bω - Cω²)³. Expand this:\n\n= - (Bω + Cω²)³ \n= - [ B³ω³ + 3B²Cω²*ω² + 3BC²ω*(ω²)² + C³(ω²)^3 ]\nWait, maybe using binomial theorem. Alternatively, since ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1, ω⁴ = ω, etc.\n\nAlternatively, compute (-Bω - Cω²)³. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, (-Bω - Cω²)³ = - (Bω + Cω²)³. Let’s compute (Bω + Cω²)³:\n\nUsing (x + y)^3 = x³ + 3x²y + 3xy² + y³.\n\nSo, (Bω)^3 + 3(Bω)^2(Cω²) + 3(Bω)(Cω²)^2 + (Cω²)^3.\n\n= B³ω³ + 3B²C ω²*ω² + 3BC² ω*(ω^4) + C³ ω^6.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nω³ = 1, ω^4 = ω (since ω^3 = 1, so ω^4 = ω), ω^6 = (ω^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n\nSo:\n\n= B³(1) + 3B²C ω^(2+2) + 3BC² ω^(1 + 4) + C³(1)\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let's correct the exponents step by step.\n\nFirst term: (Bω)^3 = B³ ω³ = B³ * 1 = B³.\n\nSecond term: 3*(Bω)^2*(Cω²) = 3B²C ω² * ω² = 3B²C ω^{4} = 3B²C ω (since ω^3=1, so ω^4=ω).\n\nThird term: 3*(Bω)*(Cω²)^2 = 3B C² ω*(ω^4) = 3B C² ω*ω = 3B C² ω² (since ω^4=ω, then ω^4*ω=ω^5=ω²).\n\nFourth term: (Cω²)^3 = C³ ω^{6} = C³ (ω^3)^2 = C³ *1^2= C³.\n\nSo altogether:\n\n= B³ + 3B²C ω + 3B C² ω² + C³.\n\nTherefore, (Bω + Cω²)^3 = B³ + C³ + 3B²C ω + 3B C² ω².\n\nThus, A³ = - (B³ + C³ + 3B²C ω + 3B C² ω²).\n\nNow, substitute A = -Bω - Cω² into the left-hand side A³ + B³ + C³ - 3ABC:\n\nLeft-hand side becomes:\n\n[- (B³ + C³ + 3B²C ω + 3B C² ω²)] + B³ + C³ - 3*(-Bω - Cω²)*B*C.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: -B³ - C³ -3B²C ω -3BC² ω²\n\nSecond term: +B³ + C³\n\nThird term: -3*(-BωBC - Cω²BC) = -3*(-B²C ω - BC² ω²) = +3B²C ω + 3BC² ω²\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n(-B³ - C³ -3B²C ω -3BC² ω²) + (B³ + C³) + (3B²C ω + 3BC² ω²)\n\nThe -B³ and +B³ cancel, same with -C³ and +C³. The -3B²C ω and +3B²C ω cancel, same with -3BC² ω² and +3BC² ω². So total is 0. Therefore, when A + Bω + Cω² = 0, the left-hand side is zero. Similarly, if A + Bω² + Cω = 0, substituting would also lead to zero.\n\nTherefore, the three factors (A + B + C), (A + Bω + Cω²), (A + Bω² + Cω) each divide the left-hand side polynomial. Since all three are linear and distinct, their product divides the left-hand side. Since both sides are degree 3 in A, B, C, the left-hand side must be a constant multiple of the product. Comparing coefficients, for example, the coefficient of A³ on the left is 1, and on the right, the product would have coefficient 1*1*1 = 1. Hence, the constant multiple is 1. Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nAs for how someone could find this factorization using complex numbers, the key is recognizing that the polynomial is symmetric and that cube roots of unity can be used to factor symmetric cubic expressions. Since ω and ω² are roots of x² + x + 1 = 0, which comes from x³ - 1 = (x -1)(x² + x + 1), using these roots allows the factorization into linear terms involving ω. The symmetry suggests that the factors might involve symmetric combinations with roots of unity to maintain the symmetry in a cyclic manner.",
