    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully.\n\nThe user provided the title and the question. The title says, \"Prime ideals are maximal if all $r$ satisfy $\\,r^{n_r} = r$ for some $n_r > 1\". The question itself is from Atiyah and MacDonald's book, Chapter 1, Exercise 7. The task is to show that any prime ideal in such a ring is maximal.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that R is a commutative ring with identity. That's one assumption. Then, for every element r in R, there exists an integer n > 1 such that r^n = r. That's another assumption. The problem then asks to show that any prime ideal in R is maximal. \n\nWait, but in the example provided, the assumption included both the ring being commutative with identity and the condition on each element. However, in the example, the user separated the conditions. For instance, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, similarly, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. R is a commutative ring.\n2. R has an identity element.\n3. For every element r in R, there exists an integer n > 1 such that r^n = r.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to R. Then the problem is to show that any prime ideal in R is maximal.\n\nLet me check the original problem again. The problem says \"Let R be a commutative ring with an identity such that for all r ∈ R, there exists some n > 1 such that r^n = r. Show that any prime ideal is maximal.\" So the ring is commutative, has an identity, and each element satisfies r^n = r for some n > 1. These should be three separate assumptions. The problem is to show prime ideals are maximal.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nR is a commutative ring,\nR has an identity element,\nFor each element r in R, there exists an integer n_r > 1 such that r^{n_r} = r.\n\nProblem:\nShow that any prime ideal of R is maximal.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line and addresses one property. The commutative property, existence of identity, and the condition on each element. That's three assumptions. The problem is to show prime ideals are maximal. That should fit the required format.",
