    "Content": "I was playing with recursively defined sequences, and stumbled upon a curious apparent result. Let $u_1=\\frac1N$ , where $N\\in\\mathbb{Z^+}$ , and $u_n=u_{n-1}+(u_{n-1})^2$ . Let $f(N)=$ number of terms in the sequence $\\{u_n\\}$ that are less than $1$ . I used Excel to find that: $f(2)=2$ $f(10)=12$ $f(100)=104$ $f(1000)=1006$ $f(10000)=10008$ $f(100000)=100011$ So it seems that the number of number of terms less than $1$ , is approximately $N$ . Why? To put this more precisely, Prove that $\\lim\\limits_{N\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(N)}{N}=1$ . My attempt I found a question called \"What's known about recurrences involving $(a_n)^2$ ?\", which led me to the concept of quadratic map , but these did not help me. I found the sequence A122888 (a large list is here ), which gives the coefficients of $x^k$ in the $n$ th iteration of $x+x^2$ . So for example, terms $a_7$ to $a_{14}$ are $\\color{red}{1,3,6,9,10,8,4,1}$ . This tells us that, in my original sequence, $u_4=\\color{red}{1}(u_1)^1+\\color{red}{3}(u_1)^2+\\color{red}{6}(u_1)^3+\\color{red}{9}(u_1)^4+\\color{red}{10}(u_1)^5+\\color{red}{8}(u_1)^6+\\color{red}{4}(u_1)^7+\\color{red}{1}(u_1)^8$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to prove that the limit of f(N)/N as N approaches infinity is 1, where f(N) is the number of terms in the sequence {u_n} that are less than 1. The sequence is defined recursively with u_1 = 1/N and u_n = u_{n-1} + (u_{n-1})^2. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the behavior of the sequence. Let's start by writing out the first few terms for a specific N, say N=2, to see the pattern. \n\nFor N=2:\nu1 = 1/2 = 0.5\nu2 = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75\nu3 = 0.75 + 0.75^2 = 0.75 + 0.5625 = 1.3125\nSo f(2) = 2 (u1 and u2 are less than 1).\n\nSimilarly, for N=10:\nu1 = 0.1\nu2 = 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.11\nu3 = 0.11 + 0.0121 = 0.1221\n...\nContinuing this, it seems each term is increasing, but how quickly? For large N, the initial terms are very small, so the recursion u_{n} = u_{n-1} + (u_{n-1})^2 can be approximated by a differential equation. Maybe replacing the difference equation with a differential equation could help.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation u_n - u_{n-1} = (u_{n-1})^2. If we model this as a continuous function u(t), the difference u_{n} - u_{n-1} is approximately the derivative du/dt when the step size is 1. So, du/dt ≈ u^2. This differential equation has the solution u(t) = 1/(C - t), where C is a constant. Applying the initial condition u(0) = 1/N, we get C = N. Therefore, the approximate solution is u(t) ≈ 1/(N - t). This suggests that u(t) approaches infinity as t approaches N. But in our discrete case, the sequence would reach 1 when t is around N. However, this is a continuous approximation; the actual discrete sequence might have some error term.\n\nSo, if the continuous approximation is valid, then the number of terms f(N) before u(t) reaches 1 would be roughly N. But since the step size is 1, integrating from t=0 to t=N would give f(N) ≈ N. However, in the examples given, f(N) is slightly larger than N (e.g., f(1000)=1006). This suggests that the approximation might be missing some logarithmic or other correction terms. But as N grows, the relative error (like 6/1000) becomes negligible, so the limit of f(N)/N as N approaches infinity would be 1.\n\nTo formalize this, perhaps we can use telescoping the recursion or find a closed-form expression. Let's try manipulating the recurrence relation. \n\nGiven u_n = u_{n-1} + u_{n-1}^2 = u_{n-1}(1 + u_{n-1}).\n\nTaking reciprocals, let's see:\n\n1/u_n = 1/(u_{n-1}(1 + u_{n-1})) = 1/u_{n-1} - 1/(1 + u_{n-1}).\n\nBut this might not immediately help. Alternatively, consider:\n\n1/u_n - 1/u_{n-1} = -1/(1 + u_{n-1}).\n\nSumming from n=2 to k:\n\nSum_{n=2}^k [1/u_n - 1/u_{n-1}] = - Sum_{n=2}^k 1/(1 + u_{n-1}).\n\nThe left side telescopes to 1/u_k - 1/u_1 = - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m).\n\nRearranging:\n\n1/u_k = 1/u_1 - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m).\n\nSince u_1 = 1/N, this becomes:\n\n1/u_k = N - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m).\n\nWe want to find the smallest k such that u_k >=1. So, when u_k approaches 1, 1/u_k approaches 1, so:\n\nN - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m) ≈ 1\n\nThus, Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m) ≈ N -1.\n\nBut since u_m is increasing, each term 1/(1 + u_m) decreases as m increases. For large N, the initial terms u_m are very small (since u_1 =1/N), so 1/(1 + u_m) ≈1 - u_m + u_m^2 - ..., but maybe approximating Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m) ≈ Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} (1 - u_m). However, I'm not sure if this is helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since for small u_m, 1/(1 + u_m) ≈1 - u_m, so the sum would be approximately (k-1) - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} u_m. But again, how does this help?\n\nGoing back to the differential equation approach. If we model u(t) ≈1/(N - t), then when does u(t) reach 1? Solving 1/(N - t) =1 gives t=N-1. But in reality, the discrete sequence might take a bit longer. However, as N becomes large, the difference between N and N + c (for some constant c) becomes negligible in the limit. So f(N) ≈N + c, so f(N)/N tends to 1.\n\nAlternatively, using the telescoping sum. From the equation:\n\n1/u_k = N - Sum_{m=1}^{k-1} 1/(1 + u_m).\n\nWhen k = f(N) +1, u_k >=1, so 1/u_k <=1. Therefore:\n\nN - Sum_{m=1}^{f(N)} 1/(1 + u_m) <=1.\n\nBut Sum_{m=1}^{f(N)} 1/(1 + u_m) >= Sum_{m=1}^{f(N)} 1/(1 +1) = f(N)/2, since when u_m <1, 1 + u_m <2. But this would give N - f(N)/2 <=1 ⇒ f(N) >=2(N -1). But this contradicts the examples where f(N) ≈N. So this approach must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps another approach. Let's consider that when u_m is small, the recurrence u_{m} =u_{m-1} + u_{m-1}^2 ≈u_{m-1}(1 + u_{m-1}). This resembles the continuous case where du/dk = u^2. The solution is u(k) ≈1/(C -k). Setting u(1)=1/N gives C= N +1. So u(k)≈1/(N +1 -k). This would suggest that u(k) reaches 1 when k ≈N. So f(N)≈N. But why does the example show f(1000)=1006? There's a small overshoot. But as N increases, this overshoot becomes a smaller fraction of N, hence the limit is 1.\n\nTherefore, to formalize the proof, we can approximate the recurrence with a differential equation, show that the solution grows as 1/(N -k), and the number of steps k needed to reach 1 is approximately N. The error term is sublinear in N, so when divided by N, it goes to zero. Hence, the limit is 1.\n\nAlternatively, using the inverse sequence. Let v_k =1/u_k. Then the recurrence becomes v_k = v_{k-1}/(1 + 1/v_{k-1}) ) = v_{k-1}/(1 + u_{k-1}) = v_{k-1} -1/(1 + u_{k-1}). Wait, earlier we had:\n\n1/u_k = 1/u_{k-1} -1/(1 + u_{k-1}).\n\nSo v_k = v_{k-1} - 1/(1 + u_{k-1}).\n\nSumming from k=2 to m:\n\nv_m = v_1 - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1} 1/(1 + u_k).\n\nSince v_1 =N,\n\nv_m = N - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1} 1/(1 + u_k).\n\nWhen u_m reaches 1, v_m =1. So,\n\n1 = N - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1} 1/(1 + u_k).\n\nTherefore, Sum_{k=1}^{m-1} 1/(1 + u_k) =N -1.\n\nBut if u_k is small for k up to m-1 ≈N, then 1/(1 + u_k) ≈1 - u_k. Therefore, Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k) ≈(m-1) - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k.\n\nSo,\n\n(m-1) - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k ≈N -1.\n\nBut from the recurrence, u_{k} =u_{k-1} +u_{k-1}^2. Summing over k, Sum_{k=2}^m u_k = Sum_{k=2}^m (u_{k-1} +u_{k-1}^2).\n\nThus, Sum_{k=2}^m u_k = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2.\n\nBut Sum_{k=2}^m u_k = Sum_{k=1}^m u_k -u_1.\n\nSo,\n\nSum_{k=1}^m u_k -u_1 = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2.\n\nRearranging,\n\nSum_{k=1}^m u_k -u_1 = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2 ⇒\n\nSum_{k=1}^m u_k = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2 + u_1 ⇒\n\nBut Sum_{k=1}^m u_k = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + u_m.\n\nSo,\n\nSum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + u_m = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k + Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2 + u_1 ⇒\n\nu_m = Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k^2 + u_1.\n\nBut this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k is approximately something. If u_k ≈1/(N -k), then Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k ≈Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(N -k) =Sum_{j=N-1}^{N -m +1}1/j ≈ln(N/(N -m +1))). But if m ≈N, then this sum is approximately ln(N/(N -N +1))=ln(N/1)=ln N. But this contradicts the previous equation where the sum is approximately (m-1) - (N -1). Hmm, this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nPerhaps another angle. Notice that when u_k is small, the recurrence is approximately u_k ≈u_{k-1} +u_{k-1}^2, which is similar to a telescoping product. Let's consider the inverse:\n\n1/u_k -1/u_{k-1} = -1/(1 + u_{k-1}}.\n\nSumming from k=2 to m:\n\n1/u_m -1/u_1 = -Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k}.\n\nBut we know that when u_m =1, 1/u_m =1, and 1/u_1 =N. So:\n\n1 -N = -Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} ⇒ Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} =N -1.\n\nBut if the terms 1/(1 +u_k} are each close to 1 (since u_k is small for k <m), then the sum would be approximately m-1 ≈N -1, so m≈N. But in reality, since u_k increases, the terms 1/(1 +u_k} decrease, so the sum is less than m-1. Hence, m-1 must be larger than N -1. Therefore, m >N, which aligns with the examples where f(N)≈N + small terms. However, as N increases, the difference becomes negligible relative to N, hence the limit f(N)/N→1.\n\nTo make this rigorous, we can bound the sum. Since u_k is increasing, 1/(1 +u_k) is decreasing. So for k ≤m-1, u_k ≤u_{m-1} <1. Therefore, 1/(1 +u_k) ≥1/2 for all k ≤m-1. Hence:\n\nSum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} ≥ (m-1)/2.\n\nBut we have Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} =N -1. Therefore:\n\n(m-1)/2 ≤N -1 ⇒m-1 ≤2(N -1) ⇒m ≤2N -1.\n\nBut this is a very loose bound. To get a better estimate, note that for small u_k, 1/(1 +u_k} ≈1 -u_k +u_k^2 -... So Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} ≈Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}(1 -u_k).\n\nHence,\n\nSum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k} ≈(m-1) -Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k.\n\nBut from earlier, Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}u_k is related to the sum of the squares. However, without knowing the exact sum, this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, approximate the sum using integrals. If we model u_k as a continuous function u(k), then the sum Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u(k}} can be approximated by the integral from k=1 to k=m-1 of 1/(1 +u(k)) dk. Similarly, the recurrence u(k+1) -u(k) =u(k)^2 can be approximated by du/dk =u^2, leading to u(k)=1/(C -k). With u(1)=1/N, C=1 +N. So u(k)=1/(N +1 -k). Therefore, the integral from k=1 to k=m-1 of 1/(1 +u(k)) dk becomes integral from 1 to m-1 of 1/(1 +1/(N+1 -k)) dk.\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n1/(1 +1/(N+1 -k)) = (N+1 -k)/(N+1 -k +1) = (N+1 -k)/(N+2 -k).\n\nIntegrating this from k=1 to k=m-1:\n\nIntegral [(N+1 -k)/(N+2 -k) dk] = Integral [1 -1/(N+2 -k) dk] = (m-1 -1) - [ln(N+2 -k)] from 1 to m-1.\n\nWhich simplifies to (m-2) - [ln(N+2 -(m-1)) - ln(N+2 -1))] = (m-2) - [ln(N+3 -m) - ln(N+1))].\n\nSetting this equal to N -1 (from the sum approximation), but this seems complicated. Perhaps for m ≈N, then N+3 -m ≈3, and ln(3) - ln(N+1)) is negligible compared to N. Therefore, approximately:\n\n(m-2) ≈N -1 ⇒m≈N +1.\n\nThis matches the examples where f(N)=number of terms less than 1 is approximately N. Hence, as N grows, the leading term is N, and the difference is lower order, so the limit of f(N)/N is 1.\n\nTo make this rigorous, one would need to show that the error terms in the approximation (like using the differential equation, or the integral approximation) become negligible as N→infty. Techniques from asymptotic analysis or difference equations could be employed. Alternatively, using induction or bounding the sequence.\n\nAnother approach: Let's define k as the number of terms before u_k >=1. We need to show k/N →1 as N→infty.\n\nFrom the recurrence, u_{k} =u_{k-1} +u_{k-1}^2. Let’s consider the inverse sequence v_n =1/u_n. Then:\n\nv_n =1/(u_{n-1} +u_{n-1}^2) =1/(u_{n-1}(1 +u_{n-1})) =1/u_{n-1} *1/(1 +u_{n-1}) =v_{n-1}/(1 +1/v_{n-1}).\n\nSimplifying:\n\nv_n =v_{n-1}/(1 +1/v_{n-1}) )=v_{n-1}/( (v_{n-1} +1)/v_{n-1}) )=v_{n-1}^2/(v_{n-1} +1).\n\nThis recurrence might be more manageable. However, it's still nonlinear. Let’s see if we can telescope it.\n\nAlternatively, from the earlier equation:\n\n1/u_n =1/u_{n-1} -1/(1 +u_{n-1}}.\n\nLet’s denote S_n =Sum_{k=1}^{n}1/(1 +u_k}}.\n\nThen, 1/u_{n} =N - S_{n-1}.\n\nWhen u_{k} <1, we have 1/(1 +u_k} >1/2. Therefore, S_{k} >k/2. Hence, N - S_{k} <N -k/2. When does this become less than or equal to1?\n\nSetting N -k/2 <=1 ⇒k >=2(N -1). But this contradicts the examples where k≈N. So this approach must be too crude. The problem is that for large N, the initial terms u_k are small, so 1/(1 +u_k}≈1 -u_k +u_k^2 -..., which is close to 1. Thus, the sum S_{k} ≈k - Sum u_i + Sum u_i^2 -..., but Sum u_i is related to the cumulative sum of squares.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for large N, the sequence u_k starts very small and increases slowly. So for the first many terms, u_k ≈1/(N -k). Then, Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k}}≈Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +1/(N -k))}≈Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}(N -k)/(N -k +1)}=Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}(1 -1/(N -k +1))}= (m-1) - Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(N -k +1}.\n\nThe sum Sum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(N -k +1}=Sum_{j=N}^{N -m +2}1/j}=H_{N} -H_{N -m +1}, where H_n is the nth harmonic number. For large N and m≈N, this sum is approximately ln(N) - ln(N -m +1)=ln(N/(N -m +1)). \n\nPutting it together:\n\nSum_{k=1}^{m-1}1/(1 +u_k}}≈(m-1) - ln(N/(N -m +1)).\n\nSetting this equal to N -1:\n\n(m-1) - ln(N/(N -m +1)) ≈N -1 ⇒\n\nln(N/(N -m +1)) ≈(m-1) - (N -1)=m -N.\n\nExponentiating both sides:\n\nN/(N -m +1) ≈e^{m -N} ⇒\n\nN ≈(N -m +1)e^{m -N} ⇒\n\nLet’s set m =N +c, where c is some constant (possibly depending on N). Then:\n\nN ≈(N - (N +c) +1)e^{(N +c) -N} ⇒\n\nN ≈(-c +1)e^{c} ⇒\n\nBut for large N, this requires that (-c +1)e^{c} ≈N. However, as N grows, this would imply that c must grow logarithmically, but this seems contradictory. For example, if c=ln N, then e^{c}=N, and (-c +1)e^{c}=(-ln N +1)N. But the left side is N, so we have (-ln N +1)N ≈N ⇒ -ln N +1 ≈1 ⇒ln N≈0 ⇒N≈1, which contradicts large N. Therefore, this approach may not work.\n\nPerhaps instead of setting m=N +c, we need a different substitution. Let’s assume that m=N +x, where x is small compared to N. Then:\n\nln(N/(N - (N +x) +1))=ln(N/(1 -x))=ln(N) -ln(1 -x)≈ln N +x (since x is small).\n\nBut the equation was:\n\nln(N/(N -m +1)) ≈m -N ⇒\n\nln N -ln(N -m +1) ≈m -N.\n\nLet’s set m =N +y. Then N -m +1= N - (N +y) +1=1 -y.\n\nThus:\n\nln N -ln(1 -y) ≈y.\n\nFor large N, ln N is large, but y is related to m -N. Wait, this doesn't make sense unless y is proportional to ln N. Suppose y= ln N +k, then:\n\nln N -ln(1 - (ln N +k)) ≈ln N +k.\n\nBut ln(1 - (ln N +k)) is undefined if 1 - (ln N +k) ≤0. So this approach is not working.\n\nPerhaps the initial assumption that u_k≈1/(N -k) is valid only for k much less than N. Once k approaches N, the approximation breaks down because u_k becomes significant. Therefore, the actual number of terms needed to reach 1 is slightly more than N, but the difference is of lower order, so f(N)/N→1.\n\nTo formalize this, perhaps use the Stolz–Cesàro theorem or other limit comparison techniques. Alternatively, consider that the time to reach 1 in the continuous model is N, and the discrete case differs by a bounded amount, so the ratio goes to1.\n\nIn conclusion, the key steps are:\n\n1. Model the recurrence relation with a differential equation, obtaining u(t)≈1/(N -t).\n2. Conclude that the continuous solution reaches 1 at t=N.\n3. Argue that the discrete sequence's deviation from this is negligible for large N, so f(N)≈N.\n4. Therefore, the limit of f(N)/N is 1.",
