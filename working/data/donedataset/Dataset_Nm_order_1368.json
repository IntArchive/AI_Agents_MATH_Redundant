    "Content": "Hypothesis: Let $G$ be a topological group with identity element $e$.  Let $\\mu$ denote the multiplication mapping in $G$. Goal: Show that $\\pi_1(G,e) = \\pi(G)$ is an abelian group via the hint below. Hint: There are two products on $\\pi(G)$.  The usual product $\\circ$ defined for the fundamental group and the product $\\ast$ induced by $$\n\\ast: \\pi(G) \\times \\pi(G) \\cong \\pi(G \\times G) \\overset{\\pi(\\mu)}{\\rightarrow} \\pi(G).\n$$ Show that there is a common two sided unit, $u \\in \\pi(G)$ for both products and there is a distributive law $$\n(f \\ast g) \\circ (a \\ast b) = (f \\circ a) \\ast (g \\circ b)\n$$ Attempt: Suppose the distributive law in the hint holds.  Suppose further that $1$ -- the identity element in $\\pi(G)$ with respect to $\\circ$ -- serves also as the identity element in $\\pi(G)$ with respect to $\\ast$. Then for $a,b \\in \\pi(G)$, we would have the following relationship: $$\n(1 \\ast a) \\circ (b \\ast 1) = (1 \\circ b) \\ast (a \\circ 1)\n$$ so that $$\na \\circ b = b \\ast a\n$$ Then if we can show that for all $f,g \\in \\pi(G)$ that $f \\ast g \\iff f \\circ g$, we could complete the above relation to $$\na \\circ b = b \\ast a = b \\circ a\n$$ so that $\\pi(G)$ is abelian as desired. Question: Am I on the right track?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "One can get more out of this situation,which especially useful if the topological group $G$ is not connected.  For more details, see this paper . Let $\\tilde{G}$ be the set of homotopy classes rel end points of paths in $G$ which start at $e$ . The group structure of $G$ induces a group structure on $\\tilde{G}$ .  The final point map defines $t: \\tilde{G} \\to G$ , which under appropriate local conditions is the universal cover of $G$ at $e$ .  This morphism may also be given the structure of crossed module , using the conjugation operation of $G$ on $\\tilde{G}$ . Recall that a crossed module $\\mu: M \\to  P$ is a morphism of groups together with an action of $P$ on $M$ written $(m,p) \\mapsto m^p$ with the properties $\\mu(m^p)= p^{-1}\\mu(m) p$ ; $m^{-1}nm=n^{\\mu m}$ for all $m,n \\in M, p \\in P$ . Such a crossed module determines a $k$ -invariant $k \\in H^3(Cok\\; \\mu, Ker\\; \\mu)$ . For the crossed module coming from a topological group as above, the $k$ -invariant is trivial if and only if the topological group $G$ has a universal cover of all components such that the totality can be given the structure of topological group with the covering map a morphism of topological groups.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the original question and what's being asked. The user wants to show that the fundamental group of a topological group G at the identity element e, denoted π₁(G,e) or π(G), is abelian. They provided a hint involving two products on π(G): the usual fundamental group product ∘ and another product ∗ induced by the multiplication map μ in G.\n\nThe key points from the problem are:\n- G is a topological group with identity e.\n- μ: G × G → G is the multiplication map.\n- The product ∗ is defined via π(μ): π(G × G) → π(G), combined with the isomorphism π(G) × π(G) ≅ π(G × G).\n- We need to show there's a common two-sided unit for both ∘ and ∗, and that the distributive law (f ∗ g) ∘ (a ∗ b) = (f ∘ a) ∗ (g ∘ b) holds.\n- The attempt suggests using the identity element 1 (for ∘) as the unit for ∗, then deriving that a ∘ b = b ∗ a, and if ∗ and ∘ are the same, this would make π(G) abelian.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if they're on the right track. Let me verify the steps.\n\nFirst, the distributive law is given in the hint. If we take f, g, a, b in π(G), then applying the distributive law as (f ∗ g) ∘ (a ∗ b) = (f ∘ a) ∗ (g ∘ b). The user then considers the case where f and g are the identity for ∘, which is 1. So substituting f = 1 and a = 1, maybe? Wait, the user's equation is (1 ∗ a) ∘ (b ∗ 1) = (1 ∘ b) ∗ (a ∘ 1). Let's parse this.\n\nIf f = 1, g = a, a = b, b = 1? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal distributive law: (f ∗ g) ∘ (a ∗ b) = (f ∘ a) ∗ (g ∘ b). The user's substitution seems to set f = 1, g = a, a = b, and b = 1. Wait, maybe not. Let's see. The left-hand side (LHS) of their equation is (1 ∗ a) ∘ (b ∗ 1). The right-hand side (RHS) is (1 ∘ b) ∗ (a ∘ 1). So that's substituting f=1, g=a, a=b, b=1 in the distributive law. Is that correct?\n\nYes, because the distributive law applies to any f, g, a, b. So if we set f=1, g=a, a=b, and b=1, then LHS is (1 ∗ a) ∘ (b ∗ 1), and RHS is (1 ∘ b) ∗ (a ∘ 1). Since 1 is the identity for ∘, then 1 ∘ b = b and a ∘ 1 = a. So RHS becomes b ∗ a. The LHS is (1 ∗ a) ∘ (b ∗ 1). Now, if 1 is also the identity for ∗, then 1 ∗ a = a and b ∗ 1 = b. So LHS becomes a ∘ b. Thus, we have a ∘ b = b ∗ a.\n\nBut the goal is to show that a ∘ b = b ∘ a, which would require that b ∗ a = b ∘ a. So if we can show that the two products ∗ and ∘ are the same, then we have a ∘ b = b ∘ a. The user suggests that if f ∗ g = f ∘ g for all f, g, then this would hold, making the group abelian.\n\nBut how do we show that ∗ and ∘ are the same? Alternatively, maybe even without them being the same, the relationship a ∘ b = b ∗ a combined with some other properties might lead to abelianness.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another approach. Since the two products have the same unit and satisfy the distributive law, maybe we can use Eckmann-Hilton argument? The Eckmann-Hilton argument states that if a set has two unital binary operations that distribute over each other, then they are the same operation and commutative. This seems similar.\n\nIn the problem, we have two products: ∘ (the usual concatenation of loops for the fundamental group) and ∗ (induced by the group multiplication μ of G). The hint suggests showing they have the same unit and satisfy the distributive law. This is exactly the setup for Eckmann-Hilton. Therefore, if the two operations share the same unit and distribute over each other, then they must be commutative and in fact the same operation.\n\nTherefore, the user is on the right track. By showing that the two products have the same unit and satisfy the distributive law, we can apply the Eckmann-Hilton argument to conclude that π(G) is abelian.\n\nBut the user's attempt seems to derive that a ∘ b = b ∗ a, and if ∗ is the same as ∘, then a ∘ b = b ∘ a. However, the Eckmann-Hilton argument actually shows that the operations must coincide and be commutative. So perhaps the user is missing the direct application of Eckmann-Hilton, but their approach is a part of the argument.\n\nIn summary, the user is correctly using the given distributive law and the common unit to relate the two products. However, invoking the Eckmann-Hilton argument would solidify the conclusion that the group is abelian. So yes, the user is on the right track.",
