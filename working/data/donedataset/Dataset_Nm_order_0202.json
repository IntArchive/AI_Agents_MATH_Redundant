    "Content": "Quite a while ago, I heard about a statement in measure theory, that goes as follows: Let $A \\subset \\mathbb R^n$ be a Lebesgue-measurable set of positive measure. Then we follow that $A-A = \\{ x-y \\mid x,y\\in A\\}$ is a neighborhood of zero, i.e. contains an open ball around zero. I now got reminded of that statement as I have the homework problem (Kolmogorov, Introductory Real Analysis, p. 268, Problem 5): Prove that every set of positive measure in the interval $[0,1]$ contains a pair of points whose distance apart is a rational number. The above statement would obviously prove the homework problem and I would like to prove the more general statement. I think that assuming the opposite and taking a sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converging to zero such that none of the elements are contained in $A$, we might be able to define an ascending/descending chain $A_n$ such that the union/intersection is $A$ but the limit of its measures zero. I am in lack of ideas for the definition on those $A_n$. I am asking specifically not for an answer but a hint on the problem. Especially if my idea turns out to be fruitful for somebody, a notice would be great. Or if another well-known theorem is needed, I surely would want to know. Thank you for your help.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's an attempt at a hint for the first result you ask about: Assume without loss of generality that $A$ has finite measure. Let $f$ be the characteristic function of $A$ and let $\\tilde{f}$ be the one of $-A$. The convolution $g = f \\ast \\tilde{f}$ is continuous and $0$ is in the support of $g$. Added later: One nice standard application is that every measurable homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. For more on that and related matters have a look at these two MO-threads: On measurable homomorphisms $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ . On measurable automorphisms of locally compact groups They might elucidate what is mentioned in another answer. Update: What I wrote above is the way I prefer to prove this. Another approach is to appeal to regularity of Lebesgue measure $\\lambda$ (used in $1$ and $2$ below). Since $A$ contains a compact set of positive measure, we can assume $A$ to be compact right away (as $B-B \\subset A - A$ if $B \\subset A$). There is an open set $U \\supset A$ such that $\\lambda(U) \\lt 2 \\lambda(A)$. Since $A$ is compact there is $I = (-\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon)^{n}$ such that $A + x \\subset U$ for all $x \\in I$. Since $\\lambda (U) \\lt 2\\lambda(A)$ we must have $\\lambda((A + x) \\cap A) \\gt 0$. This is of course very closely related to the argument given by Chandru1 below.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to read the original problem carefully and extract the necessary information.\n\nThe original problem is from a user who mentions a statement in measure theory: if A is a subset of R^n with positive Lebesgue measure, then A - A contains an open ball around zero. They connect this to a homework problem from Kolmogorov's book, which asks to prove that every set of positive measure in [0,1] contains two points at a rational distance apart. The user wants to prove the more general statement and is seeking a hint, not a full answer.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let's start with the Assumptions. The problem mentions a set A in [0,1] with positive measure. So the assumptions should list that A is a subset of [0,1], it's Lebesgue measurable, and has positive measure. Each assumption should be a single line addressing one property of one object.\n\nThe problem is to prove that such a set A contains a pair of points with a rational distance between them. The more general statement the user refers to (A - A containing a neighborhood of zero) would imply the homework problem because if A - A contains an open ball around zero, then there are points x and y in A such that x - y is a small enough rational number. But the homework problem specifically is about rational distances, not necessarily that A - A is a neighborhood of zero. However, the user wants to approach the general statement to solve the homework problem.\n\nWait, but the original problem presented by the user is the homework problem from Kolmogorov, so that's the Problem part. The assumptions are about the set A in [0,1], being measurable, and having positive measure. The more general statement about A - A containing a neighborhood of zero is part of the user's thought process but isn't part of the structured problem unless it's part of the assumptions. But in the example given, the Assumption includes conditions on the problem's objects. Here, the problem is to show that A contains two points with a rational distance, given that A is in [0,1], measurable, and has positive measure. The user is trying to connect this to the more general theorem about A - A containing a neighborhood of zero, but the structured problem should focus on the homework problem as stated. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a subset of [0,1]\n- A is Lebesgue measurable\n- A has positive Lebesgue measure\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a pair of points in A with a rational distance between them.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. The original problem mentions the set is in [0,1], measurable, and has positive measure. So that's three separate assumptions. The problem is exactly as stated in the homework problem.",
