    "Content": "The limit\n$$\\lim_{a \\to \\infty} \\int_0^a \\sin x \\, \\mathrm{d} x$$\ndoes not exist. However, consider that\n$$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_0^\\infty e^{- \\epsilon x} \\sin x \\, \\mathrm{d} x  = 1 \\,.$$\nHere I have 'regulated' the integral. What I discovered, and what strikes me as very surprising, is that if, instead of an exponential, I choose a different function $f(x, \\epsilon)$ which tends pointwise to $1$ as $\\epsilon$ goes to $0$ and tends to $0$ as $x$ goes to $\\infty$, I get convergence to exactly the same limit. So if I choose\n$$ f(x, \\epsilon)  = \\frac{1}{1 + \\epsilon x^2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mathrm{sech}^2(\\epsilon x) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (1 + 2 \\epsilon x^2) e^{-\\epsilon x^2}\\,,$$\nThen the integral of $f(x, \\epsilon) \\sin x$ from 0 to $\\infty$ tends to $1$ as $\\epsilon$ tends to $0$. Why is this happening? EDIT: I was initially satisfied with the responses given, but on further thought I don't think I follow the logic of tired's answer, which invokes the stationary phase approximation. In particular, my understanding of the stationary phase approximation is that one looks for stationary points of the argument of the exponential since these correspond to the points where the oscillation is slowest – away from this point, the oscillations 'cancel out' because of how rapid they are. However, in this case the argument of the exponential has no stationary points. Further, whilst I can appreciate that (in the case where there are no stationary points) a 'boundary maximum point' would dominate the integral in the real case (that is, for which the argument of the exponential is real), I can't see that this would be relevant in the imaginary case. I am looking for an answer that includes the following three points: A proof that the limit of this integral is independent of regulator (for a suitable class of regulator). Some intuition as to why we might expect this particular integral to be independent of regulator. Information on whether there is some general theory about assigning, perhaps uniquely, a value to non-convergent integrals. In particular, I would like to know whether the fact that the integral at the top of this question is 'almost convergent' (in the sense that it is bounded for all $a$) makes it easier to unambiguously regulate.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a partial answer that seconds @Jack D'Aurizio 's idea. Let us focus on the class of locally integrable functions $f : [0,\\infty) \\to \\Bbb{R}$ such that $f(0) = 1 = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x)$, and $ I(f, \\epsilon) := \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\int_{0}^{R} f(\\epsilon x) \\sin x \\, dx$ converges for all $\\epsilon > 0$. For appropriate choices of $f$, this covers many classical summability methods: If $f(x) = \\mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}(x)$, then $I(f,\\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{1/\\epsilon} \\sin x \\, dx$ corresponds to the ordinary definition of improper integrability. If $f(x) = (1 - x)_+$, then $I(f, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon \\int_{0}^{1/\\epsilon} \\int_{0}^{x} f(t) \\, dtdx $ corredponds to the Cesaro summability. If $f(x) = e^{-x}$, then $I(f, \\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\epsilon x} \\sin x \\, dx$ corresponds to the Abel summability. It also covers all the examples you have discussed. We can simply choose $f(x)$ to be $$ \\frac{1}{1+x^2}, \\quad \\operatorname{sech}^2 x, \\quad (1 + 2x^2)e^{-x^2}, \\quad \\cdots. $$ Since we know that 1 fails to converge while 2 and 3 converge, we may suspect that regularity of $f$ is one factor which determines how regularly $I(f,\\epsilon)$ behaves. Toward this direction, let us make the following assumption: Assumption 1. We have $f(x) = \\int_{x}^{\\infty} \\rho(t) \\, dt$ for some $\\rho$ which is integrable on $[0, \\infty)$. Under this condition, let us show that $I(f, \\epsilon)$ converges to $1$. Indeed, by the Fubini's theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{R} f(\\epsilon x) \\sin x \\, dx\n&= \\int_{0}^{R} \\left( \\int_{\\epsilon x}^{\\infty} \\rho(t) \\, dt \\right) \\sin x \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{0}^{(t/\\epsilon) \\wedge R} \\sin x \\, dx \\right) \\rho(t) \\, dt \\\\\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [ 1 - \\cos ((t/\\epsilon) \\wedge R) ] \\rho(t) \\, dt.\n\\end{align*} Now we can apply the dominated convergence theorem to the last integral to find that $I(f, \\epsilon)$ converges and is given by $$ I(f, \\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} ( 1 - \\cos (t/\\epsilon) ) \\rho(t) \\, dt. $$ Taking $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, Riemann-Lebesgue lemma tells that the last integral converges to: $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} I(f, \\epsilon) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(t) \\, dt = f(0^+) = 1. $$ This proof already hints us that this regularization captures the notion of the average of the antiderivative $\\int_{0}^{x} \\sin t \\, dt = 1 - \\cos x$. Indeed, with a bit of extra assumption, we can check that this regularization yields the integral of a nice function in Cesaro summability sense. Let us formalize this claim. Assumption 2. $f$ satisfies Assumption 1 with $\\rho : [0, \\infty) \\to \\Bbb{R}$ which is of bounded variation and satisfies $\\int_{[0,\\infty)} x |d\\rho(x)| < \\infty$. $\\varphi : [0,\\infty) \\to \\Bbb{R}$ is locally integrable such that the antiderivative $\\Phi(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\varphi(t) \\, dt$ is bounded and has Cesaro-mean $\\ell \\in \\Bbb{R}$, i.e., $\\frac{1}{R} \\int_{0}^{R} \\Phi(x) \\, dx \\to \\ell$ as $R \\to \\infty$. Although this assumption seems technical, it loosely tells that $\\rho$ does not oscillate heavily and that $\\Phi$ is bounded and has an average. As in the previous proof, we find that $$\n\\int_{0}^{R} f(\\epsilon x) \\varphi(x) \\, dx\n= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Phi((t/\\epsilon)\\wedge R) \\rho(t) \\, dt\n\\xrightarrow[R\\to\\infty]{} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Phi(t/\\epsilon) \\rho(t) \\, dt.\n$$ Now from the assumption that $\\rho$ is of bounded variation, we easily find that  $\\rho(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Thus by the Fubini's theorem again, \\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Phi(t/\\epsilon) \\rho(t) \\, dt\n&= \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Phi(t/\\epsilon) \\left( - \\int_{(t,\\infty)} d\\rho(u) \\right) \\, dt \\\\\n&= \\int_{(0,\\infty)} \\left( \\int_{0}^{u} \\Phi(t/\\epsilon) \\, dt \\right) \\, d\\rho(u) \\\\\n&= \\int_{(0,\\infty)} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{u} \\int_{0}^{u/\\epsilon} \\Phi(t') \\, dt' \\right) u \\, d\\rho(u)\n\\end{align*} where $t' = t/\\epsilon$. Then by the assumption, we can invoke the dominated convergence theorem to find that the last integral converges to: $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{(0,\\infty)} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{u} \\int_{0}^{u/\\epsilon} \\Phi(t') \\, dt' \\right) u \\, d\\rho(u)\n= \\int_{(0,\\infty)} \\ell u \\, d\\rho(u)\n= \\ell. $$ Putting together, we have $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(\\epsilon x) \\varphi(x) \\, dx = \\ell = \\lim_{R\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{R}\\int_{0}^{R} \\int_{0}^{x} \\varphi(t) \\, dtdx. \\tag{*}$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about regulating the integral of sin x from 0 to infinity using different functions and why they all converge to the same limit. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. The problem mentions several things: the limit of the integral as a approaches infinity doesn't exist, but when using a regulator like e^{-εx}, the limit as ε approaches 0 gives 1. Then different regulators (f(x, ε)) are used, which all tend to 1 as ε→0 and 0 as x→∞. The user also mentions wanting a proof that the limit is independent of the regulator, intuition why, and information on general theories of assigning values to non-convergent integrals.\n\nSo, the assumptions would include:\n\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is regulated by a function f(x, ε).\n- f(x, ε) tends pointwise to 1 as ε→0.\n- f(x, ε) tends to 0 as x→∞ for each ε > 0.\n- The class of regulators f(x, ε) is suitable (needs to be specified, maybe as smooth and decaying sufficiently fast? But the original question doesn't specify, so perhaps just the given conditions).\n- The regulated integral ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx converges for each ε > 0.\n- The limit as ε→0 of this integral is considered.\n\nWait, but the problem as posed by the user is asking why all these different regulators give the same limit. So the assumptions are about the properties of f(x, ε), and the problem is to show that under these conditions, the limit is always 1.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key assumptions are about the regulator functions. Let me parse the original question again.\n\nOriginal problem mentions:\n\n- The integral without regulator (lim a→∞ ∫₀^a sin x dx) does not exist (diverges).\n- Using f(x, ε) = e^{-ε x}, the regulated integral tends to 1 as ε→0.\n- Other regulators (1/(1+εx²), sech²(εx), (1+2εx²)e^{-εx²}) all also lead to the integral tending to 1.\n- The user is asking why this happens, seeking a proof that the limit is independent of the regulator (for a suitable class), intuition, and information on general theory.\n\nSo to structure this into the format:\n\nAssumptions need to list the conditions that the regulator function f(x, ε) must satisfy. The problem is to explain why, under these conditions, the regulated integral converges to 1.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f(x, ε) is a function of x and ε.\n- For each ε > 0, lim_{x→∞} f(x, ε) = 0.\n- For each x ≥ 0, lim_{ε→0} f(x, ε) = 1.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx converges for every ε > 0.\n- The class of regulators f(x, ε) is such that they decay sufficiently as x→∞ (maybe uniform exponential decay? But the user's examples include algebraic decay like 1/(1+εx²), which is slower. So perhaps the class is regulators that are of appropriate decay to make the integral converge for each ε >0, but no more specifics given. So the assumptions are just the pointwise limits and convergence of the integral for each ε.\n\nAdditionally, the problem mentions that the original integral is 'almost convergent' (bounded for all a), which might be another assumption, but it's part of the problem's context rather than an explicit condition.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n (integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key assumptions are on the regulator function f(x, ε). So each line in the assumption section should address one property of f(x, ε) or the integral.\n\nSo, list each assumption line by line:\n\n- f(x, ε) is a function defined for x ≥ 0 and ε > 0.\n- For each ε > 0, lim_{x→∞} f(x, ε) = 0.\n- For each x ≥ 0, lim_{ε→0} f(x, ε) = 1.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ |f(x, ε) sin x| dx converges for every ε > 0.\n- The original integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is conditionally convergent but not absolutely convergent.\n\nWait, but the original integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is actually divergent. The user says \"the limit as a→∞ of ∫₀^a sin x dx does not exist\". So it's oscillating between 0 and 2. So maybe another assumption is that the original integral is oscillatory and divergent.\n\nBut in the problem structure, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. So perhaps the assumptions are on the regulator functions and the behavior of the original integral.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking why different regulators give the same limit. So the key assumptions are on the regulator functions: they tend to 1 as ε→0 pointwise, decay at infinity for each ε, and the regulated integral converges. Then the problem is to prove that under these conditions, the limit is 1.\n\nBut the original question's edit adds more context: the user wants a proof of independence of the regulator, intuition, and info on general theory. So the problem as stated is asking for an explanation why all these regulators lead to the same limit.\n\nTherefore, the problem part would be: Explain why the limit as ε→0 of ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx equals 1 for any regulator f(x, ε) satisfying certain conditions.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, the problem is to explain why the limit is 1 regardless of the regulator, given the conditions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- f(x, ε) is a function of x ≥ 0 and ε > 0.\n- For each ε > 0, lim_{x→∞} f(x, ε) = 0.\n- For each x ≥ 0, lim_{ε→0} f(x, ε) = 1.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx converges for every ε > 0.\n- The original integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is conditionally convergent but divergent.\n\nWait, but the original integral isn't convergent. So maybe that's part of the problem's context. The problem is about regulating a divergent integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The improper integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx does not converge.\n- For each ε > 0, f(x, ε) tends to 0 as x → ∞.\n- For each x ≥ 0, f(x, ε) tends to 1 as ε → 0.\n- The regulated integral ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx converges for each ε > 0.\n- The limit of the regulated integral as ε → 0 is considered.\n\nSo the problem is to show that this limit is 1 for any such f(x, ε).\n\nBut the user's edit mentions they want a proof that the limit is independent of the regulator for a suitable class. So maybe the suitable class needs to be specified in assumptions. However, the original problem doesn't specify the exact class, just gives examples. So perhaps the assumptions are as above, and the problem is to explain why the limit is always 1 under these assumptions.\n\nBut maybe more precise: the regulators should be such that their Fourier transforms (since sin x is oscillatory) have certain properties, or that they decay sufficiently fast. However, since the examples include algebraic decay, maybe the class is functions that are L^1 for each ε, but the original problem doesn't specify. Since the user hasn't defined the exact class, we can only go by the given conditions.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- For each ε > 0, f(x, ε) is a function such that ∫₀^∞ |f(x, ε) sin x| dx converges.\n- As ε → 0, f(x, ε) → 1 pointwise for each x ≥ 0.\n- As x → ∞, f(x, ε) → 0 for each ε > 0.\n- The original integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is divergent.\n\nProblem:\n\nExplain why the limit as ε → 0 of ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx equals 1 for any such function f(x, ε).\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is more about the independence of the regulator. So the problem would be: Prove that the limit of the regulated integral is 1 for any regulator f(x, ε) satisfying the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is phrased as: Why does the regulated integral converge to 1 regardless of the choice of f(x, ε)? Then that's the problem.\n\nIn the example, the problem was to prove divisibility. Here, it's to explain the reason for the convergence to 1.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- For each ε > 0, the function f(x, ε) tends to 0 as x approaches infinity.\n- For each x ≥ 0, the function f(x, ε) tends to 1 as ε approaches 0.\n- The integral ∫₀^∞ f(x, ε) sin x dx converges for every ε > 0.\n- The improper Riemann integral ∫₀^∞ sin x dx is divergent.\n\nProblem:\nExplain why the limit\n$$\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_0^\\infty f(x, \\epsilon) \\sin x \\, \\mathrm{d} x = 1$$\nfor any function f(x, ε) satisfying the above assumptions.",
