    "Content": "Exercise 0.26 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology is Use Corollary 0.20 to show that if $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension\n  property, then $X \\times I$ deformation retracts to $X \\times \\{0\\}\n \\cup A \\times I$. Here Corollary 0.20 says Corollary 0.20 : If $(X,A)$ satisfies the homotopy extension property and the inclusion $A \\hookrightarrow X$ is a\n  homotopy equivalence, then $A$ is a deformation retract of $X$. My answer to the exercise seemed a little too neat, and I wanted to double-check. Let $\\iota: X \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I \\to X \\times I$ be the inclusion. From the fact that $(X,A)$ has the homotopy extension property, we get a retract $r:X \\times I \\to X \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I$. Since $r \\circ \\iota$ is already the identity, we just need to show that $\\iota \\circ r$ is homotopic to $1_{X \\times I}$. To do this, I just showed that $1_{X \\times I}$ and $\\iota \\circ r$ both homotope to the same map, namely $\\pi: (x,t) \\mapsto (x,0)$. The former is obvious; for the latter, if $F$ is the homotopy from $1_{X \\times I}$ to $\\pi$ then $\\iota \\circ r \\circ F$ is a homotopy from $\\iota \\circ r$ to $\\pi$. Does that seem right? It seemed a little too easy. Thinking about how to generalize this, it seems like given $A \\subset X$, we can say that $A \\simeq X$ so long as we have a map $X \\to A$ which is the identity on a space $B \\subset A$ where $B$ is a deformation retract of $X$. Is there a better way to generalize? Edit: Stefan Hamcke points out that I also need to show that $X \\times I, X \\times \\{0 \\} \\cup A \\times I$ has the homotopy extension property, and since this was not obvious to me at first, I will record the proof here for reference. We have a retract $r: X \\times I \\to X \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I$, and we want to find a retract $\\rho: X \\times I \\times I \\to X \\times I \\times \\{0\\} \\cup (X \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I ) \\times I$ $= X \\times (\\{0\\} \\times I \\cup I \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup A \\times I \\times I$. We can use $r$ to get a retract from $X \\times I \\times I \\to (X \\times \\{0\\} \\cup A \\times I )\\times I$. But there is an automorphism of $X \\times I \\times I$ which takes $X \\times (\\{0\\} \\times I \\cup I \\times \\{0\\})$ homeomorphically to $X \\times \\{0\\} \\times I$, where we just imagine sliding deforming the points on the boundary square, and then extending this to the solid square. See here .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "You are right. Since $1_{X\\times I}$ is homotopic to $\\pi$, we have $\\iota r\\simeq \\iota r\\pi=\\pi\\simeq 1_{X×I}$, which shows that $\\iota$ and $r$ are homotopy inverse to each other. It is indeed that easy. To be honest, you can have it even easier by using the general fact that if some map $f$ and the composite $gf$ are homotopy equivalences, then the map $g$ is a homotopy equivalence as well. More precisely, if $h$ is the homotopy inverse of $gf$, then $fh$ will be the homotopy inverse of $g$, as one checks by the calculation\n$$g(fh)=(gf)h\\simeq 1 \\\\\n(fh)g\\simeq(fh)g(fk)=f(h(gf))k\\simeq fk\\simeq 1$$\nwhere $k$ is the homotopy inverse of $f$. This also shows that $k\\simeq hg$. Setting $f:X\\times\\{0\\}\\hookrightarrow X×\\{0\\}\\cup A×I$ and $g=\\iota$, can you see what the homotopy inverses for $f$ and $\\iota f:X×\\{0\\}\\hookrightarrow X×I$ are? Actually, you already used it in your proof. The general proof shows that $X×\\{0\\}\\cup A×I\\hookrightarrow X\\times I$ is always a homotopy equivalence, though it's a deformation retract only if $(X,A)$ has the HEP.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is referring to Exercise 0.26 in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology, which asks to show that if the pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property, then X × I deformation retracts to X × {0} ∪ A × I. They mentioned using Corollary 0.20, which states that if (X, A) has the homotopy extension property and the inclusion A ↪ X is a homotopy equivalence, then A is a deformation retract of X.\n\nThe original question included a user's attempt and some discussion. The user's approach was to use the homotopy extension property to get a retraction r from X×I to X×{0} ∪ A×I. Then they wanted to show that the inclusion followed by this retraction is homotopic to the identity on X×I. They mentioned homotoping both the identity and the composition ι∘r to the same map π, which sends (x, t) to (x, 0). \n\nBut there's an edit where Stefan Hamcke points out that they also need to verify that the pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the homotopy extension property. The user then tried to address this by constructing a retract using an automorphism of X×I×I.\n\nSo, to structure the problem according to the given format, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the problem is to prove that X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I given that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. The pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n2. Corollary 0.20 is to be used, which requires that the inclusion A ↪ X is a homotopy equivalence (though in the original problem statement, it's the homotopy extension property that's given, not directly the homotopy equivalence of the inclusion. Wait, but the user is supposed to use Corollary 0.20, which does have the condition that the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. Hmm, but in the problem statement, the given is only the homotopy extension property. So maybe there's an implicit step where the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence because of the HEP? Or perhaps not. Wait, no—Corollary 0.20 states that if (X,A) has HEP and inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, then A is a deformation retract. But in this exercise, we are supposed to use Corollary 0.20 to show the deformation retraction. Therefore, perhaps the pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the HEP, and the inclusion of X×{0} ∪ A×I into X×I is a homotopy equivalence, so by Corollary 0.20, it's a deformation retract. \n\nBut the problem as stated in the exercise is: Use Corollary 0.20 to show that if (X, A) has the HEP, then X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I. So the key assumption is that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. The user's answer involved getting a retraction r, and then trying to show homotopy equivalence. However, Stefan pointed out the need to verify that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the HEP, which the user then addressed with a retract construction.\n\nSo for the assumptions:\n\n1. (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n2. The problem refers to using Corollary 0.20, which requires that the inclusion map of the subspace into the space is a homotopy equivalence. But in the exercise, the original pair (X, A) has HEP, and the task is to show X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I. Therefore, perhaps the application of Corollary 0.20 is to the pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I). So to apply the corollary, we need to check two things: that this pair has the HEP and that the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. Hence, the user's assumption might be that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the HEP, but actually, this is something that needs to be proven using the fact that (X, A) has HEP. So maybe the problem's assumption is only that (X, A) has HEP, and then through some steps, we can show that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) also has HEP, allowing the application of Corollary 0.20. \n\nBut according to the problem statement as given by the user, the problem is to use Corollary 0.20 to show the deformation retract. So the main assumption provided in the problem is that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. The other condition for Corollary 0.20 is that the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. Therefore, perhaps the user needs to show that the inclusion of X×{0} ∪ A×I into X×I is a homotopy equivalence, which would then allow applying Corollary 0.20 to get that it's a deformation retract. \n\nBut how does (X, A) having HEP lead to the inclusion of X×{0} ∪ A×I into X×I being a homotopy equivalence? That might be part of the required steps, but as per the problem's original statement, the user is supposed to use Corollary 0.20, so maybe the key assumptions are:\n\n- The pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n- The inclusion map X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence (which needs to be established as part of the problem, but perhaps is a consequence of the HEP of (X, A)).\n\nBut in the problem, the only given is that (X, A) has HEP, and the rest needs to be proven. However, in the user's attempt, they used the HEP to get a retraction r, and then tried to show homotopy equivalence. Stefan's correction pointed out that they need to ensure the HEP for (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I). Therefore, perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n1. (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n2. The pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the homotopy extension property (which is derived from (X, A) having HEP via the retract argument provided by the user in their edit).\n3. The inclusion X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence (which might follow from the HEP and the retraction r).\n\nBut according to the problem as stated by the user, the task is to show the deformation retraction using Corollary 0.20. Corollary 0.20 requires that the pair (here, (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I)) has HEP and that the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence, hence leading to the conclusion that X×{0} ∪ A×I is a deformation retract of X×I. Therefore, to apply Corollary 0.20, both HEP and homotopy equivalence of inclusion are needed. The original problem gives (X, A) has HEP, and the user must derive the required conditions for Corollary 0.20 in the context of X×I and its subspace.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n1. The pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n2. The inclusion map X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence. (This is something that needs to be shown, but perhaps under the given assumption of (X,A) having HEP)\n3. The pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the homotopy extension property. (Which is needed to apply Corollary 0.20, but again, this is derived from the original HEP of (X,A))\n\nBut in the problem statement as given in the exercise, the only explicit assumption is that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. The rest are steps that need to be taken. However, the user's answer tried to use the retraction r from X×I to the subspace, and then check the homotopy. Stefan pointed out the missing HEP for the new pair. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be those given in the problem statement, not the ones derived. But the example given by the user included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was not in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. The user might have made a mistake in their example. However, in their formatted problem, they wrote:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption shouldn't include that n is divisible by 7. Unless perhaps there was a miscommunication. Maybe the user intended to have the problem when n is divisible by 7? But in any case, according to the instructions, I need to format the current problem as per the example.\n\nBut in the current problem, the original problem is: If (X,A) has the homotopy extension property, then X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I. The task is to structure this as per the example. In the example, assumptions were listed even if they were part of the problem's universal condition (like n being an integer), and added a condition (n divisible by 7). But in reality, in the original problem, n is any integer, so the assumption should be just n is an integer, but the example mistakenly added n divisible by 7. However, given that the user provided that example, I have to follow their format, even if the example is flawed.\n\nSo for the current problem: The original problem states that if (X,A) has the HEP, then X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I. Therefore, the assumption here is (X,A) has the homotopy extension property. However, in the user's attempt, they needed to also consider that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has HEP. So perhaps the assumptions to list are:\n\n- (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n- (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the homotopy extension property.\n- The inclusion X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the only given is that (X,A) has HEP. The other conditions are to be established as part of the proof. However, the user's answer tried to address these, and Stefan pointed out the need to check HEP for the new pair. So maybe the formatted problem should include only the given assumption, which is (X,A) has the homotopy extension property. The other conditions are part of the problem's proof steps, not assumptions.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, they added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which was not in the original problem. So perhaps the user wants to split the problem's conditions into individual assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. But in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, which contradicts. Therefore, maybe the user made an error in their example, but as per their instructions, we should follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to filter out unrelated information. For the current problem, the original problem is: Use Corollary 0.20 to show that if (X,A) has HEP, then X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I.\n\nThus, the key assumptions are:\n\n- (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n- Corollary 0.20 is applicable (but Corollary 0.20's conditions are part of the proof, not assumptions of the problem).\n\nBut according to the example, the formatted problem's assumptions are those given in the problem. So in this case, the only assumption given is that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. The problem is to prove that X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I.\n\nBut the user's example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, which might have been a mistake. But since the user's example did that, perhaps in the current problem, we should list all necessary assumptions, even if they are part of the problem's statement. Wait, the original problem says \"if (X,A) has the homotopy extension property, then...\", so the assumption is that (X,A) has HEP. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that as the assumption.\n\nBut in the example, the original problem was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps the user's approach is to list all the hypotheses needed for the problem, breaking down each condition, even if they are part of the original problem's statement. In the example, the problem was to show divisibility by 91, which factors into 7×13. So maybe the user assumed n is divisible by 7 and 13, but in reality, the original problem stated for every integer n, so perhaps the example is wrong.\n\nGiven the confusion, but following the user's example structure, for the current problem:\n\nOriginal problem: If (X,A) has HEP, then X×I deformation retracts to X×{0} ∪ A×I.\n\nTherefore, the assumption is:\n\n- The pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n\nProblem: Prove that X × I deformation retracts to X × {0} ∪ A × I.\n\nBut the user's answer and Stefan's correction indicate that there are additional steps involving the HEP of the new pair and homotopy equivalence. But according to the problem's instructions, the task is to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem, filtering out unrelated info. The original problem's only assumption is (X,A) has HEP. The rest is part of the proof. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X × I deformation retracts to X × {0} ∪ A × I.\n\nBut wait, the example had multiple assumptions listed line by line. In the original example, even though the problem was for every integer n, the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". However, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. Perhaps the user made a mistake there. But given that, for the current problem, the only assumption is that (X, A) has the homotopy extension property. However, in the user's discussion, they needed to use that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has HEP, which is derived from (X,A) having HEP. So perhaps that derived condition should be listed as an assumption? But according to the problem statement, it's not given; it's part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, perhaps only the original assumption is listed.\n\nBut given the user's example included an extra assumption not in the original problem, maybe the current problem's assumption should include the necessary conditions to apply Corollary 0.20. Corollary 0.20 requires that the pair has HEP and the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. Therefore, to apply the corollary to (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I), we need:\n\n1. (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has HEP.\n2. The inclusion X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nBut the original problem only states that (X,A) has HEP. Thus, the user must show that (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has HEP and the inclusion is a homotopy equivalence. Therefore, in the problem statement formatted according to the user's example, perhaps the assumptions would include:\n\n- The pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n- The pair (X×I, X×{0} ∪ A×I) has the homotopy extension property.\n- The inclusion X×{0} ∪ A×I ↪ X×I is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nBut this seems like including things that are part of the proof rather than given assumptions. The problem says \"if (X,A) has the HEP, then...\", so the only given is (X,A) has HEP. Therefore, the correct formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nThe pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X × I deformation retracts to X × {0} ∪ A × I.\n\nBut since the user's example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem, maybe the current problem should list assumptions needed beyond the original problem's statement. However, that would be incorrect. Probably, the user's example was flawed, but following their instruction, we should list the assumptions as per the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe pair (X, A) has the homotopy extension property.\n\nProblem:\nProve that X × I deformation retracts to X × {0} ∪ A × I.",
