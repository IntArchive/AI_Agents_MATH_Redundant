    "Content": "Problem : Let $x > 0$ . Prove that $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} \\ge \\frac12 x^2 + \\frac12.$$ Remark 1 : The problem was posted on MSE (now closed ). Remark 2 : I have a proof (see below). My proof is not nice.\nFor example, we need to prove that $\\frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1} + \\frac{12}{7} - \\frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7} \\le 0$ for all $0 < x < 1$ for which my proof is not nice. I want to know if there are some nice proofs. Also, I want my proof reviewed for its correctness. Any comments and solutions are welcome and appreciated. My proof (sketch) : We split into cases: i) $x \\ge 1$ : Clearly, $x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}}\\ge x^x$ .\nBy Bernoulli's inequality, we have $x^x = (1 + (x - 1))^x \\ge 1 + (x - 1)x = x^2 - x + 1 \\ge \\frac12 x^2 + \\frac12$ . The inequality is true. ii) $0 < x < 1$ : It suffices to prove that $$x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}\\ln x \\ge \\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}$$ or $$x^{x^{x^{x^x}}} \\le \\frac{\\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}}{\\ln x}$$ or $$x^{x^{x^x}}\\ln x \\le \\ln \\frac{\\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}}{\\ln x}$$ or $$x^{x^{x^x}}\\ge \\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\ln \\frac{\\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}}{\\ln x}.$$ It suffices to prove that $$x^{x^{x^x}}\\ge \\frac{7}{12} \\ge \\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\ln \\frac{\\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}}{\\ln x}. \\tag{1}$$ First, it is easy to prove that $$x^x \\ge \\mathrm{e}^{-1/\\mathrm{e}}\n\\ge \\frac{1}{\\ln x}\\ln\\frac{\\ln\\frac{7}{12}}{\\ln x}.$$ Thus, the left inequality in (1) is true. Second, let $f(x) = x^{7/12}\\ln x - \\ln \\frac{x^2 + 1}{2}$ . We have \\begin{align*}\n\tf'(x) &= \\frac{7}{12x^{5/12}}\n\t\\left(\\ln x + \\frac{12}{7} - \\frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7}\\right)\\\\\n\t&\\le \\frac{7}{12x^{5/12}}\n\t\\left(\\frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1} + \\frac{12}{7} - \\frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7}\\right)\\\\\n\t&\\le 0 \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*} where we have used $\\ln x \\le \\frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1}$ for all $x$ in $(0, 1]$ .\nAlso, $f(1) = 0$ . Thus, $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$ in $(0, 1)$ .\nThus, the right inequality in (1) is true. Note : For the inequality $\\frac{3x^2 - 3}{x^2 + 4x + 1} + \\frac{12}{7} - \\frac{24x^{17/12}}{7x^2 + 7} \\le 0$ for all $0 < x < 1$ ,\nwe let $x = y^{12}$ and it suffices to prove that $11y^{47} + \\cdots + 3 \\ge 0$ (a polynomial of degree $47$ , a long expression) for all $0 < y < 1$ . We are done.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here, I give a full solution to the ineq given by RiverLi. This solution has the advantage of being purely analytic. By \"analytic\", I mean, it is not based on any \"approximate\", \"graphic\" argument (except numeric calculations). I do try to be as clear as possible, however I do omit some explantions for some points because they're not complicated, just lengthy; in those cases, I add graphs to \"justify\". Solution Before going into details, I restate three simple facts we were able to  easily verify by hand, and a lemma that is difficult to show. $$x^x \\ge  e^{-1/e} \\qquad x^{x^{x^x}}>\\left(e^{-1/e}\\right)^{e^{1/e}} > \\underbrace{0.5877}_{=:a} \\text{ and } \\quad x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}}> (e^{-1/e})^{1/0.587}>0.5343 $$ Lemma 1 : $y \\mapsto \\frac{ \\ln( (y+1)/2)}{\\ln(y)}$ is a concave function on $(0.2,1)$ . Graph: Here Demonstration : At the end. Now we consider four different possible intervals of values of $x$ , namely $[0,0.25)$ , $[0.25, 0.5)$ , $[0.5 , 1)$ and $[1, +\\infty)$ and prove the ineq in each case. Case 1: When $x \\ge 1$ . As @RiverLi has proven previously, $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} \\ge x^x \\ge x^2-x+1 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+1)$$ Hence the inequality is true. Case 2: When $x  \\in [0, 0.25)$ , we have $$^6x> 0.534 >1/2( 0.25^2 +1) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+1)$$ So this case holds. Case 3: When $x \\in [0.5,1)$ Consider the function $f(y)=\\ln( e^y+1)$ on $(-\\infty,0)$ . Because its third derivative $f^{(3)}(y)=\\frac{e^y(1-e^y)}{ (1+e^y)^3} $ is positive, we have the following usual inequality $$\\frac{f(y)-f(z)}{y-z} \\ge f'\\left( \\frac{y+z}{2}\\right)$$ Choose $y=\\ln(x^2),z=0$ , we imply that: $$\\frac{ \\ln( (x^2+1)/2)}{\\ln(x^2)} \\ge \\frac{x}{x+1}$$ or (note that $0<x<1$ ) $$\\frac{x^2+1}{2} \\le x^{ \\frac{2x}{x+1}}$$ Besides $$^6x > x^{x^{0.5877}}= x^{  x^{0.5877}}$$ which implies the sufficiency to show $x^{0.5877} \\le \\frac{2x}{x+1}$ , or $$2 \\ge x^{0.5877} +x^{-0.4123}$$ Where the maximum of RHS on $(0.5,1)$ is easy to be analysed, which is in fact achieved at $x=1$ , thus the ineq holds.\nSee the graph here Case 4 $x \\in [0.25,0.5]$ As argued in the part 3, $^6x > x^{x^{0.5876}}$ ( I take $0.5876$ instead of $0.5877$ because it's nicer for later), it suffices to show $$\\frac{\\ln(x^2+1)-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(x)} \\ge x^{0.5876}$$ on $[0.25, 0.5]$ or $$2\\frac{\\ln(y+1)-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(y)} - y^{0.2938} \\ge 0$$ on $[0.5 ,\\sqrt{0.5} ]\\subset [0.5, 0.71]$ Indeed, we will prove the following stronger ineq  after using Bernoulli's ineq, $$2\\frac{\\ln(y+1)-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(y)}-\\left( 0.6^{p}  +p0.6^{p-1}(y-0.6) \\right)\\ge 0$$ where $p=0.2938$ Now, according to our lemma, the left fraction is concave function, which makes LHS is a summ of a concave and a linear function. Hence $LHS$ is concave. That means LHS attains minium at bord, thus $$LHS \\ge \\min( LHS_{|y=0.5},LHS_{|y=0.71})=0.007\\dots>0$$ Graph here Hence the intial ineq holds for the interval $[0.25,0.5]$ . Hence the conclusion. $\\square$ Side note : We may not use lemma 1 for the demonstration in case 4 ( just mutiplying both side by $\\ln(y)$ then analyze). However, I find this messy and tiresome to check. ----- End of solution ----------------------- Appendix : Demonstration of lemma 1 I start by demonstrating another lemma Lemma 2 $f,g$ be differentiable functions on $[a,b]$ such that $g(b)=f(b)=0$ , $g(x)> 0,g'(x) < 0$ for all $a<x<b$ , then if $x \\mapsto \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ is an decreasing function, so is $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ . Demonstration of lemma 2 Noting $h(x)= \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ , by Cauchy's MVT, there is a number $c$ lying between $(x,b)$ such that: \\begin{align}h'(x)&= \\frac{f'(x)g(x)-g'(x)f(x)}{g(x)^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}\\left( \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}- \\frac{f(x)-f(b)}{g(x)-g(b)}\\right)=\\underbrace{\\frac{g'(x)}{g(x)}}_{<0}\\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}-\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}\\right) }_{\\ge 0} \\le 0\\end{align} Hence the conclusion. Back to the demonstration of lemma 1 Note $h(x)=\\frac{ \\ln(x+1)-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(x)}$ ,it suffices to prove $h'(x)$ is decreasing. Now let's study $h$ , we have: $$h'(x)= \\underbrace{\\left( x\\ln(x)-(x+1)\\ln( \\frac{x+1}{2})\\right)}_{=:f(x)} \\frac{1}{\\underbrace{x(x+1)\\ln(x)^2}_{=g}}$$ (Check the formula's correctness here ) We see that $f(1)=0$ , $f'(x)= \\ln(x)-\\ln\\left( (x+1)/2\\right) \\le 0$ . Hence we have first conclusions that $f(x) \\ge 0$ , $h$ increasing, and $h\\le \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 1}h(x)=1/2$ The we have $g(1)=0$ and $$g'(x)=\\ln(x)(\\underbrace{2 + 2 x + \\ln(x) + 2 x \\ln(x)}_{ >0\\text{ if } x>0.2}) \\le 0$$ Besides, $$\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}=\\frac{1-\\frac{\\ln(x+1)/2}{\\ln(x)}}{2 + 2 x + \\ln(x) + 2 x \\ln(x)} =\\frac{1-h(x)}{2 + 2 x + \\ln(x) + 2 x \\ln(x)}$$ is decreasing because the nominator is decreasing and positive ( $h$ is increasing) and the denominator is increasing (by simple calculations or check graph here )\nThus based on lemma 2, $h'(x)$ is decreasing. Thus conclusion $\\square$ P/s: We can even prove that $y \\mapsto \\frac{\\ln( (y+1)/2)}{\\ln(y)}$ is concave on $(0,1)$ , not just $( 0.2,1)$ , but it is not necessary for our goal.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure the problem with Assumptions and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, the original problem is titled \"About the inequality x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} ≥ (1/2)x² + 1/2\". The user wants to prove this inequality for all x > 0. The question mentions that it was posted on MSE and is now closed. The original poster (OP) has a proof but finds it not nice, especially for the case when 0 < x < 1. They mention splitting into cases: x ≥ 1 and 0 < x < 1. For x ≥ 1, they use Bernoulli's inequality. For 0 < x < 1, they go through a series of transformations and end up needing to prove a complicated inequality involving a function f(x) and its derivative. There's a lot of detail here about the steps in their proof, but the core problem is to prove the original inequality.\n\nNow, to structure this into Assumptions and Problem. The Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is straightforward: prove the inequality for x > 0.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the main assumption is that x is a positive real number (x > 0). The problem is to prove the given inequality. The original problem doesn't specify additional constraints like x being an integer or any other conditions beyond x > 0. The user's proof splits into cases, but that's part of their approach, not the problem's assumptions. The problem itself just states x > 0. So the only assumption is that x is greater than 0.\n\nWait, but the example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the problem here, the original problem states \"Let x > 0. Prove that...\". So the assumption is x > 0. There are no other conditions given in the problem statement. The user's proof splits into cases, but those are part of their method, not the problem's assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem should have one assumption: x is greater than 0. The problem is to prove the inequality. The rest of the details in the question, like the user's proof steps, are not part of the problem's assumptions but rather their attempt.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: x is greater than 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then added another assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the assumption is only x > 0. The problem as stated doesn't have more constraints, so the assumptions section should list only that. The user's proof may involve splitting into cases (x ≥1 and 0<x<1), but those are not assumptions of the problem, just strategies for the proof. Therefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption: x is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem then had assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But that seems like maybe the user modified the problem? Wait, no. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem: Assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That would be changing the problem. Wait, maybe the example is a mistake? Or perhaps the user in the example had a different intention. Hmm, perhaps the original problem in the example had a different assumption. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that would restrict n to multiples of 7, which is not what the original problem states. So this seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is not a good one, or maybe the user intended to modify the problem. But in our current problem, we have to follow the user's instruction, even if the example is flawed.\n\nBut in our current case, the problem as stated is: Let x > 0. Prove that [inequality]. So the assumption is x > 0, and the problem is to prove the inequality. There are no other assumptions given. Therefore, the correct formatted version should have one assumption: x is greater than 0. The problem is to prove the inequality. The rest of the details in the question, like the user's proof steps, are part of their attempt and not part of the problem's assumptions.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nAssumption: x is greater than 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$x^{x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nI think that's it. The user's own proof may involve more steps and cases, but the problem itself only requires x > 0 as the assumption.",
