    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to prove that the expression 100! divided by (50! times 2^50) is an integer. The user mentioned they tried rewriting it as (51×52×…×100)/2^50 but still can't see why it's an integer. Hmm, maybe I should start by understanding what the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, let's recall that 100! means the product of all integers from 1 to 100. Then 50! is the product from 1 to 50. So when they divide 100! by 50!, they are left with the product from 51 to 100. Then they divide that by 2^50. So the expression simplifies to (51×52×…×100)/(2^50). The question is, why is this an integer?\n\nThe key here is probably to count the number of factors of 2 in the numerator and the denominator. If the numerator has at least as many factors of 2 as the denominator (which is 2^50, so 50 factors of 2), then the fraction will be an integer. So maybe I need to compute the number of factors of 2 in the product 51×52×…×100 and check if it's at least 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation. For example, 100!/(50!×2^50) could represent the number of ways to pair up 100 items into 50 pairs, divided by 50! which might account for ordering. Wait, but actually, the standard formula for the number of ways to partition 2n items into n pairs is (2n)!/(2^n n!). If we have 100 items, the number of pairings would be 100!/(2^50 50!). So the expression given is exactly that. Therefore, since the number of pairings must be an integer, the expression is an integer. That's a combinatorial argument.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an algebraic or number-theoretic proof. Let's check the number of factors of 2 in the numerator. The product 51×52×…×100 is equal to 100! / 50!. So the number of factors of 2 in the numerator is the total number of factors of 2 in 100! minus the number of factors of 2 in 50!.\n\nThe formula for the exponent of a prime p in n! is given by the sum floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + floor(n/p^3) + ... until the terms become zero.\n\nLet's compute the number of factors of 2 in 100!:\n\nfloor(100/2) = 50\n\nfloor(100/4) = 25\n\nfloor(100/8) = 12\n\nfloor(100/16) = 6\n\nfloor(100/32) = 3\n\nfloor(100/64) = 1\n\nTotal for 100! = 50+25+12+6+3+1 = 97.\n\nSimilarly for 50!:\n\nfloor(50/2) =25\n\nfloor(50/4)=12\n\nfloor(50/8)=6\n\nfloor(50/16)=3\n\nfloor(50/32)=1\n\nTotal for 50! =25+12+6+3+1=47.\n\nTherefore, the number of factors of 2 in the numerator (which is 100! / 50!) is 97 - 47 = 50. Wait, exactly 50? So then 100!/(50!×2^50) would have 50 factors of 2 in the numerator and denominator, so they cancel out, leaving an integer. But wait, does that mean the remaining factors (other primes) in the numerator are sufficient to make the entire expression an integer?\n\nWait, actually, the total number of factors of 2 in 100! is 97, and in 50! it's 47. So 97 - 47 = 50. So when you divide 100! by 50!×2^50, you're subtracting 47 and then subtracting 50 more from the exponent of 2, which totals 97 - 47 -50 = 0. So the exponent of 2 in the resulting expression is zero, meaning it's an odd integer? Wait, no, that's not possible because the remaining factors could still have other primes. Wait, no, the exponent of 2 is zero, so there are no factors of 2 left. But that doesn't necessarily mean the number is 1. It just means it's an integer with no factors of 2. So the expression is indeed an integer, but perhaps odd.\n\nBut the problem states that it's an integer, which we have proven by showing that the number of factors of 2 in the numerator and denominator are equal, so no remaining denominator for 2. However, other primes in the denominator? Wait, no. The denominator is 50!×2^50, but the original expression is 100! divided by that denominator. So 100! has enough factors in the numerator to cover both 50! and the 2^50. But we have to check for all primes, not just 2. Wait, but 50! is part of the denominator. So the expression is 100! / (50!×2^50). Since 100! includes 50! in its product (since 100! = 1×2×…×50×51×…×100), then 100! divided by 50! is 51×52×…×100. So then dividing by 2^50. So the question is whether 51×…×100 has at least 50 factors of 2.\n\nBut we calculated that the number of factors of 2 in 100! is 97, in 50! is 47, so the difference is 50. Therefore, 51×…×100 has exactly 50 factors of 2. Therefore, when we divide by 2^50, we remove all factors of 2, leaving an odd integer. Therefore, the expression is an integer. Hence, proven.\n\nAlternatively, using the combinatorial approach: the number of ways to pair 100 objects is an integer, which is exactly 100!/(2^50 50!), so that's another proof. But maybe the question expects the number-theoretic approach.\n\nIn any case, the problem is to prove that 100!/(50!×2^50) is an integer, and the key assumptions are that 100! and 50! are factorials, and the division involves 2^50. The user might have tried expanding but didn't see the connection to prime factors or combinatorial interpretations.",
