    "Content": "Obviously, there are obvious things in mathematics. Why we should prove them? Prove that $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{n}=0$? Prove that $f(x)=x$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$? $\\dotsc$ Just to list few examples.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think the answer has four parts. If you ask a random person at Walmart what $$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}$$ is, then you might not get much. If you tell them that it is $0$, then they probably won't think that it is obvious. Conversely, if you go to a high level research talk, you will hear \"It is obvious that ...\" or \"It is clear that ...\" a lot. And you might not think that it is very obvious. The point is: Whether something is obvious or not is relative to the person. Mathematics is built around proving things. There is a justification for everything. This is the very nature of mathematics. We start with some axioms and then we prove everything. So when you ask, \"Why should we prove something?\", the answer always contains: \"Because we are doing mathematics.\" You don't need much experience teaching mathematics before you meet a student who is confused about losing points on an exam because of lack of justification. Often the student will respond that they just thought that it was obvious. When you press them a bit harder it becomes clear that they, in fact, have no idea how to justify what they did. Whether or not the student arrived at the correct answer is irrelevant; the point is: if something is truly obvious, then it shouldn't be hard to prove it. If you want to get good at proving difficult things, why not get experience with proving things by starting to focus on simple or \"obvious\" things? I think that the experience gained from proving even simple propositions is valuable later in your career as a mathematician.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question provided. Let me first read through the original content carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Why should we prove obvious things?\" and the question asks why we should prove things that seem obvious, giving examples like proving the limit of 1/n as n approaches infinity is 0, proving that f(x)=x is continuous on R, etc.\n\nMy task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement following the given format. The example provided lists assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then states the problem.\n\nLooking at the examples given in the question: proving lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0 and proving f(x)=x is continuous on ℝ. These are both specific problems. The user is asking why such proofs are necessary even when the results seem obvious.\n\nTo format this into the required structure, the problem part would be to prove those statements. The assumptions would be the conditions under which these proofs hold. For the limit example, the assumption would be that n approaches infinity. For the continuity of f(x)=x, the assumption is that the function is defined on the real numbers. Each assumption should be on a separate line.\n\nWait, but in the original example given by the user, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the limit and continuity. The assumptions for each problem would be:\n\nFor the limit: n is an integer approaching infinity. Wait, but in the definition of the limit as n approaches infinity, n is typically a positive integer (if considering sequences), but formally, in real analysis, it's a continuous variable. However, the function 1/n as a sequence (discrete n) would have n as a positive integer. So maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But the problem statement as given is to prove lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0, which is standard. So the assumption here might be that n is a positive integer, or that it's a real number approaching infinity. Hmm, but maybe the question is more general. Since the user is asking why we need to prove these, the exact assumptions might just be the context in which these statements are made.\n\nWait, the original example had the problem statement with the function A(n) and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a condition on the object in the problem. So for the first example, proving the limit of 1/n is 0, the assumption would be that n approaches infinity. But the problem is to prove that limit. However, the structure requires listing all assumptions. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is \"Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0\" and \"Prove that f(x)=x is continuous on ℝ\". The assumptions for these would be:\n\nFor the limit: The sequence is defined for all positive integers n, and n approaches infinity. Or maybe that 1/n is a function from natural numbers to real numbers. But perhaps the key assumption is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, in real analysis, limits as n approaches infinity can also be for functions defined on the real numbers. But since the expression is 1/n, which is more commonly a sequence when n is an integer, maybe the assumption is that n is a positive integer.\n\nBut the problem statement just says \"Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0\". To structure this, the assumption would be that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. Similarly, for the continuity of f(x)=x, the assumption is that f is defined on ℝ.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions as two separate lines: \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by $7$\". So each condition is a separate line. So for each problem, the assumptions need to be broken down into individual properties.\n\nSo for the limit problem:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nAssumption: n approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, in the original example, the problem was about divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition on the same object. In this case, for the limit problem, the main object is n, which is a positive integer (assuming it's a sequence), and the limit is taken as n approaches infinity. But the limit's definition doesn't require n to be an integer, unless specified. Wait, but in the context of sequences, n is an integer. If it's a function over the reals, then n would be a real variable. However, the expression 1/n is often treated as a sequence when written with n, implying integer n.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions for the limit problem are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut how to phrase each as a separate assumption. Alternatively, maybe:\n\n- The variable n represents a positive integer.\n\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the limit is already given as n→∞. So maybe the first assumption is that n is a positive integer. Then the problem is to prove the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, for the continuity of f(x)=x on ℝ, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = x for all real numbers x.\n\n- The continuity is considered on the entire set of real numbers.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: f(x) = x for all real numbers x.\n\nAssumption: Continuity is evaluated on the domain ℝ.\n\nTherefore, the problem statements would be:\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = x is continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut the original question in the example includes both problems. However, the user's example had one problem. The current question lists two separate example problems. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the format. The original question on Math SE is asking why we need to prove such \"obvious\" things, and gives those two examples. So the task is to extract the specific problems mentioned and structure them with their assumptions.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the actual problem to structure is the one in the Title and Question. The Title is \"Why should we prove obvious things?\" and the Question gives examples of proofs, like proving lim 1/n =0 and f(x)=x is continuous. The user wants to structure those example problems, not the meta-question about why prove them. So perhaps each example problem is a separate instance. But the user's example only had one problem. The current case has two problems mentioned. So perhaps we need to structure each example problem separately. However, the user's example structured the original problem (about A(n) divisible by 91) into one problem. So maybe in this case, each example given in the question is a separate problem. But the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem\" (singular). So perhaps the main problem is the meta-question, but the examples are the specific problems. But the formatting requires a problem part, which would be to prove those statements. But the original question is not asking for the proof, but why proofs are necessary. However, the user wants to extract the specific mathematical problems from the question and structure them. So in this case, the answer should present each of the example problems in the required format. But the user's example only had one problem. Maybe the assistant is supposed to pick one of them, but the question mentions two: the limit and the continuity. Alternatively, maybe the problem part is to ask why proofs are needed, but that's not a mathematical problem to solve. The user's example took a problem asking to prove something and structured it. So perhaps the actual mathematical problems to structure are the two examples given: proving the limit and proving continuity. But the original question is about why we need to prove them. But the task is to filter the unrelated information and structure the problem. So the actual mathematical problems are the ones mentioned: proving the limit and continuity. So perhaps each should be structured separately. However, the user's example had one problem. Maybe in this case, the answer should present both problems, each in their own format. But the original problem in the example was a single problem. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem mentioned in the question should be formatted. But how does the example handle multiple problems? The example had one problem. The current case has two. Maybe the answer should list both, each with their own assumptions and problem statements. But the user's format example has one problem. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should pick one. However, the user's instruction says to \"structure that problem\" (singular), but the question has multiple. Perhaps the correct approach is to structure each example problem separately. So for each example given in the question, create a formatted entry. But the user's example only has one. Maybe the answer should have two separate entries. However, the user hasn't specified. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is to structure each example as a separate problem. Therefore, the assistant should process each of the example problems mentioned in the Math SE question.\n\nBut looking back at the user's example: the original problem had a single mathematical statement to prove. The formatted version listed the assumptions and the problem. Here, the Math SE question mentions two examples: proving the limit and proving the continuity. So each of these is a separate problem. Hence, the answer should present two formatted entries. However, the user's example only had one. But since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem\", perhaps the assistant is supposed to pick one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the problem part includes both. But the example shows one problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the assistant should structure each example as a separate problem. So:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption: f(x) = x for all real numbers x.\n\nProblem: Prove that f is continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut in the original question, the user's example had assumptions listed as separate lines. For instance, n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line. So for the limit problem, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\n- The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, for the continuity problem:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = x.\n\n- The domain of f is ℝ.\n\nBut the problem statements would then be to prove the respective statements under those assumptions. However, in the limit case, the expression 1/n with n approaching infinity is standard, and the assumption that n is a positive integer is implicit in sequence limits. But perhaps for rigor, we need to state those assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the limit problem, the assumption is that n is a natural number, since the limit of a sequence. But in real analysis, the limit as n approaches infinity of 1/n where n is a real variable would also be 0. However, the notation might differ. So perhaps the key assumption is that n is a natural number. But the problem as stated is to prove lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0, which could be in the context of real numbers or sequences. The problem statement doesn't specify. Hence, to be precise, the assumption should clarify the context.\n\nBut since the original question is about why we need to prove such \"obvious\" things, the answer would structure the problem with the necessary assumptions. So for each example:\n\nFirst example: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- n is a natural number (i.e., positive integer).\n\n- The limit is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.\n\nSecond example: Prove that f(x) = x is continuous on ℝ.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- f is defined by f(x) = x for all real x.\n\n- The continuity is evaluated on the entire set of real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = x is continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut the user's example had assumptions listed as separate lines, each for one property. So each assumption line addresses one property of one object. So for the first problem:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nAssumption: The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.\n\nFor the second problem:\n\nAssumption: f(x) is defined as x for all real numbers x.\n\nAssumption: The domain of f is the set of real numbers.\n\nProblem: Prove that f(x) = x is continuous on ℝ.\n\nBut in the continuity problem, the function is defined on ℝ, so the assumptions are that f is defined as x and the domain is ℝ. However, continuity is a property that depends on the domain, so specifying the domain is important.\n\nBut perhaps for the continuity problem, the main assumption is that the domain is ℝ, and the function is f(x) = x. So two assumptions.\n\nHowever, the original example in the user's instruction had two assumptions about the same object (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, for the continuity problem, the function is defined as x (one assumption) and the domain is ℝ (another assumption). Similarly, for the limit problem, n is a natural number (one assumption), and the limit is as n approaches infinity (another assumption). \n\nTherefore, the formatted problems would be:\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumption: n is a natural number.\n\nAssumption: The limit is taken as n approaches infinity.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{n}=0$$.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumption: f(x) = x for all real numbers x.\n\nAssumption: The domain of f is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $f(x)=x$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBut the original question on Math SE is asking why we should prove these things. The task is to structure the problem(s) mentioned in the question, which are these two examples. However, the user's example structured one problem. So perhaps the assistant should present both problems in the answer. But the user's format example has one problem. Given that, maybe the answer should list both problems separately. However, the user might expect each example to be formatted individually. Since the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", and the original question contains two problems, perhaps the answer should present both in the same format, each under their own ###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT### sections. But the user's example only had one. Alternatively, maybe the answer should select one of them. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is to format each example problem as a separate entry. But the user hasn't specified. To align with the example, maybe the answer should pick one. However, since both are mentioned, perhaps the answer should include both. Given that, here's the final answer.",
