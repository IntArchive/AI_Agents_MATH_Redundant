    "Content": "I am working on a question for my number theory class that asks: Prove that for every integer $n \\geq 1$, $\\phi(n) \\geq \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{2}}$. However, I was searching around Google, and on various websites I have found people explaining that the phi function has a defined upper bound, but no lower bound. Am I reading these sites incorrectly, or am I missing something in the problem itself?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let me begin with the explicit lower bound at LOWER , $$ \\phi(n) > \\frac{n}{e^\\gamma \\log \\log n + \\frac{3}{\\log \\log n}}  $$ for $n>2.$ and then do your easier result separately.  It is a procedure due to Ramanujan, in that we can explicitly find, for any $1 > \\delta > 0,$ the integer that gives the minimum of $$  \\frac{\\phi(n)}{n^{1-\\delta}}  $$ My memory is that the optima always occur at primorials, but I will need to check. Oh, before I forget, it is theorem 327 on page 267 of Hardy and Wright that the fraction goes to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity, so it does attain a minimum. Alright, checked, the minimum occurs at the primorial $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdots p,$ the product of consecutive primes, where the $p$ is that largest prime that satisfies $$  p - 1 \\leq p^{1 - \\delta}.  $$ So, with $\\delta = 1/2,$ we find $2 - 1 \\leq \\sqrt 2,$ but $3-1 > \\sqrt 3,$ so the minimum of $$  \\frac{\\phi(n)}{\\sqrt n}  $$ occurs at $n=2$ and $$  \\phi(n) \\geq \\sqrt{ \\frac{n}{ 2} }.  $$ With $\\delta = \\log (3/2) / \\log 3 = 0.36907\\ldots,$ we find $3 - 1 \\leq 3^{1-\\delta},$ so the minimum of $$  \\frac{\\phi(n)}{n^{0.63092975\\ldots}}  $$ occurs at $n=2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ and $$  \\frac{\\phi(n)}{n^{0.63092975\\ldots}} \\geq  \\frac{2}{6^{0.63092975\\ldots}} = 0.645760\\ldots.  $$ It is not quite optimal, but prettier. Take $\\delta = 1/3,$ we get $$  \\frac{\\phi(n)}{n^{2/3}} \\geq  \\frac{2}{6^{2/3}}.  $$ $$ \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc  \\bigcirc   $$ We already had, with $\\delta = 1/2,$ $$  \\phi(n) \\geq \\sqrt{ \\frac{n}{ 2} }.  $$ With $\\delta = 1/3,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 2 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{6} \\right)^{2/3}.  $$ Take $\\delta = 1/8,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 8 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{30} \\right)^{7/8}.  $$ Take $\\delta = 1/13,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 48 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{210} \\right)^{12/13}.  $$ Take $\\delta = 1/26,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 480 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{2310} \\right)^{25/26}.  $$ Take $\\delta = 1/33,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 5760 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{30030} \\right)^{32/33}.  $$ Take $\\delta = 1/47,$ we get $$  \\phi(n) \\geq 92160 \\cdot   \\left( \\frac{n}{510510} \\right)^{46/47}.  $$ This is exactly the same procedure used in Ramanujan's Superior Highly Composite numbers and Alaoglu and Erdos' Colossally Abundant numbers, but I'm not sure I know anywhere that shows how you get the primorials. EDIT: I put a proof as a separate answer, also give reference for the relationship to the Riemann Hypothesis, due to Jean-Louis Nicolas.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to their specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The user mentions a problem from their number theory class: Prove that for every integer n ≥ 1, φ(n) ≥ √n / √2. But they found online sources saying that Euler's phi function has a defined upper bound but no lower bound, which seems contradictory. They're confused whether they misread the problem or the websites.\n\nMy task is to structure this problem into the Assumption and Problem sections as per the example. Let me recall the example given. The original problem had assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property. The problem was then restated concisely.\n\nLooking at the user's problem, the main assumptions would be about n being an integer and n being greater than or equal to 1. The problem is to prove the inequality involving the phi function. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user mentions \"for every integer n ≥ 1\", so those are the two conditions. The confusion about lower bounds might not be part of the problem itself but the user's additional context. Since the task is to filter unrelated information and structure the problem, I need to extract the core problem and its assumptions.\n\nSo, the assumptions are:\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n ≥ 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that φ(n) ≥ √n / √2 for every such n.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, sometimes additional constraints are listed as assumptions. Here, the problem states \"for every integer n ≥ 1\", so those are the two separate conditions. The user's confusion about lower bounds is part of their thought process but not part of the problem's assumptions. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions should just be n being an integer and n being at least 1. The problem is to prove the inequality.\n\nLet me check the example again. The original example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. So each assumption is a separate line, even if they both apply to the same object (n). In the user's problem, \"for every integer n ≥ 1\" translates to two assumptions: n is integer and n ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those two assumptions and the problem statement as given. The user's additional context about conflicting information online is just their own confusion and not part of the problem's structure. So I need to extract only the problem's core.",
