    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving a limit involving a product of numbers from (n+1) to 2n, then taking the nth root, dividing by n, and finding the limit as n approaches infinity. The user wants me to extract assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The problem mentions the limit as n approaches infinity, so n is a positive integer going to infinity. The expression inside the nth root is the product (n+1)(n+2)...2n. That product is equivalent to (2n)! / n! because it's the product from 1 to 2n divided by the product from 1 to n. However, the original problem doesn't state any specific conditions on n except that it's going to infinity, which in the context of limits, n is typically a positive integer. So the main assumption here is that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. But the problem doesn't have additional constraints like divisibility or specific ranges beyond n being in the natural numbers for the product to make sense.\n\nWait, the example given in the original query had an assumption where n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this current problem, there's no such divisibility condition. So maybe the only assumption here is that n is a positive integer. However, sometimes in limits involving sequences, n is implicitly a positive integer, but maybe it's better to state that explicitly. Let me check the problem again. The user wrote the limit as n approaches infinity, and the product is from n+1 to 2n, which requires n to be an integer to make sense of the product terms. So yes, n must be a positive integer. So the assumption is that n is a positive integer. But the problem statement itself is asking for the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the nth root of that product. \n\nSo putting this together, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim _{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n} \\sqrt[n]{(n+1)(n+2) \\cdots 2n} = \\frac{4}{e}.$$\n\nWait, but the example given had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in this case, there's only one assumption needed: n is a positive integer. Since the product (n+1)...2n only makes sense when n is an integer, otherwise the product terms wouldn't be defined in sequence. So maybe that's the only assumption here. Therefore, the formatted problem should list that n is a positive integer as the assumption, and the problem is to prove the limit equals 4/e.",
