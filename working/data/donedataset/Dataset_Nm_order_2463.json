    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title is \"Approximation of combination $ {n \\choose k} = \\Theta \\left( n^k \\right) $?\" and the question asks if it's valid to state that the binomial coefficient is Theta of n^k for any n and k, with the note that k is not a function of n. They also mention a reference to a PDF where this was observed.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem statement mentions two variables, n and k. The key points here are:\n\n1. The problem is about the asymptotic notation Big Theta (Θ) for the binomial coefficient {n choose k} compared to n^k.\n2. The variables n and k are given, but there's a specific note that k is not a function of n. This is crucial because if k were a function of n (like k = n/2), the analysis might differ.\n3. The question is whether the relationship holds \"for any n and k\", but with the constraint that k is not dependent on n. However, I need to check if there are implicit assumptions here. For example, typically in asymptotic analysis, we consider n approaching infinity, so maybe n is large. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. However, Big Theta notation is about asymptotic behavior, so maybe that's an implicit assumption. But the original problem statement doesn't mention asymptotic, just the approximation. Wait, the title says \"approximation\", and the user wrote \"Note: k is not a function of n\".\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for any n and k\", but in asymptotic notation like Theta, we usually consider behavior as some variable tends to infinity. So perhaps there's an implicit assumption here that n is growing, and k is fixed (since it's not a function of n). Alternatively, maybe k can vary but not as a function of n. Hmm, but how can k not be a function of n if both are variables? Maybe the assumption is that k is a constant independent of n. Wait, the note says \"k is not a function of n\", meaning that when considering the asymptotics as n grows, k remains a fixed constant. That's a common scenario where k is fixed and n tends to infinity. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a constant (not a function of n).\n- The asymptotic analysis is as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention asymptotic behavior, only the approximation. However, since Theta notation is an asymptotic notation, that's implied. So the user might be asking if {n choose k} is Theta(n^k) when k is a fixed constant (not depending on n) as n becomes large.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that k is a fixed constant (not varying with n), and the analysis is for n approaching infinity. However, in the problem statement, they just say \"for any n and k\" but with the note that k is not a function of n. So maybe the key assumption here is that k is a fixed integer, independent of n. So in the assumptions, I should list:\n\n1. k is an integer.\n2. k is a constant (not a function of n).\n3. n is an integer.\n4. The problem concerns asymptotic behavior as n approaches infinity (since Theta notation is asymptotic). But does the original problem explicitly state that? The title says \"approximation\", which could be in terms of asymptotics. However, the user's note only says \"k is not a function of n\", so perhaps the main assumptions are that k is fixed, and n is variable, tending to infinity. But since the problem is to prove {n choose k} = Θ(n^k), which is an asymptotic statement, that's implied.\n\nLooking back at the example provided, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the problem statement didn't mention divisibility by 7. Wait, no. Wait, the example was a problem where the user wrote \"for every integer n\", but then the formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems odd. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, perhaps that was an error in the example. Let me check.\n\nOriginal problem in the example: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would include all integers, not just those divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Because if the problem states \"for every integer n\", then there's no restriction, so the assumption would just be \"n is an integer\". But the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which contradicts the original problem's statement. So perhaps there's an error there. But in any case, maybe the example is not perfectly illustrative.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The user's question is whether {n choose k} is Θ(n^k) for any n and k, with k not a function of n. So, assumptions would need to be:\n\n- k is a non-negative integer (since binomial coefficients are defined for non-negative integers k ≤ n).\n- n is a positive integer with n ≥ k (since {n choose k} is zero otherwise, but if k is fixed and n grows, eventually n ≥ k).\n- k is a constant independent of n (i.e., fixed as n increases).\n\nBut the problem is about asymptotic behavior, so perhaps the assumption is that n approaches infinity while k is fixed. So the key assumptions would be:\n\n1. k is a fixed non-negative integer.\n2. n is a positive integer such that n ≥ k.\n3. The asymptotic analysis is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"for any n and k\", but with the note that k is not a function of n. So perhaps the user is considering k as a fixed constant, not varying with n, but n can be any integer larger than k. Therefore, the assumptions should capture that k is fixed, and n is allowed to grow. The problem is to show that {n choose k} is Θ(n^k) under these conditions.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- k is a fixed non-negative integer.\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n approaches infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't explicitly say n approaches infinity, but since Theta notation is asymptotic, it's implied. Therefore, the formatted problem's assumptions should list that k is fixed (not a function of n), and n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, according to the example, each assumption line should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption lines:\n\n1. k is a non-negative integer.\n2. k is a fixed constant (not dependent on n).\n3. n is a positive integer.\n4. n approaches infinity.\n\nBut perhaps the first and third lines can be merged if the problem defines n and k as integers. But in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" as one line. So following that structure:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is a fixed constant (not dependent on n),\nn is a positive integer,\nthe asymptotic behavior is considered as n approaches infinity.\n\nBut maybe the last part is redundant if we state that n approaches infinity. However, in the example, the assumption was about divisibility by 7, which was part of the problem's conditions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". Wait, that example seems contradictory. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is actually a restriction not present in the original problem. That must be a mistake. So perhaps the example is not a good guide. But in any case, following the instructions, each assumption should be a single condition on one object.\n\nSo for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- k is a non-negative integer.\n- k is a fixed constant (independent of n).\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBecause the problem says \"for any n and k\", but with k not a function of n, so k is fixed. The asymptotic part is inherent in the Theta notation. So perhaps the assumption that n approaches infinity is implied and doesn't need to be listed as a separate line. But the example didn't include asymptotic conditions, so maybe the user wants explicit listing. However, in the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. So that example might be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I should focus on the user's note and the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"Note: k is not a function of n.\" So the key assumption is that k is fixed. Also, since we are dealing with binomial coefficients, k must be a non-negative integer not exceeding n. But if k is fixed and n approaches infinity, then for sufficiently large n, n ≥ k, so that's okay. So the main assumptions are:\n\n1. k is a non-negative integer.\n2. k is a fixed constant (independent of n).\n3. n is a positive integer with n ≥ k.\n\nBut the problem is about the asymptotic behavior as n grows, so perhaps we need to include that n approaches infinity. However, in the problem statement, it's phrased as \"for any n and k\", but with k fixed. So maybe the assumption is that k is fixed, and n is any integer greater than or equal to k, but for the asymptotic analysis, we consider n → ∞. But how to phrase that in the assumption lines.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show that {n \\choose k} = Θ(n^k), which is an asymptotic statement, the assumption would naturally involve n approaching infinity. But the user might not have stated that explicitly. So, per the example, where assumptions were listed even if not all were in the original problem, perhaps I should list:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is a fixed constant (independent of n),\nn is a positive integer,\nn is sufficiently large (n → ∞).\n\nBut the example didn't include asymptotic conditions, but in the example, the user had an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Maybe that was a mistake, but in this case, the problem is about asymptotic notation, so n approaching infinity is inherent. However, the original problem's note only specifies that k is not a function of n. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- k is a fixed non-negative integer.\n- n is a positive integer (with n ≥ k, but this is implied when k is fixed and n grows).\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is a fixed constant (independent of n),\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $ {n \\choose k} = \\Theta \\left( n^k \\right) $.\n\nBut I need to check if these assumptions are sufficient. For example, {n \\choose k} is approximately n^k / k! when n is large and k is fixed, which is Θ(n^k). So the key is that k is fixed. So the main assumptions are that k is fixed and not varying with n, and n is a positive integer (approaching infinity, but that's part of the asymptotic analysis inherent in Big Theta).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a non-negative integer,\nk is a fixed constant (independent of n),\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $ {n \\choose k} = \\Theta \\left( n^k \\right) $.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number [...] is divisible by 91.\" The formatted assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. But the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe the example is flawed, possibly mixing up the problem's conclusion (divisible by 91, which is 7*13) with the assumptions. So maybe in that example, there was a mistake, and the correct assumptions should have been \"n is an integer\", without the divisibility by 7. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nGiven that, the correct assumptions here are that k is a fixed non-negative integer and n is a positive integer. The problem is to prove the asymptotic equivalence.",
