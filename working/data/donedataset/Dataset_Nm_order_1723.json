    "AcceptedAnswer": "Proving the contrapositive statement seems cleaner to me. Suppose $\\sum{a_n\\over 1+{a_n}}$ converges. Then ${a_n\\over 1+{a_n}}\\rightarrow 0$. This implies that ${a_n}$ is eventually less than one, so ${a_n\\over2}\\le {a_n\\over a_n+1}$ for $n$ sufficiently large. The comparision test then shows that $\\sum a_n$ converges.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given math problem into the specified format. First, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem states that if a positive series ∑aₙ diverges, then the series ∑(aₙ/(1 + aₙ)) also diverges. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the key is to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The original problem mentions two main things: the series is positive, and it diverges. So the assumptions should be that each term aₙ is positive (since it's a positive series) and that the sum of aₙ is infinity (i.e., diverges). \n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Here, the problem is about series, so the assumptions are about the series properties. The problem states it's a positive series, meaning each aₙ is positive. Then, the sum of aₙ is given as +infty, which means divergence. So those are two separate assumptions.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is on a separate line. The problem part is to prove that the modified series diverges. So putting it all together, the assumptions are:\n\n1. For all n ≥ 1, aₙ is positive.\n2. The series ∑_{n≥1} aₙ diverges (equals +infty).\n\nThen the problem is to prove that ∑_{n≥1} aₙ/(1 + aₙ) also diverges. \n\nI should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original problem says \"positive series\", which typically means each term is positive. So that's covered. The example given by the user had two assumptions, and here we also have two. Each is a single property applied to the series terms. So this should fit the format.",
