    "Content": "In analysis we often use test functions $\\phi\\in C_{0}^{\\infty}(U)$ in order to make some kind of deduction about another function $u:U\\mapsto\\mathbb{C}$. For example, if one can obtain the conclusion\n$\\int_{U}u\\phi\\;dx=0$ for every $\\phi$, then we can conclude $u\\equiv0$ in $U$. I have a couple of questions though.  Integration by parts very often comes up in situations involving test functions, and the fact that they are compactly supported allows you to throw out the boundary integrals.  I can see why this is justified when the set $U$ is open, but if $U$ is closed or compact, can we use test functions in the same way?  Or do we really need to restrict ourselves to open domains? My other question has to do with an exercise I'm working on.  It asks us to define a weakly harmonic function as one which satisfies\n$$\\int_{U}u\\Delta\\phi\\;dx=0,$$\nand asks us to prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic:\n$\\Delta u=0$.  Actually, we are allowed to assume $u$ is continuous in $U$, even though the result is true for more general $u\\in L^{1}_{loc}(U)$.  But after proving this, it struck me that the above logic that I've used in various other instances seems contradictory to the present situation.  Applying that logic to the weakly-harmonic condition should imply that $u=0$, since $\\Delta\\phi$ is more or less an arbitrary function anyway, right? How do you resolve this? With the above questions resolved by Jose's answer (see below), I figured I would go ahead and post a proof to the claim that weak solutions to Laplace's equation are indeed classical solutions, at least under the hypothesis that the weak solution is $\\mathscr{C}^{2}(\\bar{U})$, and later merely $\\mathscr{C}(U)$.  Of course, much of what is presented in the proof generalizes.  Indeed, the first part of the proof is to show that the ''standard'' mollification of a weak harmonic solution is in fact harmonic; by using the concept of an adjoint, it is not difficult to extend my argument to general linear PDE, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  Of course, what follows from there is unique to Laplace's equation $\\Delta u=0$; in particular due to the standard mollifier $$\\eta_{\\epsilon}=\\frac{C}{\\epsilon^{n}}e^{\\frac{1}{|x|^{2}-1}}$$ being radial symmetric and harmonic functions satisfying the important mean-value properties.  Going one step further, one can easily deduce the theorem for arbitrary weak solutions in $L^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{n},\\mathscr{L},\\mu)$, at least after redefining such a function on a set of measure zero. (Note that any arcane reference's to \"appendix,\" \"text,\" etc. refers to Evan's PDE text, though this particular theorem does not appear in the text; not even as an exercise.) Proof. Let's first assume $u\\in\\mathscr{C}^{2}(\\bar{U}).$  Then integration by parts (or Green's identity) shows\n\\begin{align*}\n0\n&=\\int\\limits_{U}u\\Delta\\phi\\;dx\\\\\n&=\\int\\limits_{\\partial U}u\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\nu}\\;dS-\\int\\limits_{U}\\nabla u\\cdot\\nabla\\phi\\;dx\\\\\n&=-\\int\\limits_{\\partial U}\\phi\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial\\nu}\\;dS+\\int\\limits_{U}\\phi\\Delta u\\;dx\\\\\n&=\\int\\limits_{U}\\phi\\Delta u\\;dx.\n\\end{align*}\nConversely, it is easy to see from the above that if $u$ is harmonic in $U$, then $u$ is also weakly harmonic.  Thus, being a weak solution to $\\Delta u=0$ is equivalent to being a classical solution, at least when $u\\in\\mathscr{C}^{2}(\\bar{U}).$  We now strengthen the assertion by assuming only $u\\in\\mathscr{C}(U)$ and mollifying $u$ (with the standard radial mollifier $\\eta_{\\epsilon}$ as defined in the appendix) in order to work again with a sufficiently smooth function.  To that end, let $\\epsilon>0$ be given and define the set\n$$U_{\\epsilon}:=\\{x\\in U\\;:\\;\\text{dist}(x,\\partial U)>\\epsilon\\}.$$\n(The set $U_{\\epsilon}$ is obtained by cutting out a wedge of width $\\epsilon$ along the perimeter of $U$).  Since the function $\\eta_{\\epsilon}(y)$ is supported on $B(0,\\epsilon)$, we find that for any $x\\in U_{\\epsilon}$ fixed, $\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)$ is compactly supported in $U$ (in particular, on $B(x,\\epsilon)$) and as such (as a function of $y$), $$\\psi(y):=\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)\\in\\mathscr{C}^{\\infty}_{0}(U).$$  For fixed $x\\in U_{\\epsilon}$, we then compute\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta u_{\\epsilon}(x)\n&=\\Delta_{x}(\\eta_{\\epsilon}\\star u)\\\\\n&=\\Delta_{x}\\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)u(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\Delta_{x}\\int\\limits_{U}\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)u(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\int\\limits_{U}\\Delta_{x}\\Big[\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)\\Big]u(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\int\\limits_{U}(-1)^{2}\\Delta_{y}\\Big[\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)\\Big]u(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\int\\limits_{U}u\\Delta\\psi\\;dy\\\\\n&=0.\n\\end{align}\nLine 3 follows from $\\text{supp}\\{\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)\\}\\subset U$ as discussed above.  Differentiation under the integral sign in line 4 is justified by continuity of both $u$ and continuous differentiability of $\\eta_{\\epsilon}(x-y)$ as a function of $x$.  Line 5 follows from the chain rule, and finally line 7 follows from $u$ being a weak solution to $\\Delta u=0$ and the previous remarks.  We have just proved that the mollified version of the weak solution to $\\Delta w=0$ is a classical solution in the restricted domain $U_{\\epsilon}$:\n$$\\int\\limits_{U}u\\Delta\\phi\\;dx=0\\;\\forall\\;\\phi\\in\\mathscr{C}^{\\infty}_{0}(U)\\Longrightarrow \\Delta u_{\\epsilon}=0\\;\\text{in}\\;U_{\\epsilon}$$\nfor all $\\epsilon>0$.  We now show that this fact actually implies $\\Delta u=0$ in $U$. Now choose $\\epsilon'>0$ and put\n$$u_{\\epsilon\\epsilon'}:=\\eta_{\\epsilon'}\\star u_{\\epsilon}.$$  Note that $\\eta_{\\epsilon'}(x-y)$ is supported on $U_{\\epsilon}$ whenever $x\\in U_{\\epsilon+\\epsilon'}$; in particular, for a fixed $x\\in U_{\\epsilon+\\epsilon'}$, $\\eta_{\\epsilon'}(x-y)$ is supported on $B(x,\\epsilon')$.  Since $\\eta_{\\epsilon'}$ is radial and $u_{\\epsilon}$ is harmonic in $U_{\\epsilon+\\epsilon'}$ (and thus satisfies the mean-value properties there), for such $x$ fixed we compute in polar coordinates (as in Theorem 6 in the text)\n\\begin{align*}\nu_{\\epsilon\\epsilon'}(x)\n&=\\int\\limits_{U_{\\epsilon}}\\eta_{\\epsilon'}(x-y)u_{\\epsilon}(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon'^{n}}\\int\\limits_{B(x,\\epsilon')}\\eta\\left(\\frac{|x-y|}{\\epsilon'}\\right)u_{\\epsilon}(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon'^{n}}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\epsilon'}\\eta\\left(\\frac{r}{\\epsilon'}\\right)\\left(\\int\\limits_{\\partial B(x,r)}u_{\\epsilon}(y)\\;dS(y)\\right)dr\\\\\n&=\\frac{u_{\\epsilon}(x)n\\alpha(n)}{\\epsilon'^{n}}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\epsilon'}r^{n-1}\\eta\\left(\\frac{r}{\\epsilon'}\\right)\\;dr\\\\\n&=\\frac{u_{\\epsilon}(x)}{\\epsilon'^{n}}\\int\\limits_{B(x,\\epsilon)}\\eta\\left(\\frac{x-y}{\\epsilon'}\\right)\\;dy\\\\\n&=u_{\\epsilon}(x)\\int\\limits_{B(0,\\epsilon)}\\eta_{\\epsilon}(y)\\;dy\\\\\n&=u_{\\epsilon}(x).\n\\end{align*}\nSince convolution is associative, we find that for $x\\in U_{\\epsilon+\\epsilon'}$,\n$$u_{\\epsilon'\\epsilon}(x)=u_{\\epsilon\\epsilon'}(x)=u_{\\epsilon}(x)\\to u(x)\\;\\text{uniformly as}\\;\\epsilon\\to0,$$\nor\n$$u(x)=u_{\\epsilon'}(x).$$  From what was proven above, $u_{\\epsilon'}$ is harmonic in $U_{\\epsilon'}$, and therefore so is $u(x)$.  Sending $\\epsilon'\\to0$, we obtain the result for all $x\\in U$, and conclude that weak solutions to Laplace's equation are in fact smooth solutions in the classical sense. QED (Here is an alternative argument to finish off the proof that $\\Delta u=0$ in $U$, though it is not quite rigorous and may actually be incorrect): Now, $\\Delta u_{\\epsilon}\\to0$ uniformly as $\\epsilon\\to0$ in any compact subset of $U$, and therefore, $\\nabla u_{\\epsilon}$ and $\\nabla^{2}u_{\\epsilon}$ must both converge uniformly to some limit in the same compact subset.  Consequently, since $u_{\\epsilon}\\to u$ pointwise for at least one $x\\in U$ (in fact, uniformly for all $x$ in any $V\\subset\\subset U$), we find $\\Delta u$ exists, and $$\\Delta u=\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0^{+}}\\Delta u_{\\epsilon}=0$$ as required.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "For the first question consider the case of a compact set with empty interior $K$, how do you define a differentiable function there? On the other hand if $K=\\bar{U}$ the closure of an open set with some properties then the space $C_c^\\infty(K)= \\{ f : K \\to \\mathbb{C} : \\text{supp}(f) \\subset K \\text{ and is compact }\\}$ is completely analogous to the case of $U$, with the not-so-minor detail that functions in this space might be non-zero arbitrarily close to the boundary. The second question is a somewhat subtle one: Indeed for every $\\psi \\in C_c^\\infty(U)$ we can find $\\phi$ such that $\\Delta \\phi =\\psi$ in $U$, but we can't assert that $\\phi$ has compact support. Think of the case $U=\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\psi\\geq 0$ then the usual way to obtain a (bounded) solution is to take $\\phi = \\psi* \\Phi$ where $\\Phi$ is the fundamental solution of the Laplacian and you can check that if $\\psi$ is positive in an open ball then $\\phi$ never vanishes. To see this more clearly think of the case $n=1$ and the derivative instead of the Laplacian: Prove that if $u$ is a continuous function such that for every $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}) $\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} u\\varphi' =0\n$$\nthen $u$ is constant. (The argument in this case being that, unless $\\varphi$ has zero average, the usual way of building the antiderivative $\\psi=\\int_{-\\infty}^x \\varphi(t)dt $ will not produce an admissible function, i.e. $\\psi\\notin C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$.) I guess what I'm trying to get at is that $\\Delta \\phi$ is not so arbitrary. Hope this helps.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to parse this Math Stack Exchange question and format it according to the user's specifications. Let me start by reading through the original problem carefully.\n\nThe title mentions \"Weakly Harmonic Functions (Weak Solutions to Laplace's Equation Δu=0) and Logic of Test Function Techniques.\" The user has a couple of questions. The first one is about using test functions on closed or compact domains versus open domains. The second question is about an exercise where they need to show that weakly harmonic functions (defined via an integral condition) are equivalent to classical harmonic functions. There's also a confusion about why the logic that usually implies u=0 doesn't apply here.\n\nThe user then proceeds to provide a detailed proof of the claim that weak solutions are classical solutions, assuming continuity and using mollifiers. They also mention an alternative argument at the end.\n\nNow, according to the format, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem. The example given shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is stated.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted version listed assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7, then the problem statement.\n\nIn the current case, the main problem the user is working on is to prove that a weakly harmonic function (satisfying the integral condition) is equivalent to being harmonic (Δu=0). The assumptions here would relate to the conditions on u and the domain U.\n\nFrom the problem description:\n\n- The user is allowed to assume u is continuous in U (though the result is true for more general u in L^1_loc).\n- The problem is to prove the equivalence between the weak and classical solutions.\n- The user mentions using test functions ϕ in C0^∞(U), which are compactly supported smooth functions.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nu is a weakly harmonic function, i.e., ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0 for all ϕ ∈ C0^∞(U),\nu is continuous in U,\nU is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n\nWait, the user initially questions whether U being closed or compact affects the use of test functions. In the problem statement, they later work with U being open because test functions are compactly supported in open sets. The assumption here is that U is open, as test functions are typically defined on open domains. Also, in the proof, they use U_ε which requires distance to the boundary, implying U is open.\n\nSo, the key assumptions for the problem are:\n\n- u is continuous in U.\n- The integral condition holds for all test functions ϕ in C0^∞(U).\n- U is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n\nThe problem is to prove that u is harmonic, i.e., Δu = 0 in U.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the user says: \"prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic.\" So the problem is to show the equivalence between weakly harmonic (as defined by the integral) and harmonic (Δu=0), under the assumption that u is continuous. The other parts are about their thought process and proof attempt, but the core problem is that equivalence.\n\nSo, the formatted problem should have assumptions:\n\n- u is continuous in U.\n- For every test function ϕ ∈ C0^∞(U), ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0.\n- U is an open subset of ℝ^n.\n\nProblem: Prove that u is harmonic, i.e., Δu = 0 in U.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7, then the problem. Here, the user is allowed to assume u is continuous, even though the result holds more generally. So the key assumptions to list would be the continuity of u and the integral condition, along with the domain being open.\n\nAlso, the user's confusion about why the test function method doesn't imply u=0 is part of their reasoning but not part of the problem's assumptions. The actual problem to structure is the one they were working on in the exercise: proving the equivalence under the assumption of continuity.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nFor every function ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U), ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem: Prove that Δu = 0 in U.\n\nBut the problem is to show equivalence. Wait, the problem says \"prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic\". So actually, it's two directions:\n\n1. If u is harmonic (Δu=0), then it is weakly harmonic (the integral condition holds).\n2. If u is weakly harmonic and continuous, then it is harmonic.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 given n is integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove equivalence. However, the user's main task is to show the reverse direction (weakly harmonic implies harmonic), since the forward direction is straightforward via integration by parts.\n\nBut the original problem as stated in the user's question is: \"the exercise [...] asks us to define a weakly harmonic function as one which satisfies ∫uΔϕ=0, and asks us to prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic: Δu=0.\"\n\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that the two conditions are equivalent. So the assumptions would include both directions. But in the example, assumptions were the conditions given, and the problem was the conclusion. Here, for equivalence, we need to structure it as:\n\nAssumptions for each direction? Wait, the user's problem is to prove equivalence. So perhaps the problem is stated as \"Prove that a continuous function u is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic.\" Then the assumptions would include the continuity of u and U being open.\n\nBut according to the example format, the assumptions are the given conditions. Since the problem is to show equivalence, the user's formatted problem should have assumptions necessary for both directions. However, in the example, the assumption was n is integer and divisible by 7, then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. Here, the problem is an equivalence, so maybe the assumptions are the conditions required for the equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that under the assumption of continuity, weakly harmonic implies harmonic, and vice versa. The forward direction (harmonic implies weakly harmonic) is straightforward via integration by parts, but the reverse is the non-trivial part requiring continuity.\n\nBut the user's main issue was about the reverse direction. However, the problem as stated in the exercise is to prove the equivalence. So perhaps the formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that u is weakly harmonic (i.e., ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0 for all ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U)) if and only if u is harmonic (Δu = 0 in U).\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So the assumptions are the hypotheses given for the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the problem is to prove equivalence, which has two directions. The forward direction (harmonic implies weakly harmonic) requires u to be smooth enough to integrate by parts, which is given if u is C². However, the user mentions that in the exercise, they are allowed to assume u is continuous, and the result is true for more general u. But in the proof provided, they assume u is continuous and use mollifiers.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- u is continuous in U.\n- U is open.\n\nThe problem is to prove that u is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic.\n\nBut since the problem is an equivalence, perhaps it's better to structure it as two separate problems, but the user's original problem is stated as an equivalence. Alternatively, in the example, the problem was one direction (prove A(n) is divisible by 91 given assumptions on n). Here, the problem is to show equivalence under the assumptions of continuity and U being open.\n\nThus, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ,\nFor every ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U), ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Δu = 0 in U.\n\nBut wait, the equivalence is two parts. However, in the user's case, the exercise is to prove that the weakly harmonic condition is equivalent to being harmonic, assuming continuity. So perhaps the problem is:\n\nProblem: Prove that a continuous function u in an open set U is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was a single direction. To fit the format, maybe split into two problems. However, the user presents it as one problem asking for equivalence.\n\nAlternatively, the problem as stated in the exercise is to prove the equivalence, so the formatted problem should reflect that. However, the example given by the user structures a problem where the assumptions are given and the problem is to prove a conclusion. Here, since it's an equivalence, perhaps the assumptions include the continuity and the open domain, and the problem is to prove the equivalence between weak and classical solutions.\n\nBut maybe the user's main focus is on the reverse direction (weakly harmonic + continuous implies harmonic), since the forward is straightforward. However, the problem as posed in the exercise is to show equivalence.\n\nGiven that, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that u is weakly harmonic (i.e., ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0 for all ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U)) if and only if u is harmonic (Δu = 0 in U).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's hypotheses. Here, the hypotheses for the equivalence are u's continuity and U being open. The problem is the equivalence. However, the user's own proof mainly addresses the reverse direction (weakly harmonic implies harmonic), since the forward is done via integration by parts.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be structured as two separate problems, but the exercise is to show equivalence. Given the format requires a single problem statement, perhaps it's best to present the problem as proving the equivalence under the given assumptions.\n\nBut the example given by the user has a single direction. To adhere to the example's style, perhaps here we need to split it. However, the user's original question is about the exercise asking to prove equivalence.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's better to structure the problem as the reverse direction (weakly harmonic + continuous implies harmonic), since the forward is straightforward. The user's main struggle was with the reverse.\n\nBut according to the problem statement in the user's post: \"it asks us to define a weakly harmonic function [...] and asks us to prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic [...] allowed to assume u is continuous [...]\".\n\nThus, the full problem is to prove equivalence. However, in the example, the problem was to prove divisibility given assumptions. Here, the problem is an equivalence, but the format might require stating the problem as proving the implication from the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is allowed to assume continuity, and needs to prove equivalence, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that u is weakly harmonic if and only if u is harmonic.\n\nBut the original problem in the exercise says \"prove that this condition is equivalent to being harmonic\". So the assumptions are the ones given in the problem, which include u being continuous. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nFor every ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U), ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Δu = 0 in U.\n\nBut this captures only one direction. To capture the equivalence, maybe the problem should be phrased as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the following are equivalent:\n1. u is harmonic in U (Δu = 0),\n2. u is weakly harmonic in U (∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0 for all ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U)).\n\nBut under the assumption that u is continuous in U and U is open.\n\nHowever, the example provided by the user has a single problem statement, not an equivalence. Given that, perhaps the user's format expects to state the problem as one direction, with the necessary assumptions.\n\nBut the original exercise is to prove equivalence. Given the example's format, perhaps we need to adjust. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, given n is integer and divisible by 7. The formatted version listed those two assumptions and the problem as the conclusion.\n\nSimilarly, here, the problem is to prove that u is harmonic (Δu=0) given that it's weakly harmonic and continuous in an open set U. The forward direction (harmonic implies weakly harmonic) would have different assumptions, but the exercise is about the equivalence.\n\nHowever, since the user's main proof is about weakly harmonic + continuous => harmonic, and the forward is straightforward, perhaps the problem is to prove that a continuous weakly harmonic function is harmonic, with assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nu is continuous in U,\nFor every ϕ ∈ C₀^∞(U), ∫_U u Δϕ dx = 0,\nU is an open subset of ℝⁿ.\n\nProblem:\nProve that Δu = 0 in U.\n\nThat would align with the example structure. The equivalence is achieved by two separate problems, but the user's main focus is on the non-trivial direction. Given the exercise asks to prove equivalence, but the format requires a single problem, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would have assumptions of continuity, weakly harmonic, and U open, with the problem to prove Δu=0.",
