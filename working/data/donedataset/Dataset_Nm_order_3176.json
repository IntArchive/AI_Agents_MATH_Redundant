    "Content": "Today I was watching a series of online video lectures about electromagnetism. At some point of the lecture, the professor used this vector calculus identity: $$ \\nabla\\times\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)=\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\right)-\\mathbf{B}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\right)+\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}-\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{B}$$ So, I tried to prove it by using the \"bac-cab\" identity and I kept getting wrong results. Later, I realized that the \"bac-cab\" identity for vector triple products doesn't hold anymore when vector operators like $\\nabla$ are involved! Is it normal that I don't know any vector analysis? I've taken multi-variable calculus, but they didn't teach us anything about such identities! Did my university cheat on us and taught us less than we should know or it's normal for pure math students not to know vector analysis identities as well as engineers and physicists know them? And at last, I'll appreciate it if someone introduces a good introductory book about vector calculus that teaches me how to deal with such vector equations and identities.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The comments made thus far give excellent advice. I thought you might like to see the details. We need the well-known identity $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\epsilon_{ikj}\\epsilon_{lmj} = \\delta_{il}\\delta_{km}-\\delta_{kl}\\delta_{im}$.

I had pages and pages of stuff and he had three lines on a particular problem. It hit me, I probably should use $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ for vector identity calculations. Moreover, there is a whole family of contracting levi-civita symbols as sums of antisymmetric kronecker deltas. The identity this post begins with is just a start. These are used in the tensor calculus of General Relativity.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, and the problem is restated clearly.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The title is about whether it's normal for a pure math student not to know vector analysis. The main question includes a vector calculus identity involving the curl of a cross product, the user's attempt using the bac-cab identity, realizing it doesn't work with operators like nabla, and questions about university curriculum and book recommendations.\n\nThe task is to filter out unrelated information and structure the problem. The example shows that assumptions are specific conditions. Here, the problem is about proving the identity. The key assumptions would relate to the properties of the vector fields A and B, and the operations involved. However, the original problem doesn't state explicit assumptions, so I need to infer them based on standard vector calculus identities.\n\nTypically, such identities assume that A and B are differentiable vector fields. The operations like curl, divergence, and cross products require the fields to be sufficiently smooth (usually twice differentiable). So each assumption should be a single property for one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a differentiable vector field,\n- B is a differentiable vector field,\n- All components of A and B have continuous second-order partial derivatives.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state these; the user mentions using the bac-cab identity which doesn't apply here. Since the problem is to prove the identity, the assumptions are generally about the differentiability of the vector fields involved.\n\nSo, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a twice differentiable vector field,\nB is a twice differentiable vector field,\nThe partial derivatives of A and B are continuous.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\nabla\\times\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)=\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\right)-\\mathbf{B}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\right)+\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}-\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{B} $$\n\nWait, but the example given in the original instruction includes specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are more about the properties of A and B. So each line should be a single condition. For example:\n\n- A is a vector field,\n- B is a vector field,\n- A is twice differentiable,\n- B is twice differentiable,\n- The partial derivatives of A are continuous,\n- The partial derivatives of B are continuous.\n\nBut maybe that's too granular. Alternatively, combining differentiability and continuity into one line per object. However, the example shows each assumption is a single line addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a differentiable vector field,\nB is a differentiable vector field,\nThe second partial derivatives of A are continuous,\nThe second partial derivatives of B are continuous.\n\nBut usually, in vector calculus, when dealing with such identities, we assume the vector fields are smooth enough (i.e., their components have continuous second partial derivatives) to ensure the equality holds. So each assumption should be a single property. Alternatively, maybe:\n\n- A and B are twice continuously differentiable vector fields.\n\nBut the example splits into separate lines. Hmm. The example given by the user for the divisibility problem lists each condition on n separately. So for this problem, each assumption should be a single condition on a single object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a vector field,\nB is a vector field,\nA is twice differentiable,\nB is twice differentiable,\nThe partial derivatives of A are continuous,\nThe partial derivatives of B are continuous.\n\nBut this might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a twice continuously differentiable vector field,\nB is a twice continuously differentiable vector field.\n\nBut \"twice continuously differentiable\" combines two properties: being twice differentiable and the derivatives being continuous. However, the example splits \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" into separate lines, even though the second is a consequence of the first and additional condition. But here, the problem doesn't state any such conditions explicitly, so the assumptions are about the necessary conditions for the identity to hold, which are the differentiability and continuity of the vector fields.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's problem is just to prove the identity, and the key assumption is that A and B are vector fields with sufficient differentiability. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a differentiable vector field,\nB is a differentiable vector field,\nThe necessary partial derivatives of A and B exist and are continuous.\n\nBut to match the example's style, each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a vector field,\nB is a vector field,\nAll first partial derivatives of A exist,\nAll first partial derivatives of B exist,\nAll second partial derivatives of A exist and are continuous,\nAll second partial derivatives of B exist and are continuous.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, in standard vector calculus proofs, we often assume that the vector fields are sufficiently smooth, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are smooth vector fields.\n\nBut \"smooth\" usually means infinitely differentiable, which is stronger than needed. The identity likely requires C^2 functions (twice continuously differentiable). However, since the original problem doesn't specify, maybe it's safer to list the necessary conditions as per standard proofs.\n\nLooking up the identity: the curl of a cross product identity. The standard proof uses the product rule for curl, which involves first derivatives. So perhaps the minimal assumptions are that A and B are differentiable once, and their partial derivatives are continuous (i.e., C^1). Wait, but the identity involves divergence of A and B, which is a first derivative, and terms like (B·∇)A, which are first derivatives. So maybe C^1 is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a continuously differentiable vector field,\nB is a continuously differentiable vector field.\n\nBut each on a separate line:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a continuously differentiable vector field,\nB is a continuously differentiable vector field.\n\nThat should suffice. Because to compute the curl of (A × B), you need A and B to be differentiable, and for the product rule to hold, their derivatives need to be continuous (to ensure the equality holds).\n\nSo, in the example, the user split into two lines for n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the two vector fields each being continuously differentiable would be two separate assumptions.\n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a continuously differentiable vector field,\nB is a continuously differentiable vector field.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$ \\nabla\\times\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{B}\\right)=\\mathbf{A}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B}\\right)-\\mathbf{B}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\right)+\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{A}-\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{B} $$\n\nThis captures the necessary conditions without overcomplicating. The original question mentions the user tried using bac-cab and failed, but that's part of their attempt, not part of the problem's assumptions. The problem is to prove the identity given the vector fields are sufficiently smooth, which in this case is being continuously differentiable.",
