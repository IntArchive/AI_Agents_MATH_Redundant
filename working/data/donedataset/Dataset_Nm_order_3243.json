    "Content": "Let $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots , a_n, b_n$ be nonnegative real numbers. Prove that $$\\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \\min\\{a_ia_j, b_ib_j\\} \\le \\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \\min\\{a_ib_j, a_jb_i\\}.$$ How do I prove this inequality. I have studied only basic inequalities, namely AM-GM, CS inequality and Tchebycheff's inequality. How do I incorporate that condition of minimum of the two chosen numbers and prove the inequality using the above ones\n?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "It's USA 2000. The following solution is not mine. Since if $\\min\\{a_i,b_i\\}=0$ then $\\min\\{a_ia_j,b_ib_j\\}=\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}=0,$ we can assume that $a_i>0$ and $b_i>0$. Lemma 1. Let $r_i\\geq0$ and $x_i$ be real numbers. Prove that:\n$$\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}x_ix_j\\geq0.$$\nProof. Since $\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}=\\min\\{r_j,r_i\\},$ we can assume that $0=r_0\\leq r_1\\leq r_2\\leq...\\leq r_n$ and we obtain:\n$$\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}x_ix_j=\\sum_{i=1}^nr_ix_i^2+2\\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n}r_ix_ix_j=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(r_i-r_{i-1}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j=i}^nx_j\\right)^2\\geq0.$$\nLemma 2. Let $a_i>0$, $b_i>0$, $r_i=\\frac{\\max\\{a_i,b_i\\}}{\\min\\{a_i,b_i\\}}-1$ and $x_i=sign(a_i-b_i)\\min\\{a_i,b_i\\}.$ Prove that:\n$$\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}-\\min\\{a_ia_j,b_ib_j\\}=\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}x_ix_j.$$\nProof. Since replacing $a_i$ with $b_i$ gives replacing signs of the both sides, we can assume that $a_i\\geq b_i$. Similarly, we can assume that $a_j\\geq b_j$ and we obtain:\n$$\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}x_ix_j=\\min\\left\\{\\frac{a_i}{b_i}-1,\\frac{a_j}{b_j}-1\\right\\}b_ib_j=$$\n$$=\\min\\{a_ib_j-b_ib_j,a_jb_i-b_ib_j\\}=\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}-b_ib_j=$$\n$$=\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}-\\min\\{a_ia_j,b_ib_j\\}.$$\nNow, by applying of these lemmas we obtain:\n$$\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}-\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\min\\{a_ia_j,b_ib_j\\}=$$\n$$=\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\left(\\min\\{a_ib_j,a_jb_i\\}-\\min\\{a_ia_j,b_ib_j\\}\\right)=\\sum_{i,j=1}^n\\min\\{r_i,r_j\\}x_ix_j\\geq0$$ and we are done! For $n=4$ we obtain:\n$$(r_4-r_3)x_4^2+(r_3-r_2)(x_3+x_4)^2+(r_2-r_1)(x_2+x_3+x_4)^2+(r_1-r_0)(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4)^2=$$\n$$=r_1x_1^2+(r_2-r_1+r_1)x_2^2+(r_3-r_2+r_2-r_1+r_1)x_3^2+(r_4-r_3+r_3-r_2+r_2-r_1+r_1)x_4^2+$$\n$$+2r_1x_1x_2+2r_1x_1x_3+2r_1x_1x_4+2(r_2-r_1+r_1)x_2x_3+$$\n$$+2(r_2-r_1+r_1)x_2x_4+2(r_3-r_2+r_2-r_1+r_1)x_3x_4=$$\n$$=r_1x_1^2+r_2x_2^2+x_3r_3^2+r_4x_4^2+2r_1x_1x_2+2r_1x_1x_3+2r_1x_1x_4+$$\n$$+2r_2x_2x_3+2r_2x_2x_4+2r_3x_3x_4.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem as per the required format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions from the original question. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem: We have nonnegative real numbers a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, ..., a_n, b_n. The inequality to prove involves the sum of minima of products. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are that each a_i and b_i are nonnegative real numbers. Each of these applies to individual pairs (a_i, b_i) for i from 1 to n. Since the problem states that all a_i and b_i are nonnegative, I need to list each as a separate assumption. Wait, but in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the conditions are that all a_i and b_i are nonnegative. However, the example had two separate assumptions about n. Similarly, here, perhaps each pair (a_i, b_i) has nonnegative components. But since the variables are all listed as nonnegative, maybe each a_i and each b_i is a nonnegative real number. So, each a_i is nonnegative, each b_i is nonnegative. But the problem states \"nonnegative real numbers\" for all a1, b1, ..., an, bn. So perhaps each a_i and b_i is a nonnegative real number. So the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach a_i is a nonnegative real number,\nEach b_i is a nonnegative real number,\ni ranges from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line. Let me check the example again. The original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate condition. Here, the problem states that a1, b1, ..., an, bn are nonnegative real numbers. So each a_i and b_i is nonnegative. But the user might need to break this into separate lines. However, since the original problem states \"nonnegative real numbers\" collectively, maybe the assumption is that all a_i and b_i are nonnegative. But according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps each variable (a1, a2, ..., an, b1, ..., bn) is a nonnegative real number. But that would result in 2n assumptions, which is impractical. Alternatively, perhaps group them as each a_i is nonnegative and each b_i is nonnegative. So two assumptions: one for all a_i and one for all b_i.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i, a_i is a nonnegative real number,\nFor each i, b_i is a nonnegative real number.\n\nThese are two separate assumptions, each applying to a different set of variables. Then, the problem is the inequality as stated.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nFor each i from 1 to n, a_i is a nonnegative real number,\nFor each i from 1 to n, b_i is a nonnegative real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$\\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \\min\\{a_i a_j, b_i b_j\\} \\le \\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \\min\\{a_i b_j, a_j b_i\\}.$$\n\nI need to ensure that the problem statement is exactly as given. The original problem mentions \"How to prove this inequality involving the minimum of two chosen numbers\" and the problem is the inequality as written. The user also mentions that they have studied basic inequalities like AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz, and Tchebycheff's, but the answer format doesn't require addressing that part, only structuring the problem.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the two assumptions listed, each addressing the nonnegativity of a_i and b_i respectively, and then the problem statement.",
