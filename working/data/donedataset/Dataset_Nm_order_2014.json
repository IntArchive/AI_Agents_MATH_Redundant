    "Content": "Prove that the derivative of an even differentiable function is odd, and the derivative of an odd differentiable function is even. Here are my workings so far. Lets prove the derivative of an odd differentiable function is even first. Let the odd function be $f(x)$ . We have $f(-x)=-f(x)$ and $\\lim_{x\\to a^-} f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to a^+}f(x)=\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)$ $$f'(-x)= \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {f(-x+h)-f(-x)}{h}= \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {-f(x-h)+f(x)}{h}$$ And so, I am stuck. Thanks in advance. Hints are appreciated. Solutions are even more welcome!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Continuing from your last line, \n$$\n\\lim_{h\\to 0} -\\frac {f(x-h)-f(x)}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {f(x-h)-f(x)}{-h}=f'(x) \n$$ That completes the proof for $f$ an odd function. The analogous approach will probably work for $f(x)$ an even function. $$\n\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {f(-x+h)-f(-x)}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {f(x-h)-f(x)}{h}=-\\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac {f(x-h)-f(x)}{-h}=-f'(x) \n$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the user wants to prove that the derivative of an even differentiable function is odd and that the derivative of an odd differentiable function is even. Let me start by recalling the definitions of even and odd functions. \n\nAn even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. The problem involves derivatives, so we need to connect the parity of the function (even or odd) to the parity of its derivative.\n\nThe user started with trying to prove the derivative of an odd function is even. Let's look at their attempt. They wrote f'(-x) as the limit definition: the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(-x + h) - f(-x)] / h. Then they substituted the property of the odd function, replacing f(-x + h) with -f(x - h) and f(-x) with -f(x). So they got the expression [ -f(x - h) + f(x) ] / h. \n\nHmm, maybe they can manipulate this expression further. Let's see. If we factor out a negative sign from the numerator, we get [ - (f(x - h) - f(x)) ] / h. That's equivalent to - [f(x - h) - f(x)] / h. Now, notice that the term [f(x - h) - f(x)] / h is similar to the definition of the derivative, but with a negative h. If we let k = -h, then as h approaches 0, k approaches 0 as well. So substituting, we get - [f(x + k) - f(x)] / (-k) = - [ - (f(x + k) - f(x)) / k ] = (f(x + k) - f(x)) / k. Taking the limit as k approaches 0, this is just the derivative f'(x). Therefore, f'(-x) = f'(x), which means the derivative is even. That seems right for the odd function case.\n\nNow, for the even function case. Let's take an even function f, so f(-x) = f(x). To find the derivative at -x, f'(-x) would again use the limit definition: limit as h approaches 0 of [f(-x + h) - f(-x)] / h. Substitute f(-x + h) with f(x - h) because f is even, and f(-x) is f(x). So the expression becomes [f(x - h) - f(x)] / h. Similar to before, let's substitute k = -h. Then when h approaches 0, k approaches 0. So the expression becomes [f(x + k) - f(x)] / (-k) = - [f(x + k) - f(x)] / k. Taking the limit as k approaches 0, this is -f'(x). Therefore, f'(-x) = -f'(x), which means the derivative is odd.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the key steps are applying the definition of the derivative, using the even or odd property to substitute f(-x + h), then changing variables in the limit to relate it back to the original derivative. The user might have gotten stuck because they didn't make the substitution of variables (like h to k) to recognize the derivative expression. So the trick is to manipulate the limit to express it in terms of the derivative at x.\n\nLet me verify if there are any missing assumptions. The problem states that the functions are differentiable, which is important because we need the derivative to exist. Also, the functions need to be defined on symmetric domains around the origin for the even and odd properties to hold for all x. But the original problem didn't mention the domain, so perhaps we can assume that the functions are defined on all real numbers or an interval symmetric about the origin. But since the user didn't specify, maybe it's okay as is. The key assumptions are that the function is differentiable (so the derivative exists) and that it's either even or odd. So each part of the problem has different assumptions: one part assumes the function is even and differentiable, the other assumes it's odd and differentiable.",
