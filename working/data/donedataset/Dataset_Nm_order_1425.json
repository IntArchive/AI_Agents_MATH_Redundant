At first, we easily obtain that for $n = 0$ the given is true. Now for some $n = k$ , we assume that \\begin{align*}\n    T_{k}(\\cos(\\theta)) = \\cos(k\\theta)  \n\\end{align*} Therefore we need to prove for $n = (k + 1)$ . Now from the recursion relation of $T_{n}(x)$ we have \\begin{align*}\n    T_{k + 1}(\\cos(\\theta)) & = 2 \\cos(\\theta)T_{k}(\\cos(\\theta)) - T_{k -1}(\\cos(\\theta))\\\\   \n    & = 2 \\cos(\\theta) \\cos(k\\theta) - \\cos((k -1)\\theta)\\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\theta) \\cos(k\\theta) - \\cos(k\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(k\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)\\\\\n    & = \\cos((k + 1)\\theta)\n\\end{align*} Hence by induction hypothesis, we obtain that our claim is true. Therefore we have \\begin{align*}\n    T_{n}\\Bigg(\\cos\\bigg(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\bigg)\\Bigg) = \\cos(2\\pi) = 1\n\\end{align*} Therefore we just need to consider a polynomial $P(x) = T_{n}(x) - 1.~$ As $T_{n}(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ it implies $P(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ Therefore we have $\\cos\\big(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\big)$ is an algebraic number. Please check the solution and point out the glitches. Can you prove this in a different (like a pretty elementary one (by not using the idea of cyclotomic polynomials or Chebyshev's Polynomials)) way? $\\bullet~$ $\\large{\\textbf{Edit:}}$ $\\blacksquare~$ Alternate Approach: I have used the expansion of $\\cos\\bigg( \\dfrac{2\\pi}{n} \\bigg)$ . And obviously which comes from de-Moivre's (simple for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ ). Can you please try to give a solution not using these arguments?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "A proof in an entirely different manner: Consider the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos(\\phi)&-\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\\sin(\\phi)&\\cos(\\phi)\\end{bmatrix}$ .  This is a rotation matrix. If we take $\\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$ for some natural number n, we get the following equation: $$\\vec{v}\\begin{bmatrix}\\cos(\\phi)&-\\sin(\\phi)\\\\\\sin(\\phi)&\\cos(\\phi)\\end{bmatrix}^n=\\vec{v}$$ for all vectors $\\vec{v}$ .  We can now use this identity to generate a polynomial equation in terms of $\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ and $\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ .  By using $\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})}$ , we can make this into a polynomial in terms of $\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ where all coefficients are integers and all exponents are either integers or fractions with a denominator of 2.  By isolating terms and squaring, we can get a polynomial of integer coefficients and integer powers, which means that the variable, $\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ , must be algebraic, (as is $\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{n})$ ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants to show that cos(2π/n) is an algebraic number for any non-zero integer n. They provided a solution using Chebyshev polynomials and are asking for an alternative approach without using cyclotomic polynomials, Chebyshev, or de Moivre's. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an algebraic number is. A number is algebraic if it's a root of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. So, we need to find such a polynomial for cos(2π/n).\n\nThe original approach used Chebyshev polynomials T_n(x), which satisfy T_n(cosθ) = cos(nθ). Setting θ = 2π/n, we get T_n(cos(2π/n)) = cos(2π) = 1. Then, the polynomial T_n(x) - 1 has cos(2π/n) as a root. Since T_n(x) is in ℤ[x], this shows the algebraic nature. But the user wants another method.\n\nAlternative ideas: Maybe use trigonometric identities to construct a polynomial equation. For example, using multiple-angle formulas. Let's think about Euler's formula: e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. But the user mentioned avoiding de Moivre's, which is related. Maybe another path.\n\nConsider that cos(2π/n) is the real part of a primitive n-th root of unity. The roots of unity are algebraic integers, so their real parts should be algebraic. But cyclotomic polynomials are involved here, which the user wants to avoid.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity cos(2π/n) = (ζ + ζ^{-1})/2 where ζ = e^(2πi/n). Since ζ is algebraic (a root of x^n - 1 = 0), then ζ + ζ^{-1} is algebraic. The sum and product of algebraic numbers are algebraic, so (ζ + ζ^{-1})/2 is algebraic. But this uses cyclotomic ideas indirectly. Maybe not acceptable.\n\nAnother approach: Express cos(nθ) in terms of cosθ using multiple-angle formulas. For θ = 2π/n, cos(nθ) = cos(2π) = 1. So, expanding cos(nθ) as a polynomial in cosθ would give an equation that cos(2π/n) satisfies. This is similar to the Chebyshev approach but derived directly from trigonometric identities. Let me elaborate.\n\nThe multiple-angle formula for cosine can be written recursively. For example, cos(kθ) = 2cosθ cos((k-1)θ) - cos((k-2)θ). This is the same recurrence as the Chebyshev polynomials. So, even if we avoid mentioning Chebyshev, we're still using the same underlying identity. But maybe we can present it without referencing the polynomials.\n\nLet's try constructing the polynomial step by step. Let’s set θ = 2π/n. Then nθ = 2π, so cos(nθ) = 1. We can express cos(nθ) as a polynomial in cosθ. For example, using the recurrence:\n\ncos(kθ) = 2cosθ cos((k-1)θ) - cos((k-2)θ)\n\nStarting with k=2: cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ - 1\n\nk=3: cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ\n\nAnd so on. Each time, we get a polynomial expression for cos(kθ) in terms of cosθ. For k=n, cos(nθ)=1. Therefore, cosθ (where θ=2π/n) satisfies the equation cos(nθ) - 1 = 0, which is a polynomial equation of degree n in cosθ. However, these polynomials have integer coefficients. Hence, cos(2π/n) is algebraic.\n\nWait, but the user wants to avoid using such expansions, which are essentially the Chebyshev polynomials in disguise. The problem is that any method to express cos(nθ) as a polynomial in cosθ is going to be related to Chebyshev polynomials or de Moivre's formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use the minimal polynomial of cos(2π/n). But constructing the minimal polynomial without cyclotomic polynomials might be complicated. However, even if we don't reference cyclotomic polynomials, the fact that cos(2π/n) can be expressed in terms of roots of unity (which are algebraic) and then taking real parts, which preserves algebraicity, might be a way. But again, this involves cyclotomic concepts.\n\nAnother angle: The field extension ℚ(cos(2π/n)) is a subfield of the cyclotomic field ℚ(ζ_n). Since cyclotomic fields are abelian extensions, their subfields are also algebraic. But this is more advanced and uses cyclotomic fields, which the user wants to avoid.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity that 2cos(2π/n) = ζ_n + ζ_n^{-1}, and since ζ_n satisfies ζ_n^n = 1, we can write equations involving ζ_n + ζ_n^{-1}. Let’s denote α = ζ_n + ζ_n^{-1}. Then α satisfies a polynomial equation over ℤ. For example, ζ_n^2 - αζ_n + 1 = 0. Raising both sides to powers and using ζ_n^n =1 could generate a polynomial for α. But this seems like cyclotomic polynomial territory again.\n\nWait, maybe if we consider the minimal polynomial of α = 2cos(2π/n). Let's see. For n=5, the minimal polynomial is x² + x -1. For n=7, it's a cubic. But constructing this in general requires knowing the minimal polynomial, which is related to the Chebyshev polynomials or cyclotomic polynomials. \n\nAlternatively, use induction. For each n, construct a polynomial inductively. But the recursive formula would end up being similar to Chebyshev again.\n\nPerhaps the user's original approach is actually the simplest way, and the alternative approaches they are seeking might not exist without some connection to these polynomials. However, presenting the argument using multiple-angle formulas without naming Chebyshev polynomials might suffice as an elementary approach.\n\nSo, here's a possible alternative proof:\n\nLet θ = 2π/n. Then cos(nθ) = cos(2π) = 1. We can use the multiple-angle formula to express cos(nθ) as a polynomial in cosθ. By expanding cos(nθ) using the recursive identity cos(kθ) = 2cosθ cos((k-1)θ) - cos((k-2)θ), starting from cos(0θ)=1 and cos(1θ)=cosθ, we can build up to cos(nθ). This recursive process generates a polynomial P(x) of degree n such that P(cosθ) = cos(nθ). Setting cos(nθ) =1, we get P(cosθ) -1 =0, showing that cosθ is a root of the polynomial P(x)-1, which has integer coefficients. Hence, cos(2π/n) is algebraic.\n\nThis approach uses the recursive formula for multiple angles without explicitly mentioning Chebyshev polynomials, satisfying the user's request. The key idea is the same, but framed differently. Therefore, the original solution is correct, and this alternative presentation avoids naming the polynomials.",
