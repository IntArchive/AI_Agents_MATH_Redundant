    "AcceptedAnswer": "$Q_8$ has three cyclic subgroups of order $4$ : $\\langle i\\rangle$ , $\\langle j\\rangle$ , $\\langle k\\rangle$ , and ${\\rm Aut}(Q_8)$ acts on these three subgroups; inducing a homomorphism $\\Phi\\colon{\\rm Aut}(Q_8)\\rightarrow S_3$ . We can see that, the homomorphism is surjective, since the two automorphisms $f\\colon i\\mapsto j, j\\mapsto i$ , and $g\\colon j\\mapsto k, k\\mapsto j$ give two transpositions in $S_3$ . The kernel contains those $\\varphi\\in{\\rm Aut}(G)$ such that $\\varphi(\\langle i\\rangle)=\\langle i\\rangle$ and $\\varphi(\\langle j\\rangle)=\\langle j\\rangle$ ( automatically, $\\varphi(\\langle k\\rangle)=\\langle k\\rangle$ ). (1) $\\varphi(\\langle i\\rangle)=\\langle i\\rangle$ means $\\varphi(i)\\in \\{i,-i\\}$ , and similarly, $\\varphi(j)\\in \\{j,-j\\}$ . One can check that these four choices are automorphisms of order $2$ (or $1$ ) (since they are switching elements in a pair ), and hence kernel is Klein- $4$ group $V_4$ . (2) Since, automorphisms in the kernel fix all the cyclic subgroups of $Q_8$ (not necessarily point-wise); consider the following automorphisms: $S: i\\mapsto j, j\\mapsto i$ , (hence $k\\mapsto -k$ ) and $T\\colon j\\mapsto k, k\\mapsto j$ (hence $i\\mapsto -i$ ); these are not inner (since they fix a subgroup), and they generate $S_3$ (they are like transpositions $(1\\,2)$ and $(2\\,3)$ ). Therefore, we have $\\langle S,T \\rangle=K\\leq{\\rm Aut}(Q_8)$ , such that $K\\cong S_3$ and $\\Phi(K)=S_3$ . Also, $\\ker(\\Phi) \\cap K=\\phi $ . Therefore, ${\\rm Aut}(Q_8)=\\ker(\\Phi)\\rtimes K \\cong V_4\\rtimes S_3$ . Consider an element of $\\ker(\\Phi)$ : $f:i\\mapsto -i$ , $j\\mapsto j$ , and two elements of $K\\cong Im$ : $g\\colon i\\mapsto j,  j\\mapsto i $ (like a transposition), and $h\\colon i\\mapsto j, j\\mapsto k$ (like a $3$ -cycle). One can check that $f$ doesn't commute with $g$ as well as $h$ . In fact, this shows that no element of $V_4\\setminus\\{1\\}$ commutes with any element of $K\\setminus \\{ 1\\}$ (by inter-changing roles of $i,j,k$ ); this means, the action of $K$ on $V_4$ (by conjugation) is faithful ; and up to equivalence, there is only one such action. Therefore, ${\\rm Aut}(Q_8)=V_4\\rtimes K\\cong S_4$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about determining the automorphism group of the quaternion group Q8 and showing that it's isomorphic to S4, the symmetric group on four elements. The user mentioned they found geometric proofs relating it to the rotation group of a cube but want an algebraic approach. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the quaternion group Q8 is. Q8 has eight elements: {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}. The multiplication follows the rules i² = j² = k² = -1, ij = k, jk = i, ki = j, and so on, with the usual quaternion relations. Also, multiplying by -1 commutes with any element. \n\nAn automorphism of Q8 is a bijective homomorphism from Q8 to itself. So, Aut(Q8) consists of all such maps that preserve the group structure. The goal is to show that this automorphism group is isomorphic to S4.\n\nLet me start by considering the elements of Q8. The elements 1 and -1 are central since they commute with everyone. The other elements are i, -i, j, -j, k, -k. Each of these has order 4 because, for example, i² = -1, and (-1)² = 1. So, any automorphism must map elements of order 4 to elements of order 4. Also, since automorphisms preserve the group structure, they must preserve the relations between the elements.\n\nIn Q8, the elements i, j, k are generators. So, perhaps an automorphism is determined by where it sends these generators. But we have to make sure that the images of i, j, k satisfy the same relations. For example, if φ is an automorphism, then φ(i)² = φ(i²) = φ(-1) = -1, since automorphisms preserve inverses and powers. Similarly, φ(i)φ(j) = φ(ij) = φ(k). So, the images of i, j must multiply to the image of k, which must then be φ(k).\n\nBut since Q8 is generated by i and j (since k can be obtained as ij), maybe an automorphism is determined by where it sends i and j. However, we have to ensure that φ(i) and φ(j) satisfy the same relations as i and j. That is, φ(i)² = -1, φ(j)² = -1, and φ(i)φ(j) = φ(j)φ(i)⁻¹ (since ij = k and ji = -k). Wait, actually, the relation between i and j is that ij = k, and ji = -k. So, in terms of relations, we have ij = -ji. So, φ(i)φ(j) = -φ(j)φ(i). Also, φ(i)² = φ(-1), and similarly for φ(j)². But φ(-1) must be -1 because automorphisms preserve order, and -1 has order 2. So, φ(-1) = -1.\n\nTherefore, any automorphism must fix -1 and 1, since they are in the center. So, automorphisms can permute the elements of order 4, but must preserve the relations. The elements of order 4 are i, -i, j, -j, k, -k. However, automorphisms can't send an element to any arbitrary element of order 4; they have to preserve the multiplication structure.\n\nFor example, if φ sends i to j, then φ must send j to some element such that φ(i)φ(j) = φ(k). Let's see: if φ(i)=j and φ(j)=k, then φ(i)φ(j)=jk = i, but φ(k) should be i, which is okay. But then we need to check all relations. This might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the automorphism group by looking at the possible images of the generators. Since Q8 can be generated by two elements, say i and j, each automorphism is determined by the images of i and j. Let's see: if we pick φ(i) and φ(j), they must satisfy the same relations as i and j. That is, φ(i)² = -1, φ(j)² = -1, and φ(i)φ(j) = φ(j)φ(i)⁻¹ = -φ(j)φ(i).\n\nSo, φ(i) and φ(j) must be elements of order 4, their squares must be -1, and their product must anti-commute. Now, in Q8, the elements of order 4 are {i, -i, j, -j, k, -k}. So, possible candidates for φ(i) and φ(j) are among these, but they must satisfy that φ(i) and φ(j) anti-commute. \n\nLet's think: if φ(i) is i, then φ(j) can be j, -j, k, or -k, but need to check the anti-commute condition. Wait, if φ(i) = i and φ(j) = j, then ij = k and ji = -k, so they anti-commute. Similarly, if φ(j) = k, then i and k must anti-commute. But in Q8, ik = -ki, so yes. Wait, but if φ(j) = k, then φ(i)φ(j) = ik = -ki = -φ(j)φ(i), which satisfies the anti-commute condition. Similarly, if φ(j) is -j, then φ(i)φ(j) = i(-j) = -ij = -k, and φ(j)φ(i) = (-j)i = -ji = k, so φ(i)φ(j) = -φ(j)φ(i). So, that's okay.\n\nSo, perhaps the automorphisms can permute the pairs {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k}, but also need to preserve the multiplication relations. But maybe it's more than that. For example, can an automorphism send i to j and j to k? Let's check. Suppose φ(i) = j and φ(j) = k. Then φ(k) = φ(ij) = φ(i)φ(j) = jk = i. Then φ(i) = j, φ(j) = k, φ(k) = i. Then, need to check other relations. For instance, φ(j)φ(k) should be φ(jk) = φ(i), but jk = i. φ(j)φ(k) = k i = -ik = -j. But φ(jk) = φ(i) = j. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, there's a problem here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see:\n\nIf φ(i)=j, φ(j)=k, then φ(k)=φ(ij)=φ(i)φ(j)=j k = i. Then, φ(j)φ(k) = k i = -i k = -j. But φ(jk) = φ(i) = j. So, this would require that -j = j, which is only true if the characteristic is 2, but we're in Q8, so no. Thus, this mapping doesn't preserve the group structure. Therefore, this φ is not an automorphism.\n\nHence, not all permutations of the elements of order 4 will work. So, perhaps the automorphism group is smaller than S6 (since there are 6 elements of order 4). But we need to find how Aut(Q8) is structured.\n\nAnother approach is to note that Aut(Q8) acts on the set of elements of order 4. However, since each element of order 4 is part of a pair with its inverse (like i and -i), Aut(Q8) must permute these pairs. There are three such pairs: {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k}. So, Aut(Q8) acts on these three pairs, which suggests a homomorphism from Aut(Q8) to S3. However, the user says the automorphism group is S4, which is of order 24, but S3 is of order 6. So, this suggests that the action is more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe instead of three pairs, there's another structure. Let me think again. Each element of order 4 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4, and in Q8, each such subgroup is {1, -1, i, -i}, similarly for j and k. So, there are three cyclic subgroups of order 4: <i>, <j>, <k>. Any automorphism must permute these subgroups, since automorphisms preserve subgroup structure. Therefore, Aut(Q8) acts on the set {<i>, <j>, <k>}, which has three elements, giving a homomorphism to S3. The kernel of this homomorphism would consist of automorphisms that fix each of these subgroups. But an automorphism that fixes <i> can still send i to i or -i, similarly for <j> and <k>. So, the kernel would be isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2, since for each subgroup, we can invert the generator or not. But then the image in S3 would be some subgroup, so the total automorphism group would be a semidirect product of C2^3 and S3, which has order 8*6=48. But Q8 has only 8 elements, and Aut(Q8) can't be larger than the group of permutations of 8 elements, which is 8! but that's way too big. However, since automorphisms must preserve structure, the actual size is smaller. But we are supposed to get S4, which has order 24. So, my previous approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the automorphism group acts on the three pairs {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k}, and also can swap them. So, each pair can be swapped with another, but also within each pair, you can flip the element. But this would give an automorphism group of S3 × (C2)^3, which is too big. So, this approach isn't matching the expected result of S4.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. The quaternion group Q8 can be realized as a subgroup of GL2(C), consisting of the matrices { ±I, ±iσ_x, ±iσ_y, ±iσ_z }, where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. The automorphism group might then be related to the symmetries of these matrices. However, this might lead back to the geometric interpretation involving the cube, which the user wants to avoid.\n\nLet me try a different algebraic approach. Consider the inner automorphism group Inn(Q8). Since Q8 is non-abelian, Inn(Q8) is non-trivial. The center of Q8 is {1, -1}, so Inn(Q8) is isomorphic to Q8/Z(Q8), which is Q8/{1,-1} ≅ V4, the Klein four-group. So Inn(Q8) has order 4. Therefore, Aut(Q8) must be an extension of Inn(Q8) by the outer automorphism group Out(Q8) = Aut(Q8)/Inn(Q8). So if Aut(Q8) is S4, which has order 24, then Out(Q8) would have order 6. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute Aut(Q8) directly. First, determine the number of automorphisms. An automorphism is determined by where it sends the generators. Suppose we take i and j as generators. Then, φ(i) can be any element of order 4, and φ(j) can be any element of order 4 not in the subgroup generated by φ(i). But in Q8, any two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 intersect at {1, -1}. So, if φ(i) is, say, i, then φ(j) can't be in <i>, so it has to be in <j> or <k>. But φ(j) needs to generate along with φ(i) the whole group. So, if φ(i) = i, then φ(j) can be j, -j, k, or -k. Similarly, if φ(i) = -i, then φ(j) can be j, -j, k, or -k. Similarly, if φ(i) is j, then φ(j) can be i, -i, k, -k, etc.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe instead, let's count the number of automorphisms. For φ(i), there are 6 choices (since there are 6 elements of order 4: i, -i, j, -j, k, -k). Once φ(i) is chosen, φ(j) must be an element of order 4 not in <φ(i)>, so there are 4 choices (since <φ(i)> contains two elements of order 4: φ(i) and -φ(i)). But also, we have to ensure that φ(i) and φ(j) satisfy the same relations as i and j. So, perhaps for each choice of φ(i), there are 2 valid choices for φ(j). Let's check:\n\nSuppose φ(i) = i. Then φ(j) must be an element of order 4 not in <i>, so j, -j, k, -k. But we also need that i and φ(j) anti-commute. Let's see: if φ(j) = j, then ij = k and ji = -k, so they anti-commute. Similarly, if φ(j) = -j, then i*(-j) = -ij = -k, and (-j)*i = -ji = k, so they anti-commute. If φ(j) = k, then i*k = -j and k*i = j, which is -(-j) = j, so they anti-commute? Wait, i*k = -j and k*i = j. So, i*k = - (k*i), which means they anti-commute. Similarly for φ(j) = -k. So, all four choices for φ(j) when φ(i)=i actually satisfy the anti-commute condition. But wait, does that mean that for each φ(i), there are 4 choices of φ(j)? But this would give 6*4=24 automorphisms, which matches the order of S4. Therefore, Aut(Q8) has order 24, which is the same as S4. Therefore, it's plausible that Aut(Q8) ≅ S4.\n\nBut how to show that the group structure is actually S4? Since S4 is the only group of order 24 with certain properties, perhaps by showing that Aut(Q8) has certain elements or structure. Alternatively, consider that the automorphism group acts on the three pairs {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k}, but also can permute the pairs among each other. However, there are three pairs, so permuting them would give a homomorphism to S3. But S4 has a natural action on four elements, so maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that Q8 has 6 elements of order 4, which can be partitioned into three pairs {i, -i}, etc. If we think of these pairs as axes, then permuting the axes and flipping the direction corresponds to automorphisms. However, this would give a group of order 6*4=24, but how does this relate to S4? Alternatively, maybe considering the action on the set of three pairs and some additional structure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that Aut(Q8) acts on the set X consisting of the three elements i, j, k (up to sign). But since automorphisms can permute these elements and also invert them, perhaps the automorphism group is the wreath product of S3 and C2, but that might not be S4.\n\nAlternatively, think of the automorphism group as acting on the 4 maximal subgroups of Q8. Q8 has several subgroups: the trivial group, the center {1, -1}, the three cyclic subgroups of order 4 (<i>, <j>, <k>), and the entire group. The maximal subgroups are the three cyclic subgroups of order 4 and the center. Wait, the center is order 2, so it's minimal, not maximal. The maximal subgroups are the three cyclic subgroups of order 4. So, Aut(Q8) acts on these three subgroups, giving a homomorphism to S3. The kernel of this action would be automorphisms that fix each subgroup, which would allow flipping the generators (i to -i, etc.), giving a kernel of C2×C2×C2. But then the total automorphism group would be the semidirect product of C2^3 by S3, which is order 24, same as S4. But S4 is not a semidirect product of C2^3 by S3. However, S4 does have a normal subgroup isomorphic to the Klein four-group, but that's different.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a different way to see this. The automorphism group S4 can be seen as acting on the four elements {i, j, k, -1}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider that the automorphism group acts on the set of three pairs {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k}, and each automorphism permutes these pairs and possibly flips the signs. If we think of each pair as a coordinate axis, then the automorphism group is isomorphic to the rotational symmetry group of a cube, which is S4. Because the cube has four space diagonals, and the rotational symmetry group acts on those diagonals as S4. But this is the geometric interpretation the user mentioned, which they want to avoid. \n\nBut the user wants an algebraic proof. So, how to link Aut(Q8) to S4 without geometry. Maybe by considering that Aut(Q8) has 24 elements and that S4 is the only group of order 24 with certain properties. For example, S4 has no normal Sylow subgroups, which might be the case for Aut(Q8) as well. However, this requires knowing more about the structure of Aut(Q8).\n\nAlternatively, construct an explicit isomorphism between Aut(Q8) and S4. To do this, we need to find four objects that Aut(Q8) acts on permutatively, leading to a homomorphism to S4. What could those four objects be? In Q8, aside from the three cyclic subgroups of order 4, there's also the center. But the center is a single element (group of order 2), so maybe not. Alternatively, consider the set of three pairs {i, -i}, etc., but that's three objects. Wait, perhaps the six elements of order 4 can be partitioned into three pairs, and Aut(Q8) acts on these, but still three objects. However, S4 acts on four objects. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, recall that S4 can be generated by transpositions, and perhaps certain automorphisms correspond to transpositions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, consider that the automorphism group of Q8 permutes the four Sylow 3-subgroups... Wait, no, Q8 is a 2-group. This might not help.\n\nAnother idea: The group Q8 can be embedded in the multiplicative group of the quaternions, which is a division algebra. The automorphisms of Q8 would then correspond to invertible linear transformations preserving the quaternion structure, but this might again be geometric.\n\nAlternatively, think of Aut(Q8) as isomorphic to SL(3,2), but SL(3,2) has order 168, which is too big. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, let's go back to counting. If Aut(Q8) has 24 elements, and S4 also has 24 elements, then if we can show that Aut(Q8) has no elements of order 6 or higher, but S4 does have elements of order 4 (cycles of length 4), etc. Alternatively, find elements in Aut(Q8) that correspond to transpositions or 3-cycles in S4.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following: each automorphism is determined by its action on i and j, as previously discussed. Since there are 6 choices for φ(i) and 4 choices for φ(j), giving 24 automorphisms. Now, we can model these automorphisms as permutations of the 4 generators {i, j, k, -1} or something else. Wait, but -1 is fixed by automorphisms, so maybe not. Alternatively, think of the images of i, j, k under automorphisms. Since k is determined by i and j, as ij=k, perhaps the automorphism group acts on the set {i, j, k, -i, -j, -k}, but this is six elements. However, since each automorphism must preserve the pairs {i, -i}, etc., the action is on three pairs, which might correspond to S3 × something, but again, this isn't S4.\n\nAnother thought: In S4, the number of elements of order 2 is 9 (transpositions and double transpositions), and in Aut(Q8), the number of involutions (elements of order 2) might be similar. But without knowing the structure of Aut(Q8), this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the isomorphism between Aut(Q8) and S4 can be established by considering the action of Aut(Q8) on the set of three pairs {i, -i}, {j, -j}, {k, -k} and noting that this action is faithful and transitive, leading to S4. But I'm not sure how.\n\nWait, here's an algebraic approach. The automorphism group of Q8 can be shown to be isomorphic to S4 by considering the action on the cosets of a certain subgroup. Alternatively, note that the group Q8 has 6 elements of order 4, and each automorphism permutes these elements. The number of ways to permute them while preserving the group structure gives the automorphism group. However, this permutation action must be faithful and the image must be S4.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each automorphism is determined by how it permutes the three elements i, j, k, up to sign. For example, you can map i to j, j to k, and k to i, which would be a 3-cycle. Or you can swap i and j, which is a transposition. But in S4, transpositions involve swapping two elements, but here, swapping i and j would require adjusting signs to maintain the relations. However, this might not directly correspond.\n\nWait, maybe instead of three elements, there are four objects being permuted. For example, consider the four maximal subgroups of Q8: the three cyclic subgroups of order 4 and the center. But the center is a single subgroup, so that's four subgroups. Wait, Q8 has the following subgroups: {1}, {1,-1}, <i>, <j>, <k>, and Q8 itself. So the maximal subgroups are <i>, <j>, <k>, and {1,-1} is a minimal normal subgroup. Wait, no, {1,-1} is the center, and the three cyclic subgroups are maximal. So there are three maximal subgroups. So acting on three objects gives a homomorphism to S3, but S4 acts on four objects. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 6 elements of order 4 as being the 6 transpositions in S4, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: The automorphism group of Q8 is isomorphic to S4 because both have the same presentation or satisfy the same group-theoretic properties. For example, both are non-abelian, have trivial center, and have certain types of Sylow subgroups. However, I need to verify these properties.\n\nAlternatively, consider specific generators of Aut(Q8) that correspond to the generators of S4. For example, S4 can be generated by transpositions or by adjacent transpositions. If I can find automorphisms of Q8 that behave like these generators, then I can establish an isomorphism.\n\nSuppose we define an automorphism σ that swaps i and j, and adjusts signs as necessary. Let's see: define σ by σ(i)=j, σ(j)=i. Then, σ(k)=σ(ij)=σ(i)σ(j)=j i = -k. So σ(k)=-k. Then, we need to check that all relations are preserved. For example, σ(i)² = j² = -1, which matches σ(i²)=σ(-1)=-1. Similarly, σ(j)² = i² = -1. σ(i)σ(j) = j i = -k = σ(k), which is correct since σ(k) = -k. Similarly, σ(j)σ(i) = i j = k = -σ(k). This seems to work. So σ is an automorphism swapping i and j, and sending k to -k. Similarly, we can define automorphisms swapping i and k, j and k, etc. These would correspond to transpositions in S4.\n\nAdditionally, we can define automorphisms that cycle i→j→k→i. Let's try τ defined by τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, τ(k)=i. Then, τ(k)=τ(ij)=τ(i)τ(j)=j k. But jk = i. So τ(k)=i. But also, τ(k) should be equal to τ(ij)=i. However, in this case, τ(k)=i, which is different from the previous mapping. But let's check consistency. If τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, then τ(k) must be τ(ij)=τ(i)τ(j)=j k = i. Then τ(k)=i. Then, what is τ(i)? It's j. τ(j)=k. τ(k)=i. Then, τ(i²)=τ(-1)=-1=τ(i)²=j²=-1, which works. τ(j²)=k²=-1, also works. τ(ij)=τ(k)=i, which is jk = i, correct. τ(jk)=τ(i)=j, and jk=i, so τ(jk)=τ(i)=j, which matches k*i= j (since τ(jk)=τ(i)=j and jk=i). Wait, let's compute τ(jk). jk = i, so τ(jk)=τ(i)=j. On the other hand, τ(j)τ(k)=k*i= -i*k= -j. Wait, this is a problem. Because τ(jk)=τ(i)=j, but τ(j)τ(k)=k*i= -j. So this doesn't match. Therefore, τ is not a valid automorphism. Hence, a cyclic permutation of i, j, k doesn't work as an automorphism.\n\nHowever, if we adjust signs, maybe we can make it work. Suppose we define τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, τ(k)=-i. Let's check: τ(ij)=τ(k)=-i, and τ(i)τ(j)=j k = i. So τ(ij)= -i, but τ(i)τ(j)=i. This is a discrepancy. So, this doesn't work either. Therefore, a pure cyclic permutation without sign changes doesn't work, and adjusting signs might not resolve it. Hence, perhaps there are no automorphisms of order 3, which would be required for S4 (since S4 has 3-cycles). But this contradicts the earlier count that Aut(Q8) has 24 elements, same as S4. So there must be automorphisms of order 3.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I tried to cycle i→j→k→i, I didn't account for the signs correctly. Let's try another approach. Suppose τ is an automorphism such that τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, τ(k)=i. But as we saw, this leads to inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, τ(k)=l where l is another element. But Q8 only has i, j, k. So this isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the automorphism doesn't cycle the elements but cycles the pairs {i, -i}, etc. For example, an automorphism could map the pair {i, -i} to {j, -j}, {j, -j} to {k, -k}, and {k, -k} to {i, -i}. This would correspond to a 3-cycle in S3 acting on the three pairs. Such an automorphism would have order 3. To construct it, define τ(i)=j, τ(j)=k, τ(k)=i, and τ(-i)=-j, τ(-j)=-k, τ(-k)=-i. Then, check the relations: τ(i)τ(j)=j k = i, which should equal τ(ij)=τ(k)=i. So this works. τ(j)τ(k)=k i = -j, which should equal τ(jk)=τ(i)=j. Wait, this is a problem. Because τ(jk)=τ(i)=j, but τ(j)τ(k)=k i = -j. So, τ(jk)=j vs τ(j)τ(k)= -j. This doesn't match. Hence, this mapping doesn't preserve the group operation. So, such a τ is not an automorphism.\n\nThis suggests that there are no automorphisms of order 3, which would contradict Aut(Q8) being S4, since S4 has elements of order 3. Therefore, my earlier assumption that Aut(Q8) has 24 elements might be incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered that for each φ(i), there are 6 choices, and for each φ(i), 4 choices for φ(j), giving 24 automorphisms, that suggests Aut(Q8) has order 24. If that's accurate, then Aut(Q8) must be S4, since it's the only group of order 24 with the right properties. However, my attempts to construct elements of order 3 are failing, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the automorphism group is indeed S4, but the elements correspond to different permutations. For example, in S4, a transposition swaps two elements and fixes the others, but in Aut(Q8), a transposition-like automorphism might swap two generators and adjust signs, thereby corresponding to a transposition in S4. Alternatively, the four objects that S4 acts on are not the elements of Q8, but something else.\n\nWait, here's a different idea. The group Q8 can be considered as a 2-dimensional vector space over the field with 3 elements, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, consider that the automorphism group of Q8 modulo its inner automorphisms is isomorphic to S3, since Inn(Q8) is V4, and Aut(Q8) has order 24, so 24/4=6, which is S3. But then Out(Q8) is S3, so Aut(Q8) is isomorphic to S4 only if there's a split extension, but Inn(Q8) is V4, and S4 doesn't have a normal V4. Wait, S4 does have a normal Klein four-group, which is its derived subgroup. So, if Inn(Q8) ≅ V4, and Out(Q8) ≅ S3, then Aut(Q8) would be V4 ⋊ S3, which is order 24, and isomorphic to S4. Because S4 can be seen as the semidirect product of V4 and S3, where S3 acts on V4 by permuting the three non-identity elements. But Inn(Q8) is V4, and the action of S3 would come from the outer automorphisms. Therefore, if this semidirect product is isomorphic to S4, then Aut(Q8) ≅ S4.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Well, S4 indeed has a normal Klein four-group, and the quotient S4/V4 is isomorphic to S3. So, if Aut(Q8) fits into this exact sequence 1 → V4 → Aut(Q8) → S3 → 1, and it splits, then Aut(Q8) ≅ V4 ⋊ S3 ≅ S4. Therefore, this would establish the isomorphism.\n\nAlternatively, since Aut(Q8) has order 24 and S4 is the only group of order 24 with a normal Klein four-group, then Aut(Q8) must be S4. But I need to verify that Aut(Q8) indeed has a normal Klein four-group. The inner automorphism group Inn(Q8) is V4, and it's a normal subgroup of Aut(Q8) by definition (since inner automorphisms are normal in the automorphism group). Therefore, since Inn(Q8) ≅ V4 and the quotient group is Out(Q8) ≅ S3, and the extension splits, then Aut(Q8) ≅ S4.\n\nThis seems to be the algebraic proof the user is looking for. It relies on knowing that Inn(Q8) is V4, that Aut(Q8) has order 24, and that the only such group with these properties is S4. However, to make this rigorous, one would need to confirm the order of Aut(Q8), show that the extension splits, and reference the classification of groups of order 24.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n1. Determine that Inn(Q8) ≅ V4.\n2. Show that Out(Q8) = Aut(Q8)/Inn(Q8) ≅ S3.\n3. Demonstrate that the extension splits, hence Aut(Q8) ≅ V4 ⋊ S3 ≅ S4.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic proof involves recognizing the structure of the automorphism group through its normal subgroups and quotient groups, leading to the conclusion that it's isomorphic to S4.",
