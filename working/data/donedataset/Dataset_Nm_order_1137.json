    "Content": "I am stuck on a homework the teacher gave us to hand in. It is stated as following: The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ given by all $q = \\frac{m}{n}$ for some $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $n \\neq 0$ is dense in the real numbers in the following sense:\n  For each real $\\epsilon > 0$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\exists q_{\\epsilon}: |x- q_{\\epsilon}| < \\epsilon$ With the problem, I am given a hint: Prove the statement first for $x > 0$ Let $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ be the set of rational numbers, such that $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{x} \\Rightarrow a \\leq x$. Why is $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ nonempty? Apply the supremum property to $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ and prove that the supremum of $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is $x$ Here my attempts:\nSuppose $x > 0$. Let $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ the set of $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ s.th. $q \\leq x$. (i) Show that $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is nonempty: $ q \\leq x \\Rightarrow \\frac{m}{n} \\leq x \\Rightarrow n \\geq \\frac{m}{x}$. Then by the Archimedian property and the fact that $\\mathbb{N}$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{Z}$ there exists an $n$ for which this is the case, thus $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is nonempty. (ii) Supremum By defintion, $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is a bounded set. Thus, by the supremum property, $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ has a supremum. (iii) Show that $x = sup(\\mathbb{Q}_{x})$ (I am not too certain how to show this, but I think I will get it in time, however, hints are appreciated) But from then on I am stuck. For any x > 0, I can show that there is a set of rational numbers for which x is the supremum. Thus, I can find a rational number arbitratly close to x, making $x-q < \\epsilon$?\nAnd what about $x\\neq0$? How does my result help me there? Thanks for the time and advice! First, thanks for your help. However, I am still in need of some more. I find myself unable to show that if $\\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ is bounded by $x$, $x$ is indeed the supremum of that set. If I suppose that there is a $y < x$ and that that $y$ is an upper bound (in order to prove by contradiction), how can I find a $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{x}$ which is larger than $y$ without using that between any two real numbers, there lies a rational number, which is what I am supposed to show in the first place?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Another way to see that that $\\mathbb Q$ is dense in $\\mathbb R$ is by showing that $\\frac{\\left\\lfloor{nx}\\right\\rfloor}{n}$ is a sequence of rational numbers that converges to $x$ for $n$ goes to infinity. If you want this sequence also helps you to show that $x$ is the supremum of $\\mathbb Q_x$, because $\\frac{\\left\\lfloor{nx}\\right\\rfloor}{n}$ converges to $x$ from below... To be clear the floor function is defined as $\\left\\lfloor{y}\\right\\rfloor:= \n\\max \\{m\\in \\mathbb Z: m \\leq y \\}$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to show that the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, specifically by using the supremum property. The problem statement mentions that for any real number x and any epsilon > 0, there exists a rational number q such that |x - q| < epsilon. The hint suggests proving this first for x > 0 by considering the set Q_x of all rational numbers less than or equal to x and then using the supremum property.\n\nFirst, the user's initial steps: they defined Q_x as the set of rationals ≤ x. They argued that Q_x is nonempty by using the Archimedean property, which makes sense because for any x > 0, you can find a natural number n such that 1/n < x, so 1/n is in Q_x. Then they mentioned that Q_x is bounded (by x), so by the supremum property, it has a supremum, say y. The goal is to show y = x.\n\nThe user is stuck on proving that y = x. They considered a contradiction: suppose y < x. If y is the supremum of Q_x but y < x, then there must be a rational number q in Q_x such that y < q ≤ x. But wait, if y is the supremum, then all elements of Q_x are ≤ y. So if y < x, how can there be a q between y and x? That would require that there's a rational number between y and x, which is exactly what we're trying to prove. So this seems circular. The user is right to be concerned here because you can't use the density of Q in R to prove itself.\n\nTo avoid circularity, we need another approach. Let's recall the Archimedean property: for any real number x, there's an integer n such that n > x. Also, between any two real numbers, there's an integer. Wait, but that's similar to density. Hmm. Maybe use the Archimedean property to find an n such that 1/n < epsilon, then scale x by n to get an integer m, such that m/n is close to x.\n\nWait, the user's original approach via supremum needs to connect. Let's think again. If y is the supremum of Q_x, then y ≤ x (since x is an upper bound). Suppose y < x. Then there exists a rational number q such that y < q < x. But if q < x, then q is in Q_x, which contradicts y being the supremum. Therefore, y must be equal to x. But how do we find such a q without assuming density?\n\nAh, here's the key. Since y < x, the difference x - y is positive. By the Archimedean property, there exists an integer n such that 1/n < x - y. Also, there exists an integer m such that m/n ≤ x. But how do we ensure that m/n is greater than y? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since y is the supremum, for any epsilon > 0, there exists a q in Q_x such that y - epsilon < q ≤ y. But if y < x, then take epsilon = x - y, which is positive. Then there exists q in Q_x such that y - (x - y) < q ≤ y. But y - (x - y) = 2y - x. Not sure if that helps. Wait, maybe this approach isn't right.\n\nWait, the problem is that to show y = x, suppose y < x. Then by the Archimedean property, there's an integer n such that n(x - y) > 1, so 1/n < x - y. Then consider m = floor(n x). Then m/n ≤ x, but m/n must be greater than y. Because m is the largest integer less than or equal to n x. If m/n ≤ y, then m + 1 ≤ n x, but since n x - m > 1 (because n(x - y) > 1 and m ≤ n y), so m + 1 ≤ n x. But then (m + 1)/n > y because m + 1 > n y. Therefore, (m + 1)/n is a rational number in Q_x greater than y, contradicting y being the supremum. Hence y must be x.\n\nThis seems like a way to do it without assuming density. Let's break it down. If y < x, take n such that n(x - y) > 1. Then m = floor(n x) is the greatest integer ≤ n x. Then m/n ≤ x. Also, since n x > m, m/n ≤ x. But also, m + 1 > n x. So (m + 1)/n > x. But since y < x, and n(x - y) > 1, then m + 1 > n x > n y + 1. Therefore, m + 1 > n y + 1 ⇒ m > n y. So m/n > y. But m/n is in Q_x (since m/n ≤ x). Therefore, m/n is a rational number in Q_x greater than y, which contradicts y being the supremum. Therefore, y = x.\n\nTherefore, once we establish that the supremum of Q_x is x, then for any epsilon > 0, there exists a q in Q_x such that x - epsilon < q ≤ x. Hence |x - q| < epsilon. But this gives a q ≤ x. To get a q that might be greater than x, we can similarly consider the set of rationals greater than x and use infimum. Alternatively, since we have q such that x - epsilon < q ≤ x, then |x - q| < epsilon. So this q works. Therefore, density is shown.\n\nFor x ≤ 0, maybe consider x + some positive number and adjust accordingly. But the problem says to first handle x > 0, then extend. So once you have it for x > 0, for x < 0, consider -x > 0, find a q' close to -x, then -q' is close to x. For x = 0, take q = 1/n for n large enough.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. For x > 0, define Q_x = { q ∈ ℚ | q ≤ x }.\n2. Show Q_x is nonempty (by Archimedean property, exists n with 1/n ≤ x).\n3. Q_x is bounded above by x, so by supremum property, exists y = sup Q_x.\n4. Show y = x by contradiction: if y < x, find n such that n(x - y) > 1, then m = floor(nx), so m/n ≤ x and m/n > y, contradicting y being the supremum.\n5. Thus, sup Q_x = x, so for any ε > 0, there's q ∈ Q_x with x - ε < q ≤ x, so |x - q| < ε.\n6. For x ≤ 0, adjust using similar reasoning or by shifting.\n\nThis approach uses the supremum property and Archimedean property without assuming density, thus avoiding circularity.",
