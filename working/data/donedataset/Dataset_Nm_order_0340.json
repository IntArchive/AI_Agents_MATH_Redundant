    "Content": "I'd like to know how can be shown that $\\det(A \\otimes B) = \\det(A)^m \\det(B)^n$ when $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of size $n$ and $m$ respectively and $\\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product of $A$ and $B$. I've seen some proofs using eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$, but since not every matrix has eigenvalues (at least not in all rings), I'd like a more intrinsic proof, maybe using the fact that $M_{(nm)^2} \\cong M_{n^2} \\otimes M_{m^2}$. It all comes down to showing that $\\det(A \\otimes I) = \\det(A)^m$ and using some smart property (e.g. $(A\\otimes B)(C\\otimes D) = (AC) \\otimes (BD)$), but I wasn't able to do even that.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's another approach. Consider $A \\otimes {\\bf 1}_m$, we will show that this matrix can always be brought to the block form $$\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cccc} A & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \n0 & A & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cdots & \\cdots & A \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\nTo this end consider the matrix $A$ with components $(a_{ij})$ in some basis, say $\\{u_i\\}$ of a vector space $V$ with dimension $n$ over a ring $R$. Consider also the identity ${\\bf 1}_m$ over the vector space $W$ of dimension $m$ over $R$ also. We will use the basis $\\{ u_i \\otimes e_a \\}$ for the space $V \\otimes W$, being $i,j=1,\\cdots,n$ and $a,b=1, \\cdots, m$. Let us further choose an ordering for the basis, this ordering will be $$\n\\{u_1 \\otimes e_1, u_1\\otimes e_2, \\cdots ,u_1 \\otimes e_m, u_2 \\otimes e_1, \\cdots ,u_n \\otimes e_m \\}\n$$\nLet us look at the form of the operator $A \\otimes {\\bf 1}_m$ in this basis, we shall see that it is the block form given above. Consider the action: $$\n(A \\otimes {\\bf 1}_m)u_{i}\\otimes e_a = Au_i \\otimes {\\bf 1}_m e_a = \\sum_{j,b} a_{ij}\\delta_{ab} u_j \\otimes e_b\n$$\nThis means that the matrix element in this basis is $(A \\otimes {\\bf 1}_m)_{ia,jb} = a_{ij}\\delta_{ab}$. This is the block form we are aiming to get, for notice that this matrix element is only distinct of zero when $a=b$, that is along the diagonal of a $m \\times m$ block matrix, and in each block one has the matrix $(a_{ij})$, which is the operator $A$ in the basis $\\{u_i\\}$. The determinant is independent of the basis chosen. Now take the determinant of this block matrix, it is easy to show that this determinant is $\\det(A)^m$. Finally, as you pointed out yourself write $$\nA \\otimes B = (A \\otimes {\\bf 1})({\\bf 1}\\otimes B)\n$$\nand use $\\det(MN) = \\det M \\cdot \\det N$. This works with any ring.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that the determinant of the Kronecker product of two matrices A and B is equal to (det A)^m times (det B)^n, where A is n x n and B is m x m. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem statement.\n\nThe user mentions that A and B are square matrices of size n and m respectively. So that's two separate assumptions. Then, the Kronecker product is involved, which is denoted by ⊗. The problem is to show the determinant formula. The user also refers to properties like (A⊗B)(C⊗D) = (AC)⊗(BD), but those might be part of the problem-solving steps rather than assumptions. \n\nWait, the problem statement itself says \"when A and B are square matrices of size n and m respectively\". So the key assumptions here are the sizes of A and B. Additionally, they might be working over a ring where eigenvalues aren't necessarily available, but the user wants an intrinsic proof. However, the assumptions for the problem itself are just the sizes of the matrices and that they are square. The other parts are about the approach desired, but maybe not part of the problem's assumptions. \n\nSo, in the Assumption section, I need to list each assumption line by line. Each line is one property for one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix of size n,\nB is a square matrix of size m,\nThe Kronecker product operation is defined as usual.\n\nWait, but the Kronecker product is a standard operation, so maybe that's not an assumption but part of the problem's context. The problem is to prove the determinant formula given the sizes of A and B. So the main assumptions are about the matrices being square of those sizes. \n\nThe user also mentions wanting to use properties like (A⊗B)(C⊗D) = (AC)⊗(BD), but that's part of the properties of Kronecker products, which are general and might not be assumptions but known properties. The problem is just to use those properties to show the determinant formula.\n\nTherefore, the Assumption section should list:\n\n- A is a square matrix of size n\n- B is a square matrix of size m\n- The determinant is defined for square matrices (but that's inherent, maybe not necessary to state)\n- Kronecker product is defined for matrices A and B (but again, standard)\n\nBut according to the example, the user's original problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in the example, the assumptions are properties of the objects in the problem. Translating that here, the matrices A and B have specific sizes. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix of size n,\nB is a square matrix of size m.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A ⊗ B) = (det A)^m (det B)^n.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user reformatted it to include that. However, in the problem here, the user didn't specify any additional conditions on A and B other than their sizes. So perhaps the assumptions are just their sizes and being square matrices.\n\nSo the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix of size n,\nB is a square matrix of size m.\n\nProblem: Prove that det(A ⊗ B) = (det A)^m (det B)^n.\n\nBut let me check the original question again. The user says \"when A and B are square matrices of size n and m respectively\". So that's the condition. The problem is to show the determinant formula under those conditions. There are no other explicit assumptions given. The rest of the user's question talks about methods of proof, but those aren't part of the problem's assumptions. So yes, the assumptions are just the sizes of A and B.",
