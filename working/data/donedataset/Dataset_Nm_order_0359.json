    "AcceptedAnswer": "Sorry to resurrect, but we leave a $($detailed$)$ proof here that $TM$ has the structure of an oriented $2n$-manifold, even if the $n$-manifold $M$ is non-orientable. Let $\\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be a smooth atlas of $M$, and let $V_\\alpha = \\phi_\\alpha(U_\\alpha) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $(\\phi_\\alpha)_*: TU_\\alpha \\to TV_\\alpha = V_\\alpha \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a homomorphism $($having inverse $(\\phi_\\alpha^{-1})_*$$)$. Moreover, the sets $TU_\\alpha$ cover $TM$ and the transition maps$$t_{\\alpha\\beta} = (\\phi_\\alpha)_* \\circ \\left(\\phi_\\beta^{-1}\\right)_* = \\left(\\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1}\\right)_*: V_\\beta \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to V_\\alpha \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$$are orientation preserving. Let $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ be coordinates on $V_\\beta$, $x_{n+1}, \\dots, x_{2n}$ be coordinates on the left copy of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ be coordinates on $V_\\alpha$, and $y_{n+1}, \\dots, y_{2n}$ be coordinates on the right copy of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Note that $(y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\phi_\\alpha\\left(\\phi_\\beta^{-1}(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\right)$ does not depend on $x_{n+1}, \\dots, x_{2n}$, so the Jacobian matrix $\\left({{\\partial y_i}\\over{\\partial x_j}}\\right)$ of $t_{\\alpha\\beta}$ has all zeros in the upper right quadrant. It follows that$$\\det\\left({{\\partial y_i}\\over{\\partial x_j}}\\right)_{i,j = 1}^{2n} = \\det\\left({{\\partial y_i}\\over{\\partial x_j}}\\right)_{i, j = 1}^n \\det\\left({{\\partial y_i}\\over{\\partial x_j}}\\right)_{i, j = n +1}^{2n}.$$The first of these submatrices is the usual Jacobian of $\\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1}$. The second is the Jacobian of the linear transformation $\\left(\\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1}\\right)_{*,\\, (x_1, \\dots, x_n)}$. Therefore$$\\det\\left({{\\partial y_i}\\over{\\partial x_j}}\\right)_{i, j = 1}^{2n} = \\det\\left(\\left(\\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1}\\right)_{*,\\, (x_1, \\dots, x_n)}\\right)^2 > 0.$$This proves $\\{(TU_\\alpha, (\\phi_\\alpha)_*)\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ is an oriented atlas for $TM$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange about the tangent bundle being orientable.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Why is the tangent bundle orientable?\" and the question body says: \"Let M be a smooth manifold. How do I show that the tangent bundle TM of M is orientable?\"\n\nSo the main problem is to prove that the tangent bundle TM of a smooth manifold M is orientable. Now, I need to list the assumptions. The example given in the prompt had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem here, the assumptions would be about the properties of M and TM. The original problem states that M is a smooth manifold. That's one assumption. Then, TM is the tangent bundle of M. Another assumption. Are there any other implicit assumptions? The problem doesn't mention anything else, like M being orientable itself. Wait, but in the example, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem's original statement. But in this case, the original problem only says M is a smooth manifold. The question is about TM being orientable regardless of M's orientability. So the assumptions are just that M is a smooth manifold, and TM is its tangent bundle. The problem is to show TM is orientable. So I need to list those two as separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the user wrote \"Let M be a smooth manifold. How do I show that TM is orientable?\" So the only explicit assumption is that M is a smooth manifold. But TM is the tangent bundle of M, which is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. The problem is about showing TM is orientable, given that M is a smooth manifold. So the assumption is that M is a smooth manifold. The problem is to show TM is orientable.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the divisibility by 7 isn't an assumption but part of what needs to be proven. Maybe the example had an error. But perhaps in the user's example, they modified the problem to include an extra assumption? Hmm. Maybe the example was from a different problem. Anyway, regardless of that, I need to follow the instructions.\n\nSo for the current problem, the original question says \"Let M be a smooth manifold. How do I show that TM is orientable?\" So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. M is a smooth manifold.\n\nBut TM is the tangent bundle of M, which is part of the problem's setup. So maybe another assumption is that TM is the tangent bundle associated with M. But in the problem statement, the user is referring to TM as the tangent bundle of M, so perhaps that's not an assumption but part of the problem's definition. Wait, the example had \"A(n) = ...\", which was part of the problem statement. So in this case, the problem is to show that TM (which is the tangent bundle of M) is orientable. So the only assumption is that M is a smooth manifold.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nM is a smooth manifold.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the tangent bundle TM of M is orientable.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another implicit assumption. For example, sometimes orientability of the manifold itself can affect the tangent bundle's orientability. But the problem here is to show that the tangent bundle is always orientable, regardless of whether M is orientable. So the only assumption needed is that M is a smooth manifold, not necessarily orientable. Therefore, the assumption is just that M is a smooth manifold. The problem is to show that its tangent bundle is orientable.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$M$ is a smooth manifold.\nProblem: \nProve that the tangent bundle $TM$ of $M$ is orientable.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\nYes, that seems correct. The user's example had two assumptions, but in this case, there's only one assumption. The example might have had a different context where more assumptions were present. But here, the problem only states that M is a smooth manifold, and the task is to show that its tangent bundle is orientable. So only one assumption is needed.",
