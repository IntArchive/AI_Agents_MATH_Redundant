    "Content": "Let $f\\in \\mathbb{Z}[X]$ such that $|f(x)|<1, \\forall x\\in (-2, 2)$ . Prove that $f=0$ . I couldn't make too much progress on this problem. I tried considering $f=a_nX^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+...+a_1X+a_0$ and by setting $x=0$ in the hypothesis I got that $|a_0|<1$ and this doesn't look useful. Then I thought about looking at $f$ 's degree, but I couldn't make any observations on this. I believe that the key of the problem should be that the polynomial's coefficients are integers, but I don't know how to use that. Apart from the Rational Root Theorem (which doesn't seem useful here) I don't have in mind other results regarding polynomials with integer coefficients.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I can provide you with an answer based on Chebyshev polynomials. Suppose that $f$ satisfies the stated assumptions, let $k$ be the degree of $f$ , such that we have $a_k \\neq 0$ and define $g(x) := f(x)/a_k$ . As $a_k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ we must have $|a_k|\\geq 1$ and therefore $|g(x)| = |f(x)/a_k| < 1$ for $x \\in (-2,2)$ . Define the $n$ -th Chebyshev polynomial $$ T_n(x) := \\cos(n\\arccos(x)) $$ on $[-1,1]$ . Note that $2^{1-n}T_n(x)$ has minimal supremum norm among all monic polynomials of degree $n$ on $[-1,1]$ for $n \\geq 1$ ( see here ). By a rescaling argument, it follows that $2T_n(x/2)$ has minimal supremum norm among all monic polynomials of degree $n$ on $[-2,2]$ for $n \\geq 1$ . It is easy to see from the definition that for $n \\geq 1$ it holds that $$\\sup_{x \\in [-2,2]} 2|T_n(x/2)| = 2.$$ By continuity of $g$ , we have $$\\sup_{x \\in [-2,2]} |g(x)| \\leq 1,$$ and therefore we must have $k < 1$ , as otherwise we would have found a monic polynomial with smaller supremum norm than the Chebyshev polynomial of the corresponding degree, a contradiction. It follows that $g$ is constant and therefore equal to $\\frac{a_0}{a_k}$ . Because of $|f(0)| < 1$ we must have $|a_0| < 1$ and as $a_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ it follows that $a_0 = 0$ , therefore $g \\equiv 0 $ and hence $f \\equiv 0$ , which contradicts the assumption that $a_k \\neq 0$ . Therefore, the only polynomial satisfying the hypotheses is the zero polynomial.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem states that if a polynomial f with integer coefficients satisfies |f(x)| < 1 for all x in the interval (-2, 2), then f must be the zero polynomial. Hmm, interesting. I need to prove that the only such polynomial is the zero polynomial.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The assumptions are:\n\n1. f is in ℤ[X], meaning all its coefficients are integers.\n2. For every x in (-2, 2), the absolute value of f(x) is less than 1.\n3. We need to conclude that f is identically zero.\n\nThe user tried plugging x=0 and found that |a₀| < 1. Since a₀ is an integer, this implies a₀=0. That's a start. Then maybe consider other integer values of x within (-2, 2). Wait, but x is a real number in that interval, not necessarily integer. So x can be fractions, etc. But maybe evaluating at integer points within that interval? The only integer in (-2, 2) is -1, 0, 1. So maybe plugging x=1 and x=-1?\n\nLet's see. If x=1, then |f(1)| < 1. Since f(1) is an integer because coefficients are integers and x=1. Therefore, f(1) must be 0. Similarly, x=-1: |f(-1)| <1 implies f(-1)=0. Also x=0: f(0) is a₀, which must be 0 as |a₀|<1 and integer. So f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f(-1)=0. But a polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots unless it's the zero polynomial. If we have three roots, but the polynomial's degree could be higher. Wait, but maybe we can use more points?\n\nBut the interval is (-2, 2), so maybe there are other points we can use. However, the problem states that |f(x)| <1 for all x in that interval, not just integers. So perhaps considering the maximum modulus on that interval. But how to relate that to integer coefficients?\n\nWait, there's a theorem related to polynomials bounded on intervals with integer coefficients. I recall something called the Polynomial Factor Theorem or maybe Integer Polynomial Bounds. Alternatively, perhaps using Chebyshev polynomials, which are known for their minimal maximum deviation on intervals. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if f is not the zero polynomial, then it must have some non-zero coefficient. Let's suppose f has degree n. Then, for large x, the leading term dominates. But here x is restricted to (-2, 2), so maybe considering the maximum possible value of f(x) in that interval. But how does that relate to the coefficients?\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that the coefficients are integers and the polynomial is bounded by 1 on (-2, 2). Let's consider the Taylor coefficients or Fourier coefficients? Maybe not. Alternatively, use induction on the degree of the polynomial.\n\nBase case: degree 0. Then f is a constant polynomial, which must be 0 since |a₀| <1 and a₀ is integer. So a₀=0. So base case holds.\n\nAssume that all polynomials of degree less than k with integer coefficients satisfying |f(x)| <1 on (-2, 2) must be zero. Now consider a polynomial of degree k. If such a polynomial exists, then perhaps we can factor out (x - a) terms, but we need to show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if f has integer coefficients, then the differences f(1) - f(0) must be an integer. But f(1) and f(0) are both integers, so their difference is integer. But since |f(1)| <1 and |f(0)| <1, then f(1)=f(0)=0. So the difference is 0. But maybe this isn't helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: use the fact that if f is non-zero, then it must have some minimal degree, and then evaluate at enough points to force coefficients to zero. For example, since f(0)=0, then a₀=0. Then f(x) = x g(x), where g has integer coefficients. Then |x g(x)| <1 for all x in (-2, 2). So |g(x)| <1/|x| for all x in (-2, 2) except x=0. But as x approaches 0, |g(x)| must approach |g(0)|, which is |a₁| (since a₀=0, f(x)=a₁ x + a₂ x² + ...). So |a₁ x| <1 near x=0 implies |a₁| < 1/|x| for x near 0. But as x approaches 0, 1/|x| approaches infinity, which doesn't give a constraint. Wait, but actually, since f(x) = x g(x), and |f(x)| <1 for all x in (-2, 2). So for x ≠ 0, |g(x)| <1/|x|. Now, take x=1: |g(1)| <1/1=1. But g(1) is integer (since coefficients are integers and x=1), so g(1)=0. Similarly, x=-1: |g(-1)| <1/1=1, so g(-1)=0. Then g(x) has roots at 1 and -1, so g(x) = (x² -1) h(x), where h has integer coefficients. Then f(x)=x(x² -1)h(x). Now, |f(x)| = |x(x² -1) h(x)| <1 for all x in (-2, 2). Then |h(x)| <1/( |x(x² -1)| ). Now, consider x approaching sqrt(1) from below, but maybe evaluate at x=2? Wait, but x is in (-2, 2). So consider x=3/2. Then |x(x² -1)| = (3/2)(9/4 -1) = (3/2)(5/4)=15/8 ≈1.875. So |h(3/2)| <1/(15/8)=8/15≈0.533. But h has integer coefficients. So h evaluated at 3/2 is a sum of terms like a_k (3/2)^k. But unless h is zero, this sum would have a magnitude of at least some minimal value. Wait, but h(3/2) must be less than 8/15≈0.533. However, since h has integer coefficients, maybe h(3/2) can't be that small unless h is zero.\n\nAlternatively, let's take x=1/2. Then |x(x² -1)| = (1/2)(1/4 -1) = (1/2)(-3/4)= 3/8. So |h(1/2)| <1/(3/8)=8/3≈2.666. But h(1/2) is a sum of terms a_k (1/2)^k, which is a sum of fractions. But since h has integer coefficients, h(1/2) could be any real number, but perhaps using the fact that h(1) and h(-1) must be integers?\n\nWait, maybe use induction again. Suppose h is a polynomial with integer coefficients. If we can show that |h(x)| must be less than some bound, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that h(x) must also satisfy |h(x)| <1/( |x(x² -1)| ) for all x in (-2,2). But the minimal value of |x(x² -1)| in (-2,2) occurs near x=0, x=1, x=-1. Wait, but near x=0, |x(x² -1)| ≈ |x|, so 1/(|x(x² -1)| ) ≈1/|x|, which goes to infinity as x approaches 0. So near zero, h(x) can be anything? But h(x) is a polynomial, so it's continuous. But h(x) must be bounded near x=0. Wait, but if h(x) is non-zero, then near x=0, h(x) approaches h(0), which is the constant term. Since h has integer coefficients, h(0) is an integer. But |h(x)| must be less than 1/( |x(x² -1)| ) near x=0. As x approaches 0, the right-hand side approaches infinity, so h(0) can be any integer? But wait, no, because for x approaching 0, |x(x² -1)| ≈ |x|, so 1/(|x|). So |h(x)| <1/|x| near 0. But h(x) near 0 is approximately h(0) + h'(0) x + ... So |h(0) + h'(0) x + ... | <1/|x|. Multiply both sides by |x|: |x h(0) + h'(0) x² + ... | <1. Taking the limit as x approaches 0, the left side approaches 0, which is always less than 1. But this doesn't constrain h(0). So maybe h(0) can be any integer? But if h(0) is non-zero, say h(0)=k where k is integer, then near x=0, |h(x)| ≈ |k|. But |h(x)| must also be less than 1/(|x(x² -1)| ) ≈1/|x|. So near x=0, |k| <1/|x|. But as x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large, so this inequality would hold for sufficiently small x only if k=0. Because if k≠0, then for |x| <1/|k|, |k| <1/|x| would imply |x| <1/|k|, but as x approaches 0, this would require |k| <1/|x|, which can't hold for |x| approaching 0. Hence, to satisfy |h(x)| <1/|x(x² -1)| near x=0, we must have h(0)=0. Therefore, the constant term of h is 0.\n\nSo h(x) = x m(x), where m has integer coefficients. Then f(x)=x(x² -1) h(x) =x(x² -1) x m(x)=x²(x² -1) m(x). Continuing this process, each time we factor out more x terms. But this can't continue indefinitely unless f is the zero polynomial. Hence, by induction, f must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: starting with f(0)=0, so factor out x. Then f(x)=x g(x). Now g(x) must also satisfy |g(x)| <1/|x| in (-2,2). Then evaluating g at x=1 gives |g(1)| <1, but g(1) is integer, so g(1)=0. Similarly, g(-1)=0. So g(x) has factors (x-1)(x+1). Then f(x)=x(x-1)(x+1) h(x). Now, h(x) must satisfy |h(x)| <1/( |x(x² -1)| ). Again, evaluating at x=2 is outside the interval, but consider x approaching 1. For example, x=1/2: |x(x² -1)| = (1/2)(1/4 -1)= (1/2)(-3/4)=3/8. So |h(1/2)| <8/3≈2.666. But h has integer coefficients. However, h evaluated at 1/2 would be a sum of terms a_k (1/2)^k. If h is non-zero, then this sum would have to be a fraction with denominator 2^m for some m. But since h has integer coefficients, h(1/2) is a rational number with denominator 2^m. But how small can it be? If h(1/2) is non-zero, its absolute value is at least 1/2^m, but depending on the coefficients. This might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if f is non-zero, then it must have some minimal degree, and then use the maximum modulus on the interval. For polynomials with integer coefficients, there's a result that if a polynomial of degree n has max |f(x)| on [-a, a] less than 1/( (2a)^n ), then f must be zero. But I'm not sure about the exact statement.\n\nWait, there's a lemma called the \"Integer Coefficient Polynomial Lemma\" which states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients satisfies |f(x)| <1 on [-k, k], where k is a positive integer, then f must be the zero polynomial. But here our interval is (-2,2), which is similar to k=2, but it's not closed. However, since the interval is open, but the polynomial is continuous, the maximum on the closed interval [-2,2] would be the same as the supremum on (-2,2). So if |f(x)| <1 on (-2,2), then on [-2,2] the maximum is less than or equal to 1. But we need to connect this to the coefficients.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that the coefficients can be recovered via derivatives. For example, f(0)=a₀=0, f'(0)=a₁, f''(0)=2!a₂, etc. But since |f(x)| <1 near x=0, maybe use Taylor series and bound the coefficients. However, for integer coefficients, the derivatives at 0 must be integers multiplied by factorials. For example, a₁ = f'(0), which must be integer. Similarly, a₂ = f''(0)/2!, which must be integer, etc. But how does |f(x)| <1 imply bounds on the derivatives?\n\nAlternatively, use induction on the degree. Suppose f has degree n. If we can show that all coefficients must be zero, starting from the lowest degree. We already have a₀=0. Then consider a₁. Take the derivative at 0: f'(0)=a₁. Since |f(x)| <1 for all x near 0, the slope at 0 must be bounded. Specifically, |f(x)/x| = |a₁ + a₂x + ...| <1/|x| for x near 0. As x approaches 0, the right-hand side goes to infinity, so this doesn't directly bound a₁. However, since a₁ must be an integer, perhaps using other points.\n\nWait, if we consider x=1/2. Then f(1/2) = a₁*(1/2) + a₂*(1/2)^2 + ... + a_n*(1/2)^n. Since |f(1/2)| <1, and all coefficients are integers, this sum must be a fraction with denominator 2^n. But the absolute value is less than 1. Similarly, for x=1/3, etc. But how to relate this.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial evaluated at multiple points and set up a system of equations. For example, using x=0,1,-1, we already have f(0)=f(1)=f(-1)=0. So f(x) must be divisible by x(x-1)(x+1). Then f(x)=x(x-1)(x+1)g(x), where g has integer coefficients. Then |x(x-1)(x+1)g(x)| <1 for all x in (-2,2). Now, let's evaluate at x=3/2. Then |3/2*(9/4 -1)|*|g(3/2)| = |3/2*(5/4)|*|g(3/2)| = 15/8 |g(3/2)| <1. Thus |g(3/2)| <8/15≈0.533. But g has integer coefficients. Let's see what g(3/2) is. Since g(x) is an integer polynomial, g(3/2) is a sum of terms a_k*(3/2)^k. Each term a_k*(3/2)^k must be a multiple of 1/2^k. So the sum would have a denominator dividing 2^k. To get a sum with absolute value less than 8/15, which is approximately 0.533, the only way is if all a_k=0. Because if any a_k is non-zero, since coefficients are integers, then the term a_k*(3/2)^k would be at least (1)*(3/2)^k / 2^k ? Wait, not sure. For example, if g(x)=a, a constant integer. Then |a|*(15/8) <1 implies |a| <8/15≈0.533, so a=0. If g(x)=a x + b, then |(3/2 a + b)|*(15/8) <1. But since a and b are integers, the expression (3/2 a + b) must be zero to make the product less than 1. Hence, 3/2 a + b=0. Multiply by 2: 3a +2b=0. Since a and b are integers, 3a = -2b. So 2 divides 3a, implying 2 divides a. Let a=2k, then 3*2k +2b=0 ⇒ 6k +2b=0 ⇒ b= -3k. Thus, g(x)=2k x -3k =k(2x -3). But then evaluating at x=1/2: |(1/2)( (1/2)^2 -1 ) g(1/2)| = |(1/2)( -3/4 ) g(1/2)| = | -3/8 g(1/2)| <1 ⇒ |g(1/2)| <8/3≈2.666. But g(1/2)=k(2*(1/2) -3)=k(1 -3)= -2k. So | -2k | <8/3 ⇒ |k| <4/3. Since k is integer, k=0. Hence, g(x)=0. Therefore, f(x)=0.\n\nThis seems to work. So inductively, by factoring out roots and showing that each subsequent polynomial must also vanish, leading to f=0.\n\nSo the key steps are:\n\n1. Evaluate at integer points in (-2,2), which are -1,0,1, leading to f(-1)=f(0)=f(1)=0.\n2. Factor f(x) as x(x-1)(x+1)g(x).\n3. Evaluate at x=3/2, leading to g(3/2)=0 because |g(3/2)| <8/15 and g has integer coefficients, implying g(3/2) must be zero.\n4. Repeat the process, but this seems to require infinitely many roots unless g is zero.\n5. Therefore, by induction, f must be the zero polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity theorem for analytic functions, but since polynomials are analytic, having infinitely many zeros would imply it's zero everywhere. But we only have a few zeros. However, by repeatedly factoring out linear terms, we can show that all coefficients must vanish.\n\nIn summary, the problem relies on evaluating the polynomial at specific points (like integers within the interval) to force certain coefficients to zero, then factoring and repeating the process until all coefficients are shown to be zero.",
