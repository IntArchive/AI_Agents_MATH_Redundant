    "Content": "Fraleigh, Sec31, Ex9. Show that $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\sqrt[3]{3}):\\mathbb{Q}]=9$. Here is my trial: It is obvious that $\\sqrt[3]2$ is algebraic of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$, since $x^3-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein crieterion with $p=2$. Then we need to show that $\\sqrt[3]3$ is algebraic of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]2)$. Since $\\sqrt[3]3$ is a zero of $x^3-3$, its degree is at most 3. To show that $\\sqrt[3]3$ is not of degree 1, i.e. $\\sqrt[3]3 \\not\\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]2)$, suppose that $\\sqrt[3]3=a+b\\sqrt[3]2+c\\sqrt[3]4$, where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. (The usual degree argument is not available since $\\deg(\\sqrt[3]3,\\mathbb{Q})=3$ divides $\\deg(\\sqrt[3]2,\\mathbb{Q})=3$.) Cubing both sides, $3=p+q\\sqrt[3]2+r\\sqrt[3]4$ with some $p, q, r$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $\\sqrt[3]2$ is a zero of $rx^2+qx+p-3$, which is a contradiction to $\\deg(\\sqrt[3]2,\\mathbb{Q})=3$. Now to prove $\\sqrt[3]3$ is not of degree 2, suppose that $\\sqrt[3]3$ is a zero of quadratic polynomial. This means that $\\sqrt[3]9=p\\sqrt[3]3+q$ for some $p,q \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]2)$. Cubing both sides, $9=3p^3+q^3+3p\\sqrt[3]3q(\\sqrt[3]3p+q)=3p^3+q^3+9pq:=a+b\\sqrt[3]2+c\\sqrt[3]4$ for some $a,b,c\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, which leads to the same contradiction. Actually I didn't know how to solve it but while writing out this question, it seems that I solved the problem. But is the above solution right? And is there any other way to solve it? At first, I tried to show that $x=\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{3}$ is algebraic of degree 9 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Cubing yields that $x^3=5+3 \\sqrt[3]{6}x$, so $(x^3-5)^3=162x^3$, so $x^9-15x^6-87x^3-125=0$ has $\\sqrt[3]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{3}$ as a zero. But I couldn't show that it is irreducible (Eisenstein criterion with $p=5$ fails.) Edit: As Alex pointed out, it is sufficient to show that $x^3-3$ has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$. And as Gerry pointed out, this process some more work than the above(check the nonzero condition). Suppose $(a+b\\sqrt[3]2+c\\sqrt[3]4)^3=3$. I did the heavy computation, $a^3+2b^3+4c^3+12abc+3\\sqrt[3]2(a^2b+2b^2c+2c^2a)+3\\sqrt[3]4(a^2c+b^2a+2c^2b)=3$, and stuck on here. How can I proceed here?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Just a remark/simplification: if the polynomial $x^3 - 3$ is not irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$, then at least one of the factors must be linear (this is a special nice feature of degree $\\leq 3$ of course). So, it is enough to show that this polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$, you don't need to check the quadratic case separately. The roots of that polynomial over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ are of course $\\omega^i\\sqrt[3]{3}$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity and $0\\leq i\\leq 2$. So, you just apply the first step of your argument to all these roots at the same time and save yourself the second step. Edit: To finish the first step, suppose for a contradiction that you have\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na^3 + 2b^3 + 4c^3 + 12abc & = & 3,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(1) \\\\ a^2b+2b^2c + 2c^2a & = & 0,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(2)\\\\\na^2c+b^2a+2c^2b & = & 0.\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(3)\n\\end{align}\n$$\nFirst, multiply through by the lcm of the denominators of $a,b,c$ to make them integers, so the equations become\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na^3 + 2b^3 + 4c^3 + 12abc & = & 3d^3,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(1) \\\\ a^2b+2b^2c + 2c^2a & = & 0,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(2)\\\\\na^2c+b^2a+2c^2b & = & 0.\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(3)\n\\end{align}\n$$\nWe may assume without loss of generality that $a,b,c$ are coprime, otherwise divide through by the highest common factor. Step 1: First, I claim that $a$ (and therefore also $d$, but that doesn't matter) is odd. Indeed, let's look at equation (1):\n$$\n2|a\\Rightarrow 8|RHS\\Rightarrow \\text{ and }LHS\\equiv 2b^3\\pmod 4\\Rightarrow 2|b\\Rightarrow LHS\\equiv 4c^3\\pmod 8\\Rightarrow 2|c.\n$$\nThis contradicts coprimality of $a,b,c$, so $a$ is odd. Step 2: With this information, we will consider (2) and (3) modulo higher and higher powers of 2: (2) modulo 2 forces $b$ to be even. This in turn means that (3) forces $c$ to be even. Now, we will alternate between the two equations. If $c$ is even then (2) $\\Rightarrow4|b$. Thus, (3) $\\Rightarrow4|c$. But then (2) $\\Rightarrow 8|b$. And so on. This will never stop. Since $b$ and $c$ cannot be divisible by arbitrarily large powers of 2, we obtain a contradiction. This is a variant of Fermat's infinite descent. Note that I could have phrase Step 2 in a finite way: write $b=2^nu$, $c=2^mv$ with $u$ and $v$ odd, obtain inequalities between $n$ and $m$ that contradict each other. Equally well, I could have phrased Step 1 in the language of infinite descent, without assuming coprimality at the outset. However, the cleanest formulation would have been obtained by using $p$-adic valuations. Recall that given a prime $p$ and a rational number $x$, if we write $x=p^n\\frac{r}{s}$, where $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $p\\nmid r,s$, then the $p$-adic valuation of $x$ is defined as $\\text{val}_p(x) = n$. The fundamental property of the valuation is that\n$$\n\\text{val}_p\\left(\\sum_i x_i\\right)\\geq \\text{min}(\\text{val}_p(x_i))_i;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(4)$$ moreover, if there exists $x_0$ such that $\\text{val}_p(x_0)<\\text{val}_p(x_i)$ for all $i\\neq 0$, then we have equality in (4). I propose it as an exercise for the reader to rephrase both steps above in the language of valuations, using these two properties. Note, that you then don't care whether $a,b,c$ are integers or rationals.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about showing that the degree of the field extension Q(³√2, ³√3) over Q is 9. The user provided an example where they broke down the assumptions and restated the problem. I need to do the same here.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The main goal is to show the degree of the extension is 9. The user mentions that √[3]{2} is algebraic of degree 3 over Q because x³ - 2 is irreducible by Eisenstein with p=2. Then they need to show that √[3]{3} is algebraic of degree 3 over Q(√[3]{2}). The problem here is proving that √[3]{3} isn't in Q(√[3]{2}) and that its minimal polynomial over that field is degree 3.\n\nSo the assumptions would be about the degrees of the extensions. Each assumption should be a single condition on one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q (so [Q(³√2) : Q] = 3).\n2. The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q (so [Q(³√3) : Q] = 3).\n3. We need to show that x³ - 3 remains irreducible over Q(³√2). If that's true, then the degree [Q(³√2, ³√3) : Q(³√2)] = 3, and by the tower law, the total degree is 3*3=9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the user is trying to show that √[3]{3} has degree 3 over Q(³√2). So the key assumption is that x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q(³√2). The user's approach assumes that if it were reducible, it would have a root in Q(³√2), which they then try to contradict by supposing ³√3 can be expressed in terms of ³√2 and ³√4 (which are the basis elements of Q(³√2) over Q).\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- Q(³√2) is a field extension of Q of degree 3.\n- x³ - 3 is the minimal polynomial of ³√3 over Q.\n- To apply the tower law, we need that [Q(³√2, ³√3) : Q(³√2)] = 3, which requires x³ - 3 to be irreducible over Q(³√2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions to list would be:\n\n1. The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n2. The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\n3. The element ³√3 is not in Q(³√2).\n\nBut the problem's original statement is just to show the degree is 9. The user's trial includes some assumptions, but the key points are that each step's irreducibility is maintained. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The field extension Q(³√2) over Q has degree 3.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 remains irreducible over Q(³√2).\n\nBut in the problem, the user is asking to verify their proof, which involves showing that ³√3 is not expressible in Q(³√2). Therefore, the problem's assumptions are that Q(³√2) is a degree 3 extension, and that ³√3 is algebraic of degree 3 over Q, and that we need to show it's also degree 3 over Q(³√2), leading to the total degree 9.\n\nBut according to the example given, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\n- The element √[3]{3} is not in Q(√[3]{2}).\n\nWait, but the irreducibility of x³ - 3 over Q is given by Eisenstein with p=3, right? So that's an assumption. Then the irreducibility over Q(√[3]{2}) is what needs to be shown. But the problem as stated in the title is just to show the degree is 9. So perhaps the assumptions are the irreducibility of x³ - 2 and x³ - 3 over Q, and then the problem is to show that [Q(³√2, ³√3) : Q] = 9. But in the example given, the assumption included the divisibility condition. Wait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So in this case, the assumptions would be the base facts needed, like the irreducibility of the polynomials.\n\nBut the user's problem here is not assuming anything; the question is to show the degree. So perhaps the assumptions are the minimal ones needed, such as:\n\n- Q(³√2) is a degree 3 extension of Q.\n- Q(³√3) is a degree 3 extension of Q.\n- Then the problem is to show that when extending Q(³√2) by ³√3, the degree is also 3, hence total degree 9.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the conditions given. Maybe here, the problem is structured with assumptions that the user starts with. The user in their trial mentions that x³ - 2 is irreducible, so that's an assumption. Then the problem is to show the degree is 9. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\n- The element √[3]{3} is not in Q(√[3]{2}).\n\nProblem:\nShow that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q] = 9.\n\nBut wait, the user's trial also tried to show that √[3]{3} isn't in Q(√[3]{2}), so maybe the assumption is that x³ - 3 has no root in Q(√[3]{2}), hence is irreducible, leading to the degree. But in the problem statement, the user is trying to prove that the degree is 9, which requires showing that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q(√[3]{2})] = 3, which in turn requires that x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q(√[3]{2}).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the irreducibility of x³ - 2 over Q, and the problem is to show the degree is 9. Wait, but the problem in the example included specific assumptions from the original problem. Maybe in this case, the only assumption is that x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q (via Eisenstein), and then the problem is to show that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q] = 9, which requires showing that x³ - 3 remains irreducible over Q(√[3]{2}).\n\nBut the original problem's title is just asking to show the degree is 9, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\nProblem:\nShow that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q] = 9.\n\nBut wait, the irreducibility of x³ - 3 over Q is another assumption. However, the user in their trial mentions that √[3]{3} is algebraic of degree 3 over Q, so that's an assumption. But maybe in the problem's context, these are given (since Eisenstein applies to both polynomials with p=2 and p=3), so they are part of the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's assumptions are just that √[3]{2} and √[3]{3} are algebraic over Q of degree 3 each, and that the problem is to show the compositum has degree 9. But the key is that the extensions are linearly disjoint, which requires that the second extension isn't contained in the first.\n\nTherefore, to structure it properly, the assumptions should list the known conditions:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\n- The field extension Q(√[3]{2}) does not contain √[3]{3}.\n\nProblem:\nShow that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q] = 9.\n\nBut the third assumption is actually what needs to be proven to establish the degree. So maybe the assumptions are only the irreducibility of the polynomials over Q, and the problem is to show the degree, which inherently requires showing that √[3]{3} is not in Q(√[3]{2}).\n\nTherefore, the correct way would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- The polynomial x³ - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n- The polynomial x³ - 3 is irreducible over Q.\n\nProblem:\nShow that [Q(√[3]{2}, √[3]{3}) : Q] = 9.\n\nBecause the problem's core is to show that the degree is 9, given that each individual extension has degree 3. The key step is proving that √[3]{3} isn't in Q(√[3]{2}), hence the degree of the second extension is also 3. Therefore, the problem as structured would have the two irreducibility assumptions, and the problem statement is to compute the total degree.",
