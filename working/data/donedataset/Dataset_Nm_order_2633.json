    "Content": "What I want to ask is the proof of the Proposition 10. in \"Linear Representations of Finite Groups\" by Jean-Pierre Serre. Let $\\rho_i : G \\rightarrow GL(W_i)$ be the distinct irreducible representations of $G$.$(1 \\le i \\le h)$\nWe can extend $\\rho_i$ to $\\widetilde{\\rho_i} : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\text{End}(W_i)$ by $\\widetilde{\\rho_i}(\\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g) = a_g \\sum_{g \\in G} \\rho_i(g)$. Then $\\widetilde{\\rho} = (\\widetilde{\\rho_i}) : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\prod_{i=1}^{h} \\text{End}(W_i) \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})$ is a homomorphism. Then Proposition 10 states that it is an isomorphism. \nSince dimensions of domain and codomain are same, it suffices to show that $\\widetilde{\\rho}$ is surjective. In the proof of the book, If $\\widetilde{\\rho}$ is not surjective, then there exists a nonzero linear form on $\\prod M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})$ vanishing on the image of $\\widetilde{\\rho}$.\nThis gives a nontrivial relation on the coefficients of the representations $\\rho_i$ which is impossible because of the orthogonality formulas of 2.2. But I can not follow the above three lines in the proof. I will appreciate it if you give an explanation for the proof. Thank you.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Given any proper subspace $U\\subset V$ and any $v\\in V$, there exists a linear function $\\phi:V\\to\\Bbb C$ which satisfies $\\phi(u)=0$ for all $u\\in U$ and $\\phi(v)\\ne0$. To see this, pick a basis for $U$, adjoin $v$ to it and extend to a basis for all of $V$, then consider the coordinate projection associated to $v$. Another fact to know: Given a coordinate vector space $V$, any linear map $V\\to\\Bbb C$ is a linear combination of coordinate projection maps. Consider $\\Bbb C[G]\\to\\prod M_{n_i}(\\Bbb C)$. Suppose the image is proper, so there exists a nontrivial linear functional on the latter space which vanishes on the image. As the functional is linear, it must be some linear combination of the coordinates of all of the matrices. Therefore, $$\\sum_{i,j,k} a_{ijk}(\\rho_i(g))_{jk}=0 \\tag{$\\circ$}$$ for all $g\\in G$, where $(\\rho_i(g))_{jk}$ is the $j,k$ matrix coefficient of $\\rho_i(g)$ and $a_{ijk}$ are the coefficients present in the linear functional. But if $(\\circ)$ is true for all $g$, then it is true when $(\\circ)$ is understood as a linear combination of functions $G\\to\\Bbb C$, or in other words the matrix coefficients are linearly dependent functions, since they satisfy the dependence relation $(\\circ)$. But this is impossible. If you're interested in a different proof, I've written one here , which I think is slick, and doesn't make reference to matrix coefficients. (It is an \"abstract nonsense\" proof which leverages representability of the fiber functor, to couch the elementary proof in a deeper language.) It uses Maschke's theorem that complex representations of finite groups are semisimple, and Schur's lemma to compute dimensions of intertwiners. It also explains Schur's orthogonality relations for characters.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help the user by structuring the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question they provided. Let me read through the original question again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe question is about Proposition 10 in Serre's \"Linear Representations of Finite Groups.\" The user is confused about the proof, specifically the part where they need to show that the homomorphism \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is surjective. The key points mentioned are that since the dimensions of the domain and codomain are the same, surjectivity would imply isomorphism. The user is stuck on the argument involving the existence of a nonzero linear form and how orthogonality formulas lead to a contradiction.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from this. The original problem is to prove that \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is an isomorphism. The assumptions are the setup from Serre's book: the existence of distinct irreducible representations \\(\\rho_i\\), their extensions to \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}\\), and the construction of \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) as the product of these extensions. The key steps in the proof involve showing surjectivity by contradiction, using the dimension argument and orthogonality relations.\n\nNow, following the format example given, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nAssumptions would include:\n- \\(G\\) is a finite group.\n- \\(\\rho_i : G \\rightarrow GL(W_i)\\) are the distinct irreducible representations of \\(G\\) for \\(1 \\le i \\le h\\).\n- Each \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}\\) is the extension of \\(\\rho_i\\) to \\(\\mathbb{C}[G]\\) defined by \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}(\\sum a_g g) = \\sum a_g \\rho_i(g)\\).\n- The map \\(\\widetilde{\\rho} = (\\widetilde{\\rho_i}) : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})\\) is a homomorphism.\n- The dimensions of the domain \\(\\mathbb{C}[G]\\) and codomain \\(\\prod M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})\\) are equal.\n\nThe problem is to prove that \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is an isomorphism.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included specific conditions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the assumptions are more about the setup of the representations and the homomorphism. I need to ensure each assumption is a single line, one property per line. Let me structure them properly.\n\nAlso, the original problem in the example had a typo where the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" but in the original problem, it's for every integer n. So the user might have made a mistake there. But in this case, the user is following Serre's proposition, which probably doesn't require any extra conditions beyond the standard setup for finite groups and their representations.\n\nSo, breaking down the assumptions:\n\n- \\(G\\) is a finite group.\n- For each \\(1 \\le i \\le h\\), \\(\\rho_i : G \\rightarrow GL(W_i)\\) is an irreducible representation.\n- The representations \\(\\rho_i\\) are distinct.\n- Each \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}\\) extends \\(\\rho_i\\) to \\(\\mathbb{C}[G]\\) via \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}(\\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g) = \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g \\rho_i(g)\\).\n- The map \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is defined as the product of the \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}\\).\n- The codomain of \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is \\(\\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})\\), where \\(n_i = \\dim(W_i)\\).\n- The dimension of \\(\\mathbb{C}[G]\\) is equal to the dimension of \\(\\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})\\).\n\nThe problem is to prove that \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is an isomorphism.\n\nI need to make sure each assumption is a separate line and addresses one condition. Let me check the original question again. The user mentions that the dimensions are the same, so that's one assumption. The existence of the extensions \\(\\widetilde{\\rho_i}\\) is another. The key is to list all necessary assumptions without missing any critical points from the problem's context.\n\nI think that's covered. Now, structuring the problem part. The user is asking about the proof that the homomorphism is an isomorphism, specifically the surjectivity part. So the problem is to prove that \\(\\widetilde{\\rho}\\) is an isomorphism, which requires showing it's surjective (since injective follows from dimension if surjective, or vice versa depending on the context).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n$G$ is a finite group,\nFor each $1 \\le i \\le h$, $\\rho_i : G \\rightarrow GL(W_i)$ is an irreducible representation,\nThe representations $\\rho_i$ are pairwise distinct,\nEach $\\widetilde{\\rho_i} : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\text{End}(W_i)$ extends $\\rho_i$ by linearity,\n$\\widetilde{\\rho} = (\\widetilde{\\rho_i}) : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\prod_{i=1}^h \\text{End}(W_i)$ is a homomorphism,\n$\\prod_{i=1}^h \\text{End}(W_i) \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})$ where $n_i = \\dim(W_i)$,\nThe dimension of $\\mathbb{C}[G]$ equals the dimension of $\\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\widetilde{\\rho} : \\mathbb{C}[G] \\rightarrow \\prod_{i=1}^h M_{n_i}(\\mathbb{C})$ is an isomorphism.\n\nWait, but the user's question is about the specific step in the proof where surjectivity is shown by contradiction. But according to the example, the problem should be structured as per the original proposition's statement, which in this case is to prove the isomorphism. The user's confusion is about the proof's step, but the formatted problem should present the problem as stated in the proposition. So the problem is to prove that the homomorphism is an isomorphism, with the given assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should capture the proposition's statement, not the user's specific confusion about the proof step. The user is asking for help understanding the proof, but the structured problem is the original proposition they need to prove.",
