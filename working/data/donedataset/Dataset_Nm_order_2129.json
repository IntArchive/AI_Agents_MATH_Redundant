    "Content": "Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a Fréchet space (locally convex, Hausdorff, metrizable, with a family of seminorms $\\{\\|~\\|_n\\}$). I've read that the dual $\\mathcal{F}^*$ is never a Fréchet space, unless $\\mathcal{F}$ is actually a Banach space. I'd like to know in which ways the dual can fail to be Fréchet in general; for example, is it always incomplete as a metric space? Or is it always non-metrizable? What are the real issues here? If there's a relatively easy proof of this fact (that $\\mathcal{F}^*$ is not Fréchet unless $\\mathcal{F}$ is Banach), I would appreciate it as well. Thanks. [EDIT: The reference cited by Dirk contains a Theorem whose proof is inaccessible to me, so I'd upvote/accept an answer that at least sketches such a proof, or provides another way of settling the question. I'd also be interested in any further explanations regarding the statement that \" (...) a LCTVS cannot be a (non-trivial) projective limit and an inductive limit of countably infinite families of Banach spaces at the same time. \", made by Andrew Stacey in that link, which is related to my question.]",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The answer depends a bit on what you mean by \"is a Frechet space\": If you consider $F^*$ just as a vector space there might be complete norms on it which, however, have nothing to do with the duality. If $F$ itself is not normed there is no complete norm $p$ on $F^*$ whose topology is finer than the weak-star-topology:\nSince every continuous linear functional on $F$ is continuous with respect to some $\\|\\cdot\\|_n$ one has $F^*=\\bigcup_n A_n$ where $A_n=\\{f\\in F^*: |F| \\le n\\|\\cdot\\|_n \\}$ is weak-star-compact by Alaoglu's theorem and hence $p$-closed.\nNow, Baire's theorem implies that some $A_N$ has $p$-interior points and the convexity of $A_N$ implies that $0$ is an interior point. This implies\n$F^* = \\bigcup_m m A_N$, that is, every $f\\in F^*$ is continuous with respect\nto the same seminorm $\\| \\cdot\\|_N$. This only holds for normed spaces.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object, and then the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the original question: It's about the dual of a Fréchet space. The user mentions that the dual is never a Fréchet space unless the original space is a Banach space. The question asks about the reasons why the dual fails to be Fréchet—whether it's incomplete, non-metrizable, etc.—and requests a proof sketch or explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The Fréchet space here is defined as locally convex, Hausdorff, metrizable, with a family of seminorms. So each of these properties should be separate assumptions. The problem is to determine in which ways the dual fails to be a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space. Also, the user is asking for a proof sketch or explanation of why the dual isn't Fréchet otherwise.\n\nWait, the original problem statement from the user on Math Stack Exchange includes several parts: why the dual isn't Fréchet (with possible reasons like incompleteness or non-metrizable), and a request for a proof. But according to the example given, the \"Problem\" part should be a concise statement. However, in the example, the assumption included a specific condition (n divisible by 7), but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. Wait, in the example, the user rephrased the problem, maybe correcting an error. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm, that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was a user error. Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it. Or perhaps the user made an error in the example. But perhaps that's not our concern here. We need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current question: The user is asking about the dual of a Fréchet space. The assumptions should list all properties of the Fréchet space: locally convex, Hausdorff, metrizable, with a family of seminorms. Each of these is a separate assumption. Then the problem is that the dual is never a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space, and the problem is to understand why—specifically, asking about the reasons (incompleteness, non-metrizable) and a proof sketch.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be a single statement. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\". Here, the problem is to determine in which ways the dual fails to be Fréchet unless the original is Banach. However, the user also asks for a proof. But the format requires the problem to be structured, and the problem part is just the problem statement. The example included in the formatted problem only the problem statement, even though the original question had multiple parts. So perhaps we need to structure the problem as \"Prove that the dual of a Fréchet space is never a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space, and determine in which ways the dual fails to be Fréchet.\" But maybe the problem part should be the main question, which is the title: \"The dual of a Fréchet space.\" But the user's actual problem is in the question text.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: \"Show that the dual of a Fréchet space is not a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space, and explain the reasons for this failure (e.g., incompleteness, non-metrizability).\"\n\nBut the example given by the user extracted the problem statement and assumptions. Let's look at the example again. Original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7. This suggests that maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show that the formatted problem includes the necessary assumptions. However, in the original problem, maybe there was a missing condition, and the formatted problem corrected it. But perhaps that's not our issue here. Let's proceed.\n\nSo for the current problem: The Fréchet space has properties: locally convex, Hausdorff, metrizable, with family of seminorms. So each of those four properties should be separate assumptions. Then the problem is that its dual is never Fréchet unless the original is Banach, and the user is asking in which ways the dual fails to be Fréchet (e.g., incomplete, non-metrizable) and a proof sketch.\n\nBut according to the format, the problem part should be the main question. So the problem is \"Prove that the dual of a Fréchet space is not a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space, and determine in which ways the dual fails to be Fréchet.\"\n\nBut perhaps the problem part should be the main question, which is the title: \"The dual of a Fréchet space.\" But the user's question is more detailed. Alternatively, the problem is the combination of the title and the question body. However, the format requires the problem to be concise. Let me try to structure it.\n\nAssumptions:\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ is a Fréchet space (locally convex),\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ is Hausdorff,\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ is metrizable,\n- $\\mathcal{F}$ has a family of seminorms $\\{\\|\\cdot\\|_n\\}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that the dual $\\mathcal{F}^*$ is never a Fréchet space unless $\\mathcal{F}$ is a Banach space, and determine the ways in which $\\mathcal{F}^*$ fails to be Fréchet (e.g., incompleteness, non-metrizability).\n\nWait, but the original problem also asks for a proof or explanation of why the dual is not Fréchet unless the original is Banach. So the problem includes two parts: proving the statement and determining the reasons for failure. However, the example given in the user's instruction has a problem statement that is a single directive. Perhaps I need to combine both parts into the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is \"Prove that the dual of a Fréchet space is never a Fréchet space unless the original is a Banach space, and explain the reasons for this failure (such as incompleteness or non-metrizability).\"\n\nI think that's acceptable. Each assumption is a separate line: locally convex, Hausdorff, metrizable, family of seminorms. So four assumptions. Then the problem as stated.",
