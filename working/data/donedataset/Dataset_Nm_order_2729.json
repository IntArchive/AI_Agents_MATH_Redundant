    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format this problem according to their specified structure. Let me first understand the original question.\n\nThe question is: If $a$ commutes with $b$, does $a^{-1}$ commute with $b$? And how can I prove this?\n\nThe example given in the problem shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So I need to break down the given problem into its assumptions and then state the problem.\n\nFirst, the problem involves group elements $a$ and $b$. The main condition is that $a$ commutes with $b$, which means $ab = ba$. The question is whether $a^{-1}$ (the inverse of $a$) also commutes with $b$. \n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n1. $a$ is a group element.\n2. $b$ is a group element.\n3. $a$ commutes with $b$.\n\nEach of these is a separate condition. The problem then is to prove whether $a^{-1}$ commutes with $b$.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumption included that $n$ is an integer and $n$ is divisible by 7. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property. So here, similarly, we have three separate assumptions: a and b are group elements (but each as separate points?), or maybe since they're both group elements, maybe that's one assumption. Wait, the original question states \"$a,b$ are group elements.\" So that's a single condition, but in the example, the user split \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\" into two separate assumptions. So here, maybe we should split \"a is a group element\" and \"b is a group element\" as separate assumptions? But in the original problem statement, it's written as \"$a,b$ are group elements.\" So perhaps in the problem, the user combined both into one. However, according to the example, each assumption should be one property applied to one object. Therefore, to follow the format strictly, perhaps each element being a group element is a separate assumption.\n\nWait, in the example, the first assumption is \"$n$ is an integer,\" which is a single property applied to one object. The second is \"$n$ is divisible by 7,\" again applied to the same object. So in this problem, the original statement is \"$a, b$ are group elements.\" So if I follow the same logic, maybe split into two assumptions: \"a is a group element\" and \"b is a group element.\" Then the third assumption is that \"a commutes with b.\"\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a group element,\nb is a group element,\na commutes with b.\n\nProblem: Prove that a^{-1} commutes with b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem states that a and b are group elements, so that's one assumption. But according to the example, each assumption is a single property on one object. So perhaps split into two.\n\nBut the user's example has two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. So two separate assumptions about n. So here, if a and b are group elements, that's two separate assumptions. Each about one object.\n\nTherefore, the correct breakdown would be:\n\nAssumption:\na is a group element,\nb is a group element,\na commutes with b.\n\nProblem: Prove that a^{-1} commutes with b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So each element's group membership is a separate assumption, and their commutativity is another. Then the problem is to prove that the inverse of a commutes with b.",
