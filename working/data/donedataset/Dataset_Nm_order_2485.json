Attempt Recall the series definition of hypergeometric function $$_2F_1(a,b,c,x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(a)_n(b)_n}{(c)_nn!}x^n,$$ we can transform $I$ into the series form $$I=\\sum_{n,m=0}^\\infty\\frac{(a)_n(a)_m(b)_n(b)_m}{(c)_n(c)_mn!m!(3n+3m+1)}$$ But I can not handle this series. I also thought of using complex method. $$I=\\int_0^1\\bigg[{}_2F_1\\left(\\frac13,\\frac23;1;x\\right)\\bigg]^2\\frac{x^{-2/3}}3dx$$ then let $f(z)=\\bigg[{}_2F_1\\left(\\frac13,\\frac23;1;z\\right)\\bigg]^2(-z)^{-2/3}$ and use keyhole contour, where $(\\cdot)^{-2/3}$ is the principal branch of the multi-valued function. But the nature of the branch of the integrand in the inteval $[1,\\infty)$ is too complex for me to handle. It involves another definite integral which is similar to $I$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Before attacking the integral, I mention something about cubic theta function . The whole solution heavily exploits tools from modular forms. The \"footnote\" contains more information. The three cubic theta functions are defined by $$\\begin{aligned}\na(q) &= \\sum_{m,n} q^{m^2+mn+n^2}\\\\\nb(q) &= \\sum_{m,n} \\zeta_3^{m-n} q^{m^2+mn+n^2}\\\\\nc(q) &= \\sum_{m,n} q^{{(m+\\frac{1}{3})^2+(m+\\frac{1}{3})(n+\\frac{1}{3})+(n+\\frac{1}{3})^2}}\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\zeta_3 = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ , sum is over all $m,n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ . Then it can be shown $^1$ that $$a(q)^3 = b(q)^3+c(q)^3$$ $$a(q) = \\frac{\\eta^3(q) + 9 \\eta^3(q^9)}{\\eta (q^3)}\\qquad b(q) = \\frac{\\eta^3(q)}{\\eta(q^3)}\\qquad c(q) = 3\\frac{\\eta^3(q^3)}{\\eta(q)}$$ where $\\eta(q) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n\\geq 1}(1-q^n)$ is the Dedekind eta function. Define $$K_3(m) = {_2F_1}(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{2}{3};1;m) $$ Similar to elliptic integrals, denote $K_3'(m) = K_3(1-m), m' = 1-m$ . Then one easily shows (I omit the subscript $3$ ): $$\\frac{d}{dm}(\\frac{K'}{K}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\pi}\\frac{1}{mm'K^2}$$ Moreover, letting $q= \\exp(-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\frac{K'(m)}{K(m)})$ , the following inversion formula holds $^2$ when $0<m<1$ : $$a(q) = K(m)\\qquad b(q)=(1-m)^{1/3} K(m)\\qquad c(q) = m^{1/3} K(m)$$ Now we tackle the integral, $$I = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^1 {{m^{ - 2/3}}K{{(m)}^2}dm} $$ we make the substitution $q = \\exp ( - \\frac{{2\\pi }}{{\\sqrt 3 }}\\frac{{K'(m)}}{{K(m)}})$ , the above formulas imply $dq = \\frac{{q}}{{mm'{K^2}}}dm$ , as $m$ increases from $0$ to $1$ , $q$ increases from $0$ to $1$ . $$I = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^1 {\\frac{{b{{(q)}^3}c(q)}}{{mm'{K^2}}}dm}  = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_0^1 {\\frac{{b{{(q)}^3}c(q)}}{q}dq}  = \\int_0^1 {\\frac{{\\eta {{(q)}^8}}}{q}dq} $$ Next, I will use notation $\\eta(q),\\eta(\\tau)$ interchangably (the common notation in context of modular forms), where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$ . \nMake $q=e^{-2\\pi x}$ , then $I$ becomes $$I = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\infty  {\\eta {{(ix)}^8}dx}  = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\infty  {{x^2}\\eta {{(ix)}^8}dx} $$ where in last step, I used $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau} \\eta(\\tau)$ . Transform it back to $q$ : $$\\tag{1} I = \\frac{1}{{4{\\pi ^2}}}\\int_0^1  {\\frac{{{{\\ln }^2}q}}{q}\\eta {{(q)}^8}dq} $$ It can be shown that $^3$ : $$\\eta {(q)^8} =  - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{v \\in S} {({v_0} - {v_1})({v_1} - {v_2})({v_0} - {v_2}){q^{{{\\left\\| v \\right\\|}^2}/6}}}$$ $$S = \\left\\{ {v \\in {\\mathbb{R}^3}|v = ({v_0},{v_1},{v_2}) = (3n,3m + 1,3r - 1),n + m + r = 0,n,m,r\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\right\\}$$ with $\\|v\\|$ the norm of a vector. Plug this into (1): $$I = \\frac{{ - 1}}{{{{(2\\pi )}^2}}}{6^3}\\sum\\limits_{v \\in S} {\\frac{{({v_0} - {v_1})({v_1} - {v_2})({v_0} - {v_2})}}{{{{\\left\\| v \\right\\|}^6}}}} $$ Denote $\\rho = e^{\\pi i/3}$ . Note that $({v_0} - {v_1})({v_1} - {v_2})({v_0} - {v_2}) = 2\\Re {({v_0} + \\rho {v_1})^3}$ and $${\\left\\| v \\right\\|^6} = 8{({v_0} + \\rho {v_1})^3}{({v_0} + {\\rho ^{ - 1}}{v_1})^3}$$ we obtain $$I = \\frac{{ - 27}}{{2{\\pi ^2}}}\\Re \\sum\\limits_{v\\in S} {\\frac{1}{{{{({v_0} + {\\rho ^{ - 1}}{v_1})}^3}}}}  =  - \\frac{{27}}{{2{\\pi ^2}}}\\Re \\sum\\limits_{(m,n) \\in {\\mathbb{Z}^2}} {\\frac{1}{{{{(3n + {\\rho ^{ - 1}}(3m + 1))}^3}}}}$$ The latter can be recognized as an Eisenstein series of level $3$ , but to calculate its value, it is best to use Weierstrass elliptic function. Let $\\wp_{1,\\rho}$ denote this elliptic function with periods $\\{1,\\rho\\}$ , then $${\\wp _{1,\\rho }}'(z) =  - 2\\sum\\limits_{n,m} {\\frac{1}{{{{(z + n + m\\rho )}^3}}}} $$ gives $$I=\\frac{1}{{4{\\pi ^2}}}\\Re \\left[{\\wp _{1,\\rho }}'(\\frac{{{\\rho ^{ - 1}}}}{3})\\right] = \\frac{{{\\omega ^3}}}{{4{\\pi ^2}}}\\Re\\left[ {\\wp _{\\omega ,\\omega \\rho }}'(\\frac{{{\\omega\\rho ^{ - 1}}}}{3})\\right]$$ where $\\omega = \\Gamma(1/3)^3/(2\\pi)$ , then it is well-known that modular invariants associated to periods $\\{\\omega,\\omega\\rho\\}$ are $g_2 = 0, g_3 = 1$ . Therefore ${\\wp _{\\omega ,\\omega \\rho }}'(\\frac{{\\omega {\\rho ^{ - 1}}}}{3})$ is the $y$ -coordinate of a $3$ -torsion of the elliptic curve $y^2 = 4x^3 - g_2 x - g_3 = 4x^3 -1$ , which can be readily calculated to be $\\sqrt{3}$ . Finally we finish the calculation: $I = \\omega^3\\sqrt 3/(4\\pi^2)$ . $^1$ : Proof outline: $a(q^3),b(q^3),c(q^3)$ are modular forms of weight $1$ and level $27$ , therefore it suffices to verify their $q$ -expansions to certain power of $q$ . A self-contained approach can be found in the 1994 paper Cubic Analogues of the Jacobian Theta Function . $^2$ : Proof outline: $f=c^3(\\tau)/a^3(\\tau)$ is modular function of $\\Gamma_0(3)$ , by a fact in modular forms, $b(\\tau)$ satisfies a 2nd order ODE in terms of $f$ , its coefficients are rational functions of $f$ since modular curve $X(3)$ has genus $0$ . Therefore, in certain region of $\\mathbb{H}$ , $b(\\tau) = (1-f)^{1/3} K_3(f)$ , we could replace $\\tau$ by $\\gamma\\tau$ for $\\gamma\\in \\Gamma_0(3)$ , modularity of $b$ allows us to isolate the $\\tau$ . But doing this replacement might change it into another linear independent solution of the ODE, which explains why $K'/K$ arises. The details are more delicate. $^3$ : The exponent $8$ is special here, which is the dimension of semisimple Lie algebra $A_2$ . There is a corresponding formula for $\\eta(q)^d$ each semisimple Lie algebra with dimension $d$ . See Affine Root Systems and Dedekind's eta-Function by I.G. Macdonald.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and the core problem.\n\nLooking at the original question: The integral is from 0 to 1 of the square of the hypergeometric function _2F_1(1/3, 2/3; 1; x³) dx. The goal is to prove that this integral equals a specific gamma function expression. \n\nNow, the assumptions. The integral involves a hypergeometric function with parameters 1/3, 2/3, and 1. The variable inside the hypergeometric function is x³, but the integration variable is x from 0 to 1. The problem states that the integral equals Γ(1/3)^9 * sqrt(3)/(32π^5). The user mentions an integral competition post, which might be an assumption about the problem's origin, but not a mathematical condition. The attempt includes series expansion and contour integration, but those are methods tried, not assumptions.\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are the parameters of the hypergeometric function and the limits of integration. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let's list them:\n\n1. The hypergeometric function is _2F_1 with parameters 1/3, 2/3, 1.\n2. The argument of the hypergeometric function is x³.\n3. The integration is from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nThese are the specific conditions given in the problem.
