    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that for every positive integer n, the number (sqrt(2)+1)^{1/n} + (sqrt(2)-1)^{1/n} is irrational. \n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states \"for every positive integer n\", so the first assumption is that n is a positive integer. Are there any other conditions or properties applied to the objects here? The expression involves sqrt(2)+1 and sqrt(2)-1. These are specific constants; their properties might be relevant, but the problem doesn't state any additional conditions on them except that they are raised to the power 1/n. Since the problem is about proving irrationality, perhaps the key assumptions are just about n being a positive integer. The problem doesn't mention any divisibility conditions on n like in the example, so I don't need to include those.\n\nWait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption here that sqrt(2)+1 and sqrt(2)-1 are positive real numbers, which they are since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so sqrt(2)+1 is about 2.414 and sqrt(2)-1 is about 0.414, both positive. But since they are raised to the 1/n, which is a real positive root, that's valid. However, the user probably doesn't need to state these as assumptions because they are inherent to the problem's construction. The problem is in the context of real numbers, so those roots exist and are positive. Therefore, the main explicit assumption is that n is a positive integer. \n\nSo the assumptions should be: n is a positive integer. The problem is to show the sum is irrational. Let me check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Here, there's no additional condition like divisibility, so only one assumption. \n\nTherefore, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$(\\sqrt{2}+1)^{1/n} + (\\sqrt{2}-1)^{1/n}$$ is irrational.\n\nWait, but the original title and question mention \"for every positive integer n\", so that's the only assumption. I don't see any other conditions. Let me double-check. The problem states \"for every positive integer n\", so yes, n is a positive integer. The expression is built from that. So the assumptions part only has that one line. The problem then is to prove the sum is irrational. That seems to fit the format.",
