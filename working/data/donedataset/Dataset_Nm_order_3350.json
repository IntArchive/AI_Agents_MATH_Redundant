    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is to prove that the sum of the arctangent of 1, arctangent of 2, and arctangent of 3 equals pi. \n\nFirst, I remember that the arctangent function gives an angle whose tangent is the given number. So, arctan(1) is π/4 because tan(π/4) = 1. Then, we need to add arctan(2) and arctan(3) to that. The challenge here is to show that when you add these three angles together, you get π radians.\n\nI recall that there's a formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles: tan(a + b) = (tan a + tan b)/(1 - tan a tan b). Maybe I can use this formula to combine the arctangent terms step by step. Let's start by adding arctan(1) and arctan(2), then see if adding arctan(3) gets us to pi.\n\nLet’s denote α = arctan(1) = π/4, β = arctan(2), and γ = arctan(3). So we need to show α + β + γ = π.\n\nStarting with α + β. Using the tangent addition formula:\n\ntan(α + β) = (tan α + tan β)/(1 - tan α tan β) = (1 + 2)/(1 - 1*2) = 3/(1 - 2) = 3/(-1) = -3.\n\nSo tan(α + β) = -3. That means α + β = arctan(-3) + kπ for some integer k. However, since arctan returns values between -π/2 and π/2, but α and β are both positive, their sum should be between 0 and 3π/4 (since arctan(2) is less than π/2). Wait, but arctan(-3) is negative, which doesn't align. Maybe I should consider the principal value here. Alternatively, maybe α + β is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative. Because the sum of two positive angles, each less than π/2, but their sum could be more than π/2. Since tan(α + β) is -3, which is negative, that would mean that α + β is in the second quadrant. So, arctan(-3) is equivalent to π - arctan(3). Therefore, α + β = π - arctan(3). \n\nBut wait, if α + β = π - arctan(3), then adding γ = arctan(3) to that would give π - arctan(3) + arctan(3) = π. That seems to work! Let me verify this again.\n\nSo, tan(α + β) = -3. Since α + β is in the second quadrant (because tan is negative there), then α + β = π - arctan(3). Therefore, when we add γ = arctan(3), we get α + β + γ = π - arctan(3) + arctan(3) = π. Therefore, the total sum is pi. \n\nBut let me check this step by step again to make sure. Let me compute α + β + γ.\n\nFirst, compute α + β:\n\nα = arctan(1) = π/4.\n\nβ = arctan(2). Let's compute the sum π/4 + arctan(2). As we did before, using tan(π/4 + arctan(2)):\n\ntan(π/4 + arctan(2)) = [tan(π/4) + tan(arctan(2))]/[1 - tan(π/4) tan(arctan(2))] = (1 + 2)/(1 - 1*2) = 3/(-1) = -3.\n\nSo the tangent is -3, so the angle is in the second quadrant, as π/4 + arctan(2) must be between π/4 + 0 and π/4 + π/2 = 3π/4. But since the tangent is negative, the angle is actually in the second quadrant between π/2 and 3π/4. Therefore, π/4 + arctan(2) = π - arctan(3). Wait, how do we know it's arctan(3)? Let me see.\n\nSuppose θ = π - arctan(3). Then tan(θ) = tan(π - arctan(3)) = -tan(arctan(3)) = -3. Which matches the tangent of α + β. Therefore, θ = π - arctan(3). Therefore, α + β = π - arctan(3). Then adding γ = arctan(3) gives π.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is π. That seems to check out. Therefore, the original equation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to compute the sum of all three arctans and take the tangent of both sides. Let's compute tan(arctan(1) + arctan(2) + arctan(3)) and see if it's tan(pi) = 0.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Let's try.\n\nFirst, compute tan(arctan(1) + arctan(2) + arctan(3)).\n\nLet me denote A = arctan(1), B = arctan(2), C = arctan(3). Then, we need tan(A + B + C).\n\nWe can use the formula tan(A + B + C) = [tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C]/[1 - tan A tan B - tan A tan C - tan B tan C].\n\nPlugging in tan A = 1, tan B = 2, tan C = 3.\n\nNumerator: 1 + 2 + 3 - (1)(2)(3) = 6 - 6 = 0.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (1*2 + 1*3 + 2*3) = 1 - (2 + 3 + 6) = 1 - 11 = -10.\n\nSo tan(A + B + C) = 0 / (-10) = 0.\n\nSince the tangent of the sum is 0, which occurs at integer multiples of pi. However, since each arctan term is positive and each is less than pi/2, but their sum is pi, which is the principal value where tan is zero. So indeed, the sum is pi.\n\nTherefore, this confirms that arctan(1) + arctan(2) + arctan(3) = pi.\n\nSo the key steps are using the tangent addition formula and recognizing that the sum of the three arctangent terms results in an angle whose tangent is zero, which is pi. The intermediate steps involve combining two angles first and then adding the third, using the properties of tangent in different quadrants.",
