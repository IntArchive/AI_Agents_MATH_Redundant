    "AcceptedAnswer": "Find a function whose Fourier coefficients are $\\sin{k}/k$.  Then evaluate the integral of the square of that function.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The question is about proving the identity that π equals the sum from k = -∞ to ∞ of (sin(k)/k) squared. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states an identity involving π and an infinite series. The original question doesn't mention any specific conditions or restrictions, so I need to check if there are implicit assumptions. The sum is over all integers k, including zero. Wait, but when k=0, sin(k)/k becomes 0/0, which is undefined. So maybe there's an implicit assumption that the term at k=0 is handled, perhaps by taking the limit as k approaches 0. In the original problem, the user wrote the sum as starting from -∞ to ∞, which includes k=0. However, in such series, sometimes the k=0 term is treated separately. Let me verify: sin(k)/k as k approaches 0 is 1, so maybe they take the limit and define the term at k=0 as 1. So the assumption here would be that when k=0, the term is interpreted as the limit, making it 1.\n\nAdditionally, the problem might assume that the reader is familiar with Fourier series or Poisson summation formulas, but since the user hasn't specified any methods, I shouldn't include those as assumptions. The key assumptions are about the terms of the series and the convergence. But according to the format, each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So the main assumptions here are related to the terms in the summation, particularly handling the k=0 case.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the original problem is in the context of mathematical proof, so maybe there's an assumption that the series converges. However, the problem as stated just asks to prove the identity, so perhaps convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, it's not an assumption but part of the problem itself. \n\nSo the primary assumption is about the treatment of the k=0 term in the summation. Without that, the expression would be undefined. Therefore, the assumption is that the term at k=0 is defined as 1 (the limit as k approaches 0 of sin(k)/k). The problem then is to show that the sum of (sin(k)/k)^2 over all integers k equals π, with the understanding that the k=0 term is 1.\n\nSo, structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- For k = 0, the term (sin(k)/k)² is defined as 1 (the limit as k approaches 0).\n\nProblem:\nProve that π equals the sum from k = -∞ to ∞ of (sin(k)/k)².\n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is one line, addressing one property. Here, the key assumption is the definition at k=0. The problem statement is straightforward.",
