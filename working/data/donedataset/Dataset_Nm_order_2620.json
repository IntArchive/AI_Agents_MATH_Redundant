    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $deg(P)=n>0$ and assume without loss of generality that $deg(Q) \\leq deg(P)$. Consider the polynomial $R=(P-Q)P'$ ($P'$ denote the derivative of $P$). We have :\n$$deg(R)\\leq 2n-1 $$ Now if $r$ is a root of multiplicity $k$ of $P$ then $r$ is a root of $P'$ of multiplicity $k-1$ and because $Q(r)=0$, $r$ is a root of $P-Q$. hence $r$ is a root of $R$ of multiplicity at least $k$. So the n zeros of $P$ produces at least $n$ zeros of $R$, when multiplicities are counted. The same pattern can be applied to $P-1$, every root $r$ of multiplicity $k$ of $P-1$ is a root of $P-Q$ and a root of multiplicity $k-1$ of $(P-1)'=P'$. So the n zeros of $P-1$ produces at least another $n$ zeros of $R$ when multiplicities are counted.\n(the zeros of $P$ are all different with the zeros of $P-1$ it's obvious). This means that $R$ has at least $2n$ roots and beacuse $deg(R)\\leq 2n-1 $ we conclude that $R=0$ which implies $P=Q$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the question is about two polynomials P(x) and Q(x) with complex coefficients, both of degree at least 1. The conditions given are that P(z) = 0 if and only if Q(z) = 0, and similarly P(z) = 1 if and only if Q(z) = 1. We need to prove that P(x) equals Q(x) for all complex x.\n\nFirst, let me parse the assumptions. The first condition says that the roots of P and Q are the same. Because if P(z) = 0 exactly when Q(z) = 0, that means they have the same set of zeros, counting multiplicities? Wait, the problem doesn't mention multiplicities, so maybe only that the sets of roots are the same, but perhaps with different multiplicities? Hmm, but maybe that's something we need to consider.\n\nSimilarly, the second condition is about P(z) = 1 if and only if Q(z) = 1. So, the solutions to P(z) = 1 are exactly the same as the solutions to Q(z) = 1. So, the equations P(z) - 1 = 0 and Q(z) - 1 = 0 have the same roots. So, again, same roots for both polynomials P(z) - 1 and Q(z) - 1.\n\nNow, the user mentions that they know P and Q share the same roots, but the problem is to show that P = Q. So, even if they share roots, they could differ by a constant multiple, but here maybe the additional condition on P(z) = 1 will force that constant multiple to be 1.\n\nWait, but if P and Q have the same roots (including multiplicities?), then they differ by a constant factor. So if P(z) = c Q(z) for some constant c. Then, if that's the case, then substituting into the equation P(z) = 1 would give c Q(z) = 1. But Q(z) = 1/c. But if Q(z) = 1 implies P(z) = 1, then substituting, we have c * (1/c) = 1, which holds. But also, if Q(z) = 1/c, then P(z) = 1. So unless c = 1, this might not hold. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose P(z) = c Q(z). Then, the roots of P(z) are the same as those of Q(z) only if c ≠ 0, which is given since polynomials are non-zero (degree ≥1). Then, the roots are the same, so multiplicities as well. So, P(z) = c Q(z). Then, for the equation P(z) = 1, that would be c Q(z) = 1. So, Q(z) = 1/c. Similarly, Q(z) =1 implies P(z) =1, which would mean c *1 =1, so c=1. Therefore, c must be 1. Therefore, P=Q.\n\nBut wait, this is assuming that P and Q are scalar multiples of each other. But in the problem, the user says \"share the same roots\" but not necessarily with the same multiplicities. Wait, actually, the problem states \"P(z) =0 iff Q(z)=0\", which would mean that the sets of roots are the same, but multiplicities could differ. Wait, if multiplicities differ, then P and Q wouldn't be scalar multiples. For example, P(z) = z and Q(z) = z^2. Then, P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0 (both only at z=0), but P(z) is degree 1, Q(z) is degree 2. But in the problem, the degrees are at least 1, but not necessarily the same. But here, P and Q are supposed to have the same roots, but maybe different multiplicities, but the problem states \"if and only if\", which is about existence, not multiplicity. So, perhaps they have the same roots with possibly different multiplicities. Similarly for the equations P(z)=1 and Q(z)=1.\n\nBut then, how can we use both conditions to conclude that P=Q?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the polynomial P(z) - Q(z). If we can show that this polynomial has infinitely many roots, then it must be the zero polynomial, hence P=Q.\n\nBut how? Let's think. Suppose that z is a root of P(z) - Q(z). Then, P(z) = Q(z). But the problem gives conditions when P(z) is 0 or 1. So, if P(z) = Q(z), then whenever P(z) is 0 or 1, Q(z) is also 0 or 1. But maybe the problem's conditions imply that P(z) and Q(z) agree on infinitely many points, hence must be equal.\n\nWait, but how? Let's see. The roots of P and Q are the same. Let’s call these roots {a1, a2, ..., an} (counted without multiplicity). Then, the roots of P(z) -1 and Q(z) -1 are the same. Let's denote those as {b1, b2, ..., bm} (again, possibly different multiplicities).\n\nIf we can show that P and Q agree on these roots and the roots of P(z)-1 and Q(z)-1, then maybe they agree on enough points to force them to be the same polynomial.\n\nBut complex polynomials are determined uniquely by their coefficients, but if two polynomials agree on infinitely many points, they must be the same. So, if we can show that P(z) = Q(z) for infinitely many z, then they are equal.\n\nBut how does the given condition lead to infinitely many agreements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that P and Q share the same values at the roots of (P(z) - Q(z)). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the set of z where P(z) = 0 or 1 is the same as where Q(z) =0 or1. But outside of these points, does P(z) equal Q(z)? Maybe not necessarily. But perhaps considering the function P(z) - Q(z) has zeros only at the points where P(z) = Q(z). But if P(z) - Q(z) had infinitely many zeros, then it would be identically zero. But how do we know that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the equation P(z) - Q(z) =0. If this equation has infinitely many solutions, then P=Q. So, if we can show that there are infinitely many z where P(z)=Q(z), then done.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, consider that P and Q are polynomials such that they have the same zeros and the same ones (i.e., P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1). So, suppose that S is the set of all z where P(z)=0 or P(z)=1. Similarly for Q(z). Then, S is the same for both. But outside of S, can P and Q differ? If so, then maybe not. But perhaps the fact that they have these overlapping conditions forces them to agree elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the polynomial P(Q(z)) and Q(P(z)). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function f(z) = P(z) - Q(z). If f(z) is not identically zero, then it's a non-zero polynomial, hence has finitely many roots. So, if we can show that f(z) has infinitely many roots, then f must be zero. So, how?\n\nSuppose that for all z where P(z) =0 or 1, Q(z)=0 or 1 respectively. But these are specific values. However, maybe the equations P(z)=Q(z) can be derived from these conditions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if P(z) and Q(z) share the same zeros and same ones, then perhaps they are equal. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of P and Q as functions. Suppose two polynomials P and Q have the property that their fibers over 0 and 1 are the same. That is, P^{-1}(0) = Q^{-1}(0) and P^{-1}(1) = Q^{-1}(1). Then, can we conclude that P=Q?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem where if two functions agree on preimages of two points, under certain conditions, they must be equal.\n\nIn complex analysis, if two non-constant entire functions share two finite sets as preimages, then they must be equal. But polynomials are entire functions.\n\nBut perhaps we can use the fact that if two polynomials have the same preimages for two distinct values, then they must coincide. But I need to recall if this is a known theorem.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if P and Q are polynomials such that P(z) =0 ⇨ Q(z)=0 and vice versa, so they have the same roots. Similarly, P(z)=1 ⇨ Q(z)=1 and vice versa. So, their fibers over 0 and 1 are the same.\n\nNow, suppose we take the polynomial P(z) - Q(z). If this polynomial is not identically zero, then it has finite degree, so finitely many roots. However, suppose that for every root a of P, since P(a)=0, then Q(a)=0, so P(a)-Q(a)=0. Similarly, for every root b of P(z)=1, P(b)-Q(b)=0. So, all the roots of P(z)=0 and P(z)=1 are roots of P(z)-Q(z). If there are infinitely many such roots, then P(z)-Q(z) must be identically zero.\n\nBut wait, the roots of P(z)=0 and P(z)=1 are finite in number unless P is a constant function. But since P and Q have degree at least 1, they are non-constant. Therefore, the set of roots of P(z)=0 and P(z)=1 is finite. Therefore, P(z)-Q(z) can only have finitely many roots, unless P=Q.\n\nBut how does this help? Since P(z)-Q(z) is a polynomial, if it's not the zero polynomial, it can only have finitely many roots. But if the problem's conditions imply that P(z)-Q(z) has infinitely many roots, then it must be zero. But if the conditions only give finitely many roots (the roots of P(z)=0 and P(z)=1), then that's not enough.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given that P and Q have degree at least 1. So, if P and Q are different, then P-Q is a non-zero polynomial of some degree. But if we can show that P-Q has infinitely many zeros, which would force it to be zero.\n\nBut how? If we can find infinitely many z where P(z)=Q(z), then done. But how to find such z?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that P and Q have the same value at infinitely many points. For example, consider that the equations P(z) = Q(z) could have infinitely many solutions if P=Q. Otherwise, if P≠Q, then it's a non-zero polynomial, so only finitely many solutions. But the problem's conditions don't directly give us that P(z)=Q(z) except at the roots of P(z)=0 or 1, which are finite. So, this approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Suppose that P and Q share the same roots (with multiplicities?) and the same points where they equal 1 (with multiplicities?). Then, perhaps P and Q can be related in some way.\n\nLet me think multiplicatively. Suppose that P(z) = c * Q(z). Then, as before, c must be 1 because of the P(z)=1 condition. But this only works if P and Q are scalar multiples. But maybe they aren't. For example, P(z) = z and Q(z) = z + 0. Then they are the same. But if Q(z) is a different polynomial with same roots and same 1-points, perhaps they must coincide.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if P and Q have the same zeros, then P(z) = Q(z) * e^{g(z)}, but since they are polynomials, e^{g(z)} must be a polynomial, so a constant. Wait, that's from complex analysis, but for polynomials, if two polynomials have the same zeros (with multiplicities), then they differ by a constant. So, if P and Q have the same zeros with the same multiplicities, then P = c Q. Then, using the condition on P(z)=1, we have c Q(z) =1 iff Q(z)=1. So, if Q(z)=1, then c=1. Therefore, c=1, so P=Q.\n\nBut the problem states \"P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0\", which doesn't specify multiplicities. So, if they have the same roots but different multiplicities, then P and Q would not be scalar multiples. For example, P(z)=z and Q(z)=z^2. Then P(z)=0 iff z=0, and Q(z)=0 iff z=0, so same roots. But P and Q are not scalar multiples. However, in this case, the condition on P(z)=1 would require that Q(z)=1 iff P(z)=1. Let's check: P(z)=1 implies z=1, then Q(z)=1 implies z^2=1, so z=1 or z=-1. But P(z)=1 only at z=1, which is not the same as Q(z)=1. So, in this case, the conditions of the problem are not met. Therefore, if P(z)=z and Q(z)=z^2, they don't satisfy the problem's conditions because Q(z)=1 has more roots than P(z)=1. Therefore, such a pair wouldn't be allowed in the problem's assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the problem's conditions (P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1) prevent the multiplicities from being different. Because if P and Q have the same roots but different multiplicities, then when we set P(z)=1, maybe the solutions differ. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, let's take P(z) = z and Q(z) = z^2. As before, P(z)=0 iff z=0, Q(z)=0 iff z=0, so same roots. But P(z)=1 has solution z=1, while Q(z)=1 has solutions z=1 and z=-1. Therefore, P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1 is not satisfied, since Q(z)=1 has an extra solution at z=-1. Therefore, such polynomials wouldn't satisfy the problem's conditions. Hence, the problem's conditions must force that the multiplicities are the same.\n\nTherefore, if two polynomials have the same roots (with multiplicities) and the same 1-points (with multiplicities), then they must be the same polynomial. But how do we formalize this?\n\nSuppose that P(z) and Q(z) share the same roots with the same multiplicities and same 1-points with the same multiplicities. Then, we can write P(z) = c(z - a1)^{m1}...(z - an)^{mn} and Q(z) = d(z - a1)^{m1}...(z - an)^{mn}. Then, if they also agree on the 1-points, then c must equal d. Because suppose z0 is a root of P(z) -1, then Q(z0) =1. But Q(z0) = d(z0 - a1)^{m1}... which equals 1. Similarly, P(z0) = c(z0 - a1)^{m1}... =1. Therefore, c/d =1, so c=d. Therefore, P=Q.\n\nBut in the problem, it's not stated that the multiplicities are the same. The problem says \"P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0\", which is about the existence of roots, not their multiplicities. Similarly for \"P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1\". So, does the problem require that the multiplicities are the same? If not, then the previous example with P(z)=z and Q(z)=z^2 shows that they would not satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the problem's conditions implicitly require that multiplicities are the same for roots and for 1-points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that if two polynomials have the same zeros and the same 1-points (counted with multiplicity), then they must be equal. Therefore, perhaps the given conditions actually force the multiplicities to be the same.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following approach: Since P and Q share the same zeros, we can write P(z) = A(z) * R(z) and Q(z) = B(z) * R(z), where R(z) is the greatest common divisor of P and Q. But then, since they have the same zeros, R(z) would include all the linear factors, but maybe A(z) and B(z) are coprime? Wait, not necessarily. Alternatively, since they share the same roots, then they can be written as P(z) = R(z) and Q(z) = S(z), where R and S have the same roots. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the rational function P(z)/Q(z). If P and Q share the same roots, then this function is a rational function with no zeros or poles (since the zeros cancel out). Therefore, P(z)/Q(z) is a constant. Therefore, P(z) = c Q(z). Then, applying the condition P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1 gives that c Q(z) =1 iff Q(z)=1. So, if Q(z)=1, then c=1. Therefore, c=1, hence P=Q.\n\nAh, this seems like a good approach. Let's formalize it:\n\nSince P and Q have the same zeros (with multiplicity?), then P(z) = c Q(z) for some constant c. Then, from the condition that P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1, substituting gives c Q(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1. Therefore, if Q(z)=1, then c=1, hence c=1, so P(z)=Q(z). Therefore, they are the same polynomial.\n\nBut wait, does the fact that they have the same zeros (with multiplicity) imply that they are scalar multiples? Yes. Because if two polynomials have exactly the same roots with the same multiplicities, then they differ by a constant factor. For example, if P(z) = k (z - a1)^{m1}...(z - an)^{mn} and Q(z) = l (z - a1)^{m1}...(z - an)^{mn}, then P(z) = (k/l) Q(z). So, they are scalar multiples.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0\", which is equivalent to saying that they have the same set of roots, but not necessarily the same multiplicities. So, if they have the same roots but different multiplicities, then they are not scalar multiples. Therefore, the previous argument only holds if the multiplicities are the same.\n\nBut how does the problem's condition on P(z)=1 and Q(z)=1 enforce that the multiplicities are the same?\n\nFor example, suppose P(z) = z and Q(z) = z^2. They share the same root at z=0, but with different multiplicities. However, as before, P(z)=1 has solution z=1, Q(z)=1 has solutions z=1 and z=-1. So, the problem's conditions aren't met. Therefore, the problem's conditions (P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1) must imply that the multiplicities are the same for the roots and for the 1-points.\n\nTherefore, if two polynomials have the same roots (with multiplicities) and same 1-points (with multiplicities), then they must be scalar multiples. Then, using the 1-point condition, the scalar multiple must be 1.\n\nBut how do we formally show that the multiplicities must be the same?\n\nAlternatively, consider that if P and Q share the same roots (not necessarily multiplicities), then P(z)/Q(z) is a rational function with no zeros or poles (since they have the same zeros and same poles at infinity). Wait, but P and Q are polynomials, so their only poles are at infinity. The ratio P(z)/Q(z) is a rational function which is entire (no poles in the finite plane) if Q(z) divides P(z) or vice versa. But in general, if they have the same zeros, then P(z) = R(z) * product(z - ai)^{mi} and Q(z) = S(z) * product(z - ai)^{ni}, where R and S are polynomials without roots at ai. But the problem states that P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0, which would mean that the sets {ai} are the same for both P and Q. However, if the multiplicities mi and ni are different, then P(z)/Q(z) would have factors of (z - ai)^{mi - ni}. If mi ≠ ni for some i, then this rational function would have either zeros or poles at those points, which contradicts that P(z)/Q(z) is a constant.\n\nWait, but in the problem, since P and Q are polynomials with the same roots (but possibly different multiplicities), the ratio P(z)/Q(z) would be a rational function, but since both are polynomials, it's a polynomial divided by a polynomial, i.e., a rational function. However, if they have the same zeros, then the ratio would be a polynomial with no zeros, hence a constant. Wait, that's not necessarily true. For example, P(z) = z^2 and Q(z) = z. Then, P(z)/Q(z) = z, which is a polynomial, not a constant. But in this case, P(z)=0 iff Q(z)=0 (both at z=0), but the ratio is not a constant.\n\nBut in this case, the problem's second condition (P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1) is not satisfied. For P(z)=z^2, Q(z)=z. Then, P(z)=1 implies z^2=1, so z=1 or z=-1. Q(z)=1 implies z=1. Therefore, P(z)=1 has more solutions than Q(z)=1, so they don't satisfy the problem's conditions. Therefore, the problem's conditions must force the multiplicities to be the same.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the key is that the conditions on P(z)=1 and Q(z)=1 force the multiplicities of the roots to be the same. How?\n\nSuppose that P and Q share the same roots but with different multiplicities. Then, their ratio is a non-constant polynomial. For example, P(z) = z^2 and Q(z) = z. Then, P(z)/Q(z) = z. Now, consider the equation P(z) =1. For P(z)=z^2=1, solutions are z=1 and z=-1. For Q(z)=z=1, solution is z=1. Therefore, the extra solution z=-1 in P(z)=1 is not present in Q(z)=1, violating the problem's condition. Therefore, this case is excluded by the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, if two polynomials P and Q have the same roots (possibly different multiplicities) and same 1-points (possibly different multiplicities), then their ratio must be a constant. Otherwise, the ratio would be a non-constant polynomial, leading to discrepancies in the solutions of P(z)=1 and Q(z)=1.\n\nTherefore, to formalize:\n\n1. Since P and Q have the same roots (with multiplicities forced by the second condition), then P(z) = c Q(z).\n\n2. Then, using the condition that P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1, we substitute to get c Q(z) =1 iff Q(z)=1. Therefore, when Q(z)=1, c must be 1. Hence, c=1, so P=Q.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that P=Q.\n\nBut to make this rigorous, we need to show that P and Q must be scalar multiples. To do that, we need to ensure that the multiplicities of their zeros are the same, which is enforced by the problem's conditions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that if two polynomials P and Q have the same zeros (without assuming multiplicities), then P(z)/Q(z) is a rational function with no zeros or poles in the finite complex plane except possibly at infinity. But since both are polynomials, the ratio is a polynomial if Q divides P or vice versa, but in general, it's a rational function.\n\nHowever, if P(z)/Q(z) is a polynomial, say S(z), then Q(z) * S(z) = P(z). Similarly, if Q(z)/P(z) is a polynomial, then P(z) divides Q(z). But unless S(z) is a constant, this would introduce additional roots.\n\nBut given the problem's conditions, if S(z) is a non-constant polynomial, then P(z) = S(z) Q(z). Then, considering the equation P(z) =1, which is S(z) Q(z) =1. But Q(z)=1 implies P(z) = S(z). Therefore, if Q(z)=1, then S(z) must equal 1. Therefore, S(z)=1 whenever Q(z)=1. But if S(z) is a non-constant polynomial, then the equation S(z)=1 has only finitely many solutions, unless S(z) is identically 1. Therefore, unless S(z)≡1, there are only finitely many z where S(z)=1. But Q(z)=1 has infinitely many solutions? No, Q(z)=1 is a polynomial equation of degree ≥1, so it has finitely many solutions (specifically, equal to the degree of Q). Wait, but if Q(z) is a polynomial of degree n≥1, then Q(z)=1 has exactly n solutions (counting multiplicities) in the complex plane. Similarly, P(z)=1 has exactly m solutions, where m is the degree of P. But since P(z) = S(z) Q(z), the degree of P is deg(S) + deg(Q). So, if deg(S) ≥1, then deg(P) > deg(Q). But the problem states that both P and Q have degrees ≥1, but not necessarily the same.\n\nHowever, the problem's condition requires that the solutions to P(z)=1 and Q(z)=1 are the same. So, if P(z)=1 has deg(P) solutions and Q(z)=1 has deg(Q) solutions, then unless deg(P) = deg(Q), the number of solutions would differ. But in the problem, the solution sets are the same, so their multiplicities must also be the same. Therefore, deg(P) = deg(Q), and hence, if P(z) = S(z) Q(z), then deg(S) =0, so S is a constant. Therefore, S(z)=c, a constant. Therefore, P(z) = c Q(z). Then, as before, using P(z)=1 iff Q(z)=1, we get c=1.\n\nTherefore, this shows that P=Q.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSince P and Q have the same zeros, we can write P=cQ. Since they also have the same 1-points, substituting gives c=1. Hence, P=Q.\n\nTherefore, the key steps are:\n\n1. Show that P and Q must be scalar multiples because they share the same zeros.\n\n2. Show that the scalar multiple must be 1 because they share the same 1-points.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions that P and Q share zeros and ones as specified, leading to the conclusion they are equal.",
