    "Content": "How to prove that $\\quad\\displaystyle\\frac{4^{n}}{\\sqrt{4n}}<\\binom{2n}{n}<\\frac{4^{n}}{\\sqrt{3n+1}}\\quad$ for all $n$ > 1 ? Does anyone know any better elementary estimates? Attempt. We have $$\\frac1{2^n}\\binom{2n}{n}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{2n-k}{2(n-k)}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2(n-k)}\\right).$$ Then we have $$\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2(n-k)}\\right)>\\sqrt{1+\\frac{k}{n-k}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{n-k}}.$$ So maybe, for the lower bound, we have $$\\frac{n^{\\frac{n}{2}}}{\\sqrt{n!}}=\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{n-k}}>\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{4n}}.$$ By Stirling, $n!\\approx \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n$ , so the lhs becomes $$\\frac{e^{\\frac{n}{2}}}{(2\\pi n)^{\\frac14}},$$ but this isn't $>\\frac{2^n}{\\sqrt{4n}}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here are some crude bounds: $${1\\over 2\\sqrt{n}}\\leq {2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}}\\leq{3\\over4\\sqrt{n+1}},\\quad n\\geq1.$$ We begin with the product representations\n$${2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}}={1\\over 2n}\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1+{1\\over 2j}\\right)=\\prod_{j=1}^n\\left(1-{1\\over2j}\\right),\\quad n\\geq1.$$ From\n$$ \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1+{1\\over 2j}\\right)^{\\!\\!2}=\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1+{1\\over j}+{1\\over 4j^2}\\right)\\geq \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1+{1\\over j}\\right)=n,$$\nwe see that\n$$\\left({2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}} \\right)^{2} = {1\\over (2n)^2}\\, \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1+{1\\over 2j}\\right)^{\\!\\!2}\n\\geq {1\\over 4n^2}\\, n ={1\\over 4n},\\quad n\\geq1.$$\n so by taking square roots, ${2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}}\\geq \\displaystyle{1\\over 2\\sqrt{n}}.$ On the other hand, $$ \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1+{1\\over 2j}\\right)  \\left(1-{1\\over 2j}\\right)\n= \\prod_{j=1}^{n}\\left(1-{1\\over 4j^2}\\right)\\leq {3\\over 4},$$\nso that (using the lower bound above), we have\n$$ {2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}}=\\prod_{j=1}^n\\left(1-{1\\over2j}\\right)\\leq{3\\over4\\sqrt{n+1}}.$$ Alternatively, multiplying the different representations we get\n $$n\\left[{2n\\choose n}{1\\over 2^{2n}}\\right]^2={1\\over 2}\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\left(1-{1\\over4j^2}\\right) \\,\\left(1-{1\\over 2n}\\right).$$\nIt's not hard to show that the right hand side increases from $1/4$ to $1/\\pi$ for $n\\geq 1$. Edit: You can get better bounds if you know Wallis's formula: $$2n\\left[{2n\\choose n}{1\\over 4^n}\\right]^2={1\\over 2}{3\\over 2}{3\\over 4}{5\\over 4}\\cdots\n{2n-1\\over 2n-2}{2n-1\\over 2n}={1\\over 2}\\prod_{j=2}^n\\left(1+{1\\over 4j(j-1)}\\right)$$ $$(2n+1)\\left[{2n\\choose n}{1\\over 4^n}\\right]^2={1\\over 2}{3\\over 2}{3\\over 4}{5\\over 4}\\cdots\n{2n-1\\over 2n-2}{2n-1\\over 2n}{2n+1\\over 2n}=\\prod_{j=1}^n\\left(1-{1\\over 4j^2}\\right)$$ By Wallis's formula, both middle expressions converge to ${2\\over \\pi}$.\nThe right hand side of the first equation is increasing, while the right hand\nside of the second equation is decreasing. We conclude that $${1\\over\\sqrt{\\pi(n+1/2)}}\\leq {2n\\choose n}{1\\over 4^n}\\leq {1\\over\\sqrt{\\pi n}}.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving inequalities for the central binomial coefficient. The user wants the assumptions and the problem statement separated. \n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The problem states \"for all n > 1\", so that's one assumption. The problem is to prove the inequality involving the binomial coefficient. The user also mentions \"elementary estimates\" and provided an attempt with product expansions and Stirling's approximation, but maybe those are part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nThe original problem doesn't mention any specific conditions on n beyond being greater than 1. So the main assumption is that n is an integer greater than 1. There's no other conditions applied here. The problem is just to prove that 4^n / sqrt(4n) is less than the binomial coefficient (2n choose n), which is less than 4^n / sqrt(3n +1). \n\nWait, the example given in the user's instruction had an assumption where n is divisible by 7, but that was specific to that problem. Here, the only assumption is n >1 and n is an integer. The problem is to prove those inequalities. So I should list the assumptions as n being an integer greater than 1. Since each assumption is one line, perhaps split into two: n is an integer, n >1. But according to the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So here, same logic: n is an integer, n >1. \n\nThe problem statement is to prove the inequality. The user also asks if there are better elementary estimates, but that's part of the original question. However, the task is to structure the problem, not the additional questions. So the main problem is to prove the given inequalities. \n\nSo putting it all together, the assumptions are n is an integer and n >1, each on separate lines. The problem is the inequality chain. I need to make sure the LaTeX is correctly formatted as in the example. The user's example used $$...$$ for display equations, so I'll follow that. Also, check for any typos in the original problem. The original problem has \\displaystyle and \\quad, which can be simplified. The binomial coefficient is \\binom{2n}{n}, and the inequalities are as given. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is an integer,\nn > 1.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\frac{4^{n}}{\\sqrt{4n}}<\\binom{2n}{n}<\\frac{4^{n}}{\\sqrt{3n+1}}$$ for all $n > 1$.\n\nI think that's it. The user's attempt and the mention of Stirling's formula are part of their own work, not the problem's assumptions. So they don't need to be included in the formatted problem. The key is to extract only the necessary conditions and the problem statement from the original question, ignoring any attempts or additional questions.",
