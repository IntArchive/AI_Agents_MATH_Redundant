    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to prove that the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n is Big O of log(n), specifically using induction. Hmm, induction can be tricky here because the harmonic series grows logarithmically, and induction usually requires relating the nth term to the (n-1)th term.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of Big O notation. A function f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exists a constant C and a value n₀ such that for all n ≥ n₀, |f(n)| ≤ C|g(n)|. In this case, f(n) is the harmonic number H_n, and g(n) is log(n). So we need to show that H_n ≤ C log(n) for some C and sufficiently large n.\n\nBut the user mentions using induction. Typically, for induction, we need a base case and then assume it's true for n and prove for n+1. Let me think. If I assume H_n ≤ C log(n), then H_{n+1} = H_n + 1/(n+1). So we need to show that H_n + 1/(n+1) ≤ C log(n+1). If I can relate log(n+1) to log(n), maybe using the inequality log(n+1) ≤ log(n) + 1/n or something similar? Wait, actually, log(n+1) = log(n) + log(1 + 1/n). And log(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1/n - 1/(2n²) + ..., which is less than 1/n. So log(n+1) ≤ log(n) + 1/n. \n\nBut then if we have H_n ≤ C log(n), adding 1/(n+1) gives H_{n+1} ≤ C log(n) + 1/(n+1). We need this to be ≤ C log(n+1). So substituting the inequality for log(n+1), we have C log(n) + 1/(n+1) ≤ C (log(n) + 1/n). Wait, but 1/(n+1) ≤ C * (1/n). So rearranging, we need C ≥ n/(n+1). But as n increases, n/(n+1) approaches 1, so C must be at least 1. But if C is 1, then H_{n+1} ≤ log(n) + 1/(n+1) ≤ log(n+1) + 1/(n+1) - [log(n+1) - log(n)]. Wait, this might not hold directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps induction isn't the most straightforward method here. The standard approach to bound H_n is by comparing it to the integral of 1/x, which gives H_n ≤ 1 + log(n). But the user insists on using induction. Maybe we can use that integral bound as part of the induction hypothesis. Let's try.\n\nBase case: n=1, H_1 =1. log(1)=0, so 1 ≤ C*0? That doesn't work. Hmm, so maybe the base case has to start at n=2. Let's check n=2. H_2 = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5. log(2) ≈0.693. So we need C such that 1.5 ≤ C * 0.693, which would require C ≥ 1.5 / 0.693 ≈2.164. Maybe set C=2. Then check if the induction step works.\n\nAssume for some n ≥2, H_n ≤ 2 log(n). Then H_{n+1} = H_n + 1/(n+1) ≤ 2 log(n) + 1/(n+1). We need this to be ≤2 log(n+1). So 2 log(n) +1/(n+1) ≤2 log(n+1). Rearranging, 1/(n+1) ≤2[log(n+1) - log(n)] =2 log(1 +1/n). We need to verify if 1/(n+1) ≤2 log(1 +1/n). Let's check for n=2: 1/3 ≈0.333, 2 log(1.5)≈2*0.405≈0.810. So 0.333 ≤0.810, holds. For n=3: 1/4=0.25, 2 log(4/3)≈2*0.287≈0.574, which holds. As n increases, log(1+1/n) ≈1/n -1/(2n²). So 2 log(1+1/n) ≈2/n -1/n². Compare to 1/(n+1)≈1/n -1/n². So 2/n -1/n² ≥1/n -1/n² for n≥1. Thus 2 log(1+1/n) ≥1/(n+1) for all n≥1. Therefore, the inequality holds. Thus, the induction step works if we take C=2 and start from n=2. But the original problem says \"for all n\", so maybe adjust the base case. If we set C=2, then for n=1: H_1=1 ≤2 log(1)=0, which isn't true. So perhaps the statement holds for n≥2, and we can adjust the constant or shift the index. Alternatively, take a larger C. For example, if we take C=2, then for n=1, 1 ≤2*0, which fails. So maybe the base case is n=2, and for n=1, it's trivial since O(log n) allows any constant. Wait, Big O notation is about asymptotic behavior, so it's sufficient to prove for n ≥n₀. So we can start induction at n=2, with C=2, and for n=1, since it's a finite value, it's absorbed into the Big O constant. So the induction would work for n≥2, and the base case holds. Therefore, the proof by induction is possible with C=2 and n₀=2. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be structured with the assumption that the induction starts at n=2 and uses the constant C=2. However, in the original problem statement, the user didn't specify starting at a particular n, so the assumption should include that n is a positive integer and perhaps that n is sufficiently large (n ≥2). But in the example given, the assumption listed was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove the Big O bound using induction, so the key assumptions would relate to the induction steps, like the base case and the induction hypothesis.\n\nWait, but the user's example had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So in the current problem, the assumptions would be that n is an integer, and maybe n ≥1. However, since the induction requires a base case, perhaps n being a positive integer is the main assumption. The problem statement itself is to prove the Big O bound using induction. So the formatted problem should list the assumptions (n is a positive integer) and the problem statement. But in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, maybe the assumption is simply that n is a positive integer. However, the user might have included in their example an incorrect assumption (like n divisible by 7) which was part of the original problem. In this case, the problem is about harmonic series and Big O, so the key assumption is n is a positive integer. But the original problem's title says \"with induction\", so maybe the assumption is that induction is the method to be used. However, in the example, the assumption was about the properties of the object (n being integer, divisible by 7). So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is a positive integer.\n\nBut that's very basic. Alternatively, maybe there's an implicit assumption in the induction step, like n ≥ some value. But the user didn't specify. Therefore, perhaps the problem as structured should have:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n} = \\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ using induction.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions \"with induction\" in the title, but the problem statement in the question says \"with induction. I get the intuition...\". So the problem is to prove the Big O bound using induction. Hence, the problem part should mention \"using induction\". So the formatted problem would have the assumption that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to prove the harmonic series is O(log n) using induction.",
