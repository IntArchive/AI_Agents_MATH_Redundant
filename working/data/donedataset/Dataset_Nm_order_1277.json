    "Content": "For a matrix $A$, if $\\det(A)=0,$ prove and provide an example that at least one eigenvalue must be zero. At first, I tried using the identity that the product of eigenvalues is the determinant of the matrix, so it follows that at least one must be zero for the determinant to be zero. Is this correct? Could I also prove it by using $(A-\\lambda I)X=0$, for some $X\\neq 0?$ If $\\lambda=0,$ then we have $AX=0$, but I can't say $\\det(A)\\cdot \\det(X)=0$ because $X$ is not a square matrix and doesn't have a determinant. How would I continue?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $p(x)=\\det(A-xI)$ the char. polynomial of $A$. Then $p(0)=\\det(A)=0$, hence $0$ is a root of $p$ and therefore an eigenvalue of $A$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the task is to prove that if the determinant of a matrix A is zero, then at least one eigenvalue must be zero. Also, provide an example. Let's start by recalling some linear algebra concepts.\n\nFirst, I remember that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. So if the determinant is zero, then the product of all eigenvalues must be zero. If a product of numbers is zero, at least one of them has to be zero. That seems straightforward. So maybe the first approach the user mentioned is correct. But let me check if there are any conditions here. Does this apply to any square matrix? The problem just says \"a matrix A,\" so I assume it's a square matrix since determinants are defined only for square matrices. So the first assumption is that A is a square matrix.\n\nNow, the determinant being zero implies that the matrix is singular, meaning it doesn't have an inverse. A singular matrix has a non-trivial kernel, so there exists a non-zero vector X such that AX = 0. Wait, that's exactly the equation AX = 0 when lambda is zero. So if lambda is an eigenvalue, then there exists a non-zero X where AX = lambda X. If lambda is zero, then AX = 0, which is exactly the case when X is in the kernel. So if the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, so the kernel has at least one non-zero vector, which would be an eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue zero. Therefore, zero must be an eigenvalue.\n\nBut the user mentioned trying to use (A - lambda I)X = 0. If we set lambda to zero, then it's AX = 0. The existence of a non-trivial solution X (since det(A) = 0 implies A is singular) means that 0 is an eigenvalue. So both approaches seem valid. The first approach using the product of eigenvalues equals determinant, and the second approach using the definition of eigenvalues.\n\nBut wait, the user was confused about using determinants in the second approach. They said, \"If lambda=0, then we have AX=0, but I can't say det(A) det(X) = 0 because X is not a square matrix...\" Hmm, right, X is a vector, not a matrix, so determinant isn't defined here. So maybe they tried to take determinants on both sides, but that's not the right approach. Instead, the fact that AX=0 has a non-trivial solution is equivalent to A being singular, which is equivalent to det(A)=0. So the existence of such an X directly implies that 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nSo the key points here are:\n\n1. A is a square matrix (since determinant is involved).\n2. det(A) = 0 implies that the product of eigenvalues is zero.\n3. Therefore, at least one eigenvalue must be zero.\n4. Alternatively, det(A) = 0 implies A is singular, so there exists X ≠ 0 such that AX = 0, which means 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nFor an example, consider a 2x2 matrix with rows [1, 0] and [0, 0]. The determinant is 0, and the eigenvalues are 1 and 0. So yes, one eigenvalue is zero. Another example is the zero matrix; all its eigenvalues are zero.\n\nBut wait, the problem also asks to provide an example. So maybe the example should be included in the formatted problem. However, looking at the example given in the user's instruction, the original problem included an example request, but in the formatted problem, only the problem part was written. Wait, no, the example given by the user had the original problem and the formatted problem. The original problem included both proving and providing an example. So in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" part would include both. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"How to prove that if the determinant of the matrix is zero then at least one eigenvalue must be zero? For a matrix A, if det(A)=0, prove and provide an example that at least one eigenvalue must be zero.\"\n\nSo the problem statement includes both proving and providing an example. So in the formatted problem, the \"Problem\" part should say \"Prove and provide an example that if det(A)=0, then at least one eigenvalue must be zero.\"\n\nBut according to the format given, the user wants to structure the problem into Assumption and Problem. So the assumptions would be the conditions given. The problem here is that the matrix A has det(A) = 0, and we need to prove that at least one eigenvalue is zero, and provide an example.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n\nBecause eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. The problem might not have stated that explicitly, but it's a necessary condition.\n\n- det(A) = 0.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. A is a square matrix.\n2. det(A) = 0.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that at least one eigenvalue of A is zero and provide an example.\n\nBut in the original user's example, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7\" even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, looking back at the example given:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the user's example shows that they modified the original problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That would actually change the problem. So perhaps in the example, the user was demonstrating how to structure a problem by possibly adding or clarifying assumptions. But that might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the example was a different problem.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" Then shows an example where the original problem is to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, and the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n,\" but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would narrow down the problem. So perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions, but in this case, maybe the original problem had a typo, or the example is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user is demonstrating filtering unrelated information. But in any case, I need to follow the user's format.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question says \"For a matrix A, if det(A)=0, prove and provide an example that at least one eigenvalue must be zero.\"\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n- A is a matrix (but must be square for determinant and eigenvalues to exist)\n- det(A) = 0\n\nBut the problem statement might not explicitly state that A is square. However, determinant is only defined for square matrices, so it's implicit. But to be thorough, the assumptions should include that A is a square matrix.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- A is a square matrix,\n- det(A) = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve and provide an example that at least one eigenvalue of A must be zero.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem's formatted version included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the user's approach is to list all necessary conditions, even if some are implicit.\n\nIn our current case, even though the original problem didn't explicitly say \"A is a square matrix,\" since determinant is involved, we must assume A is square. Therefore, the assumptions should include that.\n\nSo the final answer would list those two assumptions and the problem statement as given.",
