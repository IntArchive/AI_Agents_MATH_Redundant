    "Content": "My question is in the title: Is it possible to find $n≥4$ such that $2^n$ is a palindromic number (in base $10$)? A palindromic number is a number which is the same, independently from which side we read it (forwards and backwards), for example $121, 484, 55755$. My guess is \"no\". I know that a palindromic number $x$ with even length (i.e. the number of digits $\\max\\{n : 10^n \\mid x\\}$ is even) is a multiple of $11$: see here or here or here . In particular, a power of $2$ with an even length can't be a palindromic number. However, I don't know what to do with the case of an odd length. For instance, if $x=abcdcba$, then $abccba$ is a multiple of $11$, but I don't see how this can help. Here is a related question. On MathOverflow, related questions are: (1) and (2) . Maybe also this thread (since $(1)$ is focused on binary expansion). I tried with Mathematica and there is no palindromic power of $2$ with exponent $n<10000$: palindromeQ[n_] := IntegerDigits[n] === Reverse@IntegerDigits[n];\n For[i = 1, i < 10000, i++, If[PalindromeQ[2^i], Print[i]] ] Finally, I think that the answer will be the same if we replace $2$ by any integer $n>1$ which is not a multiple of $11$. I don't know how I could prove (even for the case of even length…) that $11^n$ is not a palindromic number for $n≥5$. Any hint will be helpful. Thank you!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking if there exists a palindromic power of 2 with exponent n ≥ 4. They mentioned that for even-length numbers, palindromes are divisible by 11, so since 2^n isn't divisible by 11, those can't be palindromes. But they're stuck on the odd-length case.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is whether any power of 2 (with n ≥4) is a palindrome in base 10. The user's assumptions or given conditions are:\n\n1. The number in question is a power of 2, i.e., 2^n.\n2. The exponent n is at least 4.\n3. A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.\n4. They mentioned that even-length palindromes are multiples of 11, which 2^n can't be. So for even lengths, it's impossible. The problem then is about odd-length palindromic numbers.\n\nWait, the user's problem is about both even and odd lengths, but they have a partial result for even lengths. However, the main question is whether there exists any such n ≥4. The assumptions here would be:\n\n- The object is 2^n.\n- n is an integer greater than or equal to 4.\n- The number 2^n is a palindrome in base 10.\n\nBut the user didn't state that 2^n must be a palindrome as an assumption; that's the problem itself. The assumptions are the conditions given. Wait, the example given in the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem had assumptions like \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, the problem is to prove that 2^n (for n ≥4) is not a palindrome. But the user is asking if it's possible. Wait, the user's question is \"Is there any palindromic power of 2?\" So the problem is to determine existence. However, the user's own analysis shows that for even-length numbers, it's impossible, but they need to handle the odd-length case.\n\nBut how to structure this as per the format. The user's problem is the question: Is there n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10? The assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 number.\n- A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nBut in the example given, assumptions were specific conditions that the problem applies. Wait, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\", problem is to prove A(n) divisible by 91.\n\nIn this case, the problem is a question, not a proof. The user is asking if such n exists. So how to structure this? The assumptions would be the given conditions. So the problem is \"Is there any n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number?\" The assumptions would be the conditions that must hold:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 number.\n- Palindromic number definition: same forwards and backwards.\n\nBut wait, in the example, they listed the assumptions as properties of the objects involved. For the problem given here, the key assumptions are that n is an integer ≥4, and that 2^n is a base 10 number (since the question is about base 10). The palindromic property is part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nSo the formatted problem should list the conditions that are given. The problem is to determine existence of n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindrome. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- The number 2^n is represented in base 10.\n\nProblem: Is there any n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number?\n\nWait, but the original problem also mentions that the user checked up to n=10000 and found none. So maybe there are additional implicit assumptions, but the key is to extract the problem's explicit assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's problem is to prove that there is no such n ≥4 where 2^n is a palindrome, given that even-length cases are ruled out by divisibility by 11. But the actual problem as stated in the title is a yes/no question. However, the user is trying to prove that the answer is no. But the original question is phrased as \"Is there any...\", so the problem is to answer that. But according to the format example, the problem is stated as a directive (Prove that...). In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which was restated as the problem.\n\nIn this case, the user's problem is a question, but perhaps the formatted problem should be phrased as \"Prove that there does not exist n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10.\" But the user hasn't proven it yet; they are asking for help. However, the example given in the format shows that the problem is restated as a directive (\"Prove that...\"), even if the original was a question. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that...\", so it was straightforward. Here, the original is a question, but the user is likely seeking a proof that no such n exists. So perhaps the formatted problem should be \"Prove that for all integers n ≥4, 2^n is not a palindromic number in base 10.\"\n\nBut the user's actual question is \"Is there any...\", which is an existence question. However, in the example, the problem was restated as a \"Prove that...\" So perhaps here, the problem would be to \"Prove that there does not exist an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10.\" But the user's own analysis shows that for even-length numbers, it's impossible, but odd-length is still open.\n\nAlternatively, if following the example's approach, the assumptions would list the conditions given. The problem's assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 number.\n- A palindromic number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions here are:\n\n- n is an integer with n ≥4.\n- The number 2^n is considered in base 10.\n- Palindromic numbers have the same digits forwards and backwards.\n\nBut the problem is whether such a number exists. However, the example had assumptions as specific conditions applied to one object. For instance, in the example, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 number.\n- The number 2^n must be a palindrome.\n\nWait, but the problem is to determine if such n exists, so the assumptions are the conditions that n must satisfy. Therefore, the problem is \"Is there an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10?\" So the formatted problem's assumptions would list:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 palindromic number.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were the given conditions for the problem. The problem in the example was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is more of a general question without additional constraints beyond n≥4. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a number in base 10.\n\nAnd the problem is whether it is a palindrome. But the palindrome is the property to check, not an assumption. Hmm, perhaps the example's approach was to list the assumptions that are given in the problem. In the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer (as part of \"for every integer n\"), and the formatted problem listed that as an assumption, but the original problem also had an additional assumption (n divisible by 7) which was part of the user's mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe that was an error in the example. However, assuming the example is correct as per the user's instruction, perhaps the task is to extract the conditions that are necessary for the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. For instance, in the example, perhaps the original problem had a typo or required n to be divisible by 7, but the user restructured it. But regardless, following the user's example, we need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a number in base 10.\n- A palindromic number is defined as one whose digits are the same forwards and backwards.\n\nBut the problem is to determine existence. However, the example formatted the problem as a directive (\"Prove that...\"), even though the original problem was a question. Therefore, perhaps here, the problem would be structured as \"Prove that there does not exist an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10,\" with assumptions being:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n- 2^n is a base 10 number.\n- Palindromic numbers have digits that read the same forwards and backwards.\n\nBut I think the key is to follow the example, where the assumptions are the given conditions that the problem requires. In the example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions were n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to determine existence, so the assumptions would be the conditions that must hold for the problem, which are n is integer, n ≥4, and 2^n is in base 10. The palindrome is the property to check. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\nAssumption: n ≥4.\nAssumption: 2^n is represented in base 10.\nProblem: Is 2^n a palindromic number?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem line is a statement to prove. The original example had \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Here, the user's question is a yes/no question, but the format might require it to be phrased as a directive. However, the user's own example shows that even if the original is a question, it's restated as a \"Prove that...\" So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that there does not exist an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10.\" But the user hasn't proven it yet; they are asking for help. Alternatively, maybe the problem is left as a question. However, the example's problem was a statement, so perhaps we need to follow that.\n\nBut the user's original title is \"Is there any palindromic power of 2?\" So the problem is to determine existence, but in the format, it should be phrased as a problem statement. The example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" So perhaps here, the problem is \"Prove that for all integers n ≥4, 2^n is not a palindromic number in base 10.\" But the user's question is whether such n exists, so the problem could be \"Determine whether there exists an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10.\" But according to the example's structure, it's better to convert the question into a statement to prove. Since the user's guess is \"no\", perhaps the problem is to prove that no such n exists.\n\nConsidering all this, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer.\nAssumption: n ≥4.\nProblem: Prove that 2^n is not a palindromic number in base 10.\n\nAlternatively, if the palindrome definition is considered an assumption:\n\nAssumption: A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.\nAssumption: n is an integer.\nAssumption: n ≥4.\nProblem: Prove that 2^n is not a palindromic number in base 10.\n\nBut the example didn't include definitions as assumptions. The example's assumptions were about the objects in the problem. So here, the assumptions would be the conditions on n: integer and ≥4. The problem is to prove 2^n is not a palindrome. However, the original user's problem includes that even-length palindromes are multiples of 11, but that's part of their reasoning, not an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions as:\n\n- n is an integer.\n- n ≥4.\n\nProblem: Prove that 2^n is not a palindromic number in base 10.\n\nBut the original question is whether such n exists, so the problem is to prove the non-existence. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as above.\n\nHowever, the user's original problem also mentions that they checked up to n=10000 and found none, but that's part of their attempt, not the problem's assumptions. So the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: n is an integer,\nn ≥4,\n2^n is represented in base 10,\nA palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.\nProblem: Prove that there does not exist an integer n ≥4 such that 2^n is a palindromic number in base 10.",
