    "Content": "In Thomae's  Function : $$\n\\begin{align}\nt(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if $x$ is irrational}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{n} & \\text{if $x = \\frac{m}{n}$ where $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}\n$$ I can prove the discontinuity at rational $b$ by taking a sequence of irrationals $x_n$ which converge to $b$. But while going through an argument for continuity at irrationals. \nI found this in a book. On the other hand if $b$ is an irrational number and $\\epsilon > 0$\n  then there is a     natural number $n_0$ such that $1/n_0 < \\epsilon$. There are only finite number of rationals with denominator less than\n  $n_0$ in the interval $(b-1,b+1)$. Hence we can find a $\\delta > 0$\n  such that $\\delta$ neighbourhood of $b$ contains no rational with\n  denominator less than $n_0$. I understand the rest of the proof. But I am unable to prove the emphasized text. Although I find it intuitive.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $m=n_0-1$, so we want to consider rationals with denominators $1,\\cdots,m$ in the interval $(b-1,b+1)$.  Since consecutive rationals with denominator k differ by $1/k$ and the interval $(b-1,b+1)$ has length 2, there are at most 2k rationals with denominator k in $(b-1,b+1)$. Therefore there are at most $2\\cdot1+2\\cdot2+\\cdots+2m$ rationals in $(b-1,b+1)$ with denominator less than $n_0$, so we can choose a $\\delta$ with $0<\\delta<|b-r|$, where r is the rational with denominator less than $n_0$ in $(b-1,b+1)$ which is closest to b.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The question is about the continuity of Thomae's Function at irrational points. The user mentions they can prove discontinuity at rationals but are stuck on the continuity at irrationals, specifically the part about finding a delta neighborhood around an irrational b that contains no rationals with denominator less than n_0.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement, the function t(x) is defined as 0 for irrational x and 1/n for x = m/n in lowest terms. The key points here are the definition of the function and the conditions for continuity at irrationals. \n\nThe assumptions would need to list each condition or property applied to one object. Let's break down the problem. The goal is to prove continuity at an irrational point b. For continuity, given any epsilon > 0, we need a delta such that the function's value is within epsilon of t(b) (which is 0) for all x within delta of b. Since t(x) is 0 at irrationals and 1/n at rationals, we need to ensure that near b, all rationals have 1/n < epsilon. \n\nThe book's argument says to choose n_0 such that 1/n_0 < epsilon. Then, there are only finitely many rationals in (b-1, b+1) with denominator less than n_0. Hence, we can find a delta neighborhood around b that excludes these finitely many points. \n\nAssumptions here would be:\n1. b is an irrational number.\n2. epsilon is a positive real number.\n3. There exists a natural number n_0 such that 1/n_0 < epsilon.\n4. In the interval (b-1, b+1), there are finitely many rationals with denominator less than n_0.\n5. A delta > 0 can be chosen such that the delta neighborhood around b contains none of these finite rationals.\n\nEach assumption is about a single property or condition. The problem is to prove the emphasized part, which is the existence of such a delta. So the problem statement would be to show that for the Thomae function, at an irrational b, given epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that the delta neighborhood of b contains no rationals with denominator less than n_0 (where n_0 satisfies 1/n_0 < epsilon).\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one condition. The problem is then the specific part the user is struggling with, which is proving the existence of such a delta.",
