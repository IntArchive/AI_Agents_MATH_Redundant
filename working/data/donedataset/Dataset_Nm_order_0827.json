    "Content": "Prove: If $f,g:S^{n-1} \\to X$ are homotopic maps, then $X\\sqcup_fD^n$ and $X\\sqcup_gD^n$ are homotopy equivalent. I think it can be proved by showing they are both deformation retracts of $X\\sqcup_H(D^n\\times I)$ where $H$ is the homotopy between $f$ and $g$. However, I have difficult in proving that the deformation retracts are continuous map. In fact, I have difficulty in representing a map in quotient spaces like $X\\sqcup_fD^n$. I think a map from $X\\sqcup_fD^n$ to $W$ can be represented by two maps: $m_1: X\\to W$, $m_2: D^n\\to W$, where for $x\\in S^{n-1}$, $m_1\\circ f(x)=m_2\\circ i(x)$. Then I construct the deformation retract this way: $m_1: X\\to X$. For $x\\in H(S^{n-1},t)$, $m_1(x)=H(S^{n-1},0)$, otherwise $m_1(x)=x$. $m_2: D^n\\times I\\to D^n\\times {0}$: $m_2((D^n,t))=(D^n,0)$. It is easy to verify that $m_1$ and $m_2$ define a map from $X\\sqcup_H(D^n\\times I)$ to $X\\sqcup_fD^n$. As long as this is a continous map, obvioulsy then we find a deformation retract. But it seems such a map is not continous?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "$\\require{AMScd}$ There is a retraction of $D^n\\times I\\twoheadrightarrow (D^n×\\{0\\})\\cup (S^{n-1}×I)$ defined via $$r(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\n\\left(\\frac{2x}{2-t},\\ 0\\right)             &\\text{, if }t\\le2(1-||x||) \\\\\n\\left(\\frac x{||x||},2-\\frac{2-t}{||x||}\\right)&\\text{, if }t\\ge2(1-||x||)\n\\end{cases}$$ It is easy to prove that this map is well-defined and continuous and a retraction. Then $$d:D^n×I×I\\to D^n×I\\\\ d(x,t,s)=sr(x,t)+(1-s)(x,t)$$ is a homotopy between the identity and $r$ , so $r$ is a deformation retraction.\nBut then $(D^n×I)\\cup_H X$ deformation retracts onto $(\\ (D^n×\\{0\\})\\cup (S^{n-1}×I)\\ )\\cup_H X=(D^n×\\{0\\})\\cup_f X$ Note that a pushout square ( $A,X$ , and $B$ are arbitrary spaces) \\begin{CD}\nA @>f>> B\\\\@ViVV @VV\\tilde iV\\\\ X @>>\\tilde f> X\\cup_f B\n\\end{CD} gives rise to a pushout square \\begin{CD}\nA\\times I @>f>> B \\times I\\\\@ViVV @VV\\tilde iV\\\\ X\\times I @>>\\tilde f> (X\\cup_f B)\\times I\n\\end{CD} because the quotient map $q:X\\sqcup B\\to X\\cup_f B$ induces a quotient map $q\\times 1:X\\times I\\sqcup B\\times I\\to(X\\cup_f B)\\times I$ . This means that a pair of homotopies $F_t:X→Y$ , $G_t:B→Y$ , such that $F_ti=G_t f$ for all $t\\in I$ , induces a homotopy $H_t:X∪_f B→Y$ That's the reason why a deformation retraction on $D^n×I$ induces a deformation retraction on the pushout $(D^n×I)\\cup_F X$ There is more general result: If $(X,A)$ is cofibered, then $X×I$ deformation retracts to $(X×\\{0\\})\\cup (A×I)$ , so if $X$ is glued via two homotopic maps $f$ and $g$ to a space $B$ , then $X\\cup_f B$ and $X\\cup_g B$ are homotopy equivalent.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking to prove that if two attaching maps f and g from S^{n-1} to X are homotopic, then the spaces formed by attaching a cell D^n via these maps are homotopy equivalent. The original approach considered using a deformation retract of X joined with D^n×I via the homotopy H. But the user is struggling with the continuity of the constructed maps in the quotient space.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The key elements here are:\n\n1. f and g are maps from S^{n-1} to X.\n2. f and g are homotopic, so there exists a homotopy H between them.\n3. The spaces in question are X attached with D^n via f and g respectively.\n4. The problem is to show these two spaces are homotopy equivalent.\n\nThe user's attempt involves constructing a deformation retract using the homotopy H. The challenge is ensuring continuity when dealing with quotient spaces. The assumptions should list each condition applied to the relevant objects. Let me structure them:\n\nAssumption: \n- f: S^{n-1} → X is a continuous map,\n- g: S^{n-1} → X is a continuous map,\n- H: S^{n-1} × I → X is a homotopy between f and g,\n- X is a topological space,\n- D^n is the n-dimensional disk,\n- The spaces X ∪_f D^n and X ∪_g D^n are formed by attaching D^n to X via f and g respectively.\n\nProblem: Prove that X ∪_f D^n and X ∪_g D^n are homotopy equivalent.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary assumptions. Each line addresses a single condition or property of an object involved. Now, checking the example given, the user listed each assumption line by line. The original problem mentions that f and g are homotopic, so H being the homotopy is an assumption. The spaces are constructed via attaching maps, so those are part of the setup. The problem statement is to show homotopy equivalence. That should fit the required format.",
