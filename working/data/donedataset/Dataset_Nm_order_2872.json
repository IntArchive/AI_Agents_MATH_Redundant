    "Content": "I'd like to solve this one similarly to my previous question: Is this a Valid proof for $(2n+1,3n+1)=1$? I did find a somewhat related post that uses a different method: How to show that $\\gcd(n! + 1, (n + 1)! + 1) \\mid n$? So how would I go about this? I can write the above like: $\\exists \\ d \\ \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ $n!+1 \\equiv 0$ (mod $d$) $(n+1)!+1 \\equiv 0$ (mod $d$) Not sure what to do next. Any hints? Thanks!",

In higher number theory you'll learn more precisely how linear algebra methods such as Gaussian elimination extend from fields to certain rings, e.g. google Hermite and Smith normal forms.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the greatest common divisor of n! + 1 and (n+1)! + 1 is 1. So, gcd(n! +1, (n+1)! +1) =1. \n\nFirst, let me recall how gcd works. If d divides both a and b, then d divides any linear combination of a and b. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. Let me try to apply that.\n\nLet me denote a = n! + 1 and b = (n+1)! +1. Then, since (n+1)! = (n+1)*n!, so b = (n+1)*n! +1. \n\nIf I subtract (n+1)*a from b, that might help. Let's compute b - (n+1)*a. \n\nb - (n+1)*a = [(n+1)! +1] - (n+1)*(n! +1)\n= (n+1)*n! +1 - (n+1)*n! - (n+1)\n= 1 - (n+1)\n= -n\n\nSo, this gives that d divides both a and b, so d divides b - (n+1)*a = -n. Therefore, d divides n and also divides a = n! +1. \n\nWait, so d divides both n! +1 and n. But if d divides n, then d must divide n!. Because n! is the product of numbers up to n, so any divisor of n would divide n!. But then d divides both n! and n! +1, which means d divides their difference, which is 1. Therefore, d must be 1. \n\nThat seems to work. So the key steps are using the Euclidean algorithm: gcd(a,b) = gcd(a, b - k*a) for some integer k. Here, choosing k = n+1 simplifies the expression, leading to the conclusion that d divides n. Then since d divides n and n! +1, and n and n! +1 are coprime (since any common divisor must divide 1), hence gcd is 1. \n\nLet me check with an example. Take n=2. Then a=2!+1=3, b=3!+1=7. gcd(3,7)=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example, n=3. a=7, b=25. gcd(7,25)=1. \n\nn=4. a=24+1=25, b=120+1=121. gcd(25,121)=1. Wait, 25 and 121 are both squares of primes, so yes. \n\nAnother test: n=5. a=120+1=121, b=720+1=721. gcd(121,721). 721 divided by 121 is 5 with remainder 721 -5*121=721-605=116. Then gcd(121,116). 121-116=5. gcd(116,5). 116=23*5 +1. gcd(5,1)=1. So yes, gcd is 1. \n\nSo the logic holds in these examples. Therefore, the proof is valid. The crucial step was expressing the gcd in terms of the Euclidean algorithm by subtracting (n+1)*a from b, which reduces the problem to showing that any common divisor must divide n and then 1. Hence, the gcd is 1.",
