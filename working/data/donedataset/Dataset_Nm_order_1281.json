    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. Let me first read the original question carefully.\n\nThe title is: \"A logarithmic integral ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1-x))]/(x√(1−x²)) dx\"\n\nThe question body says: How to prove the following ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1−x))]/(x√(1−x²)) dx = π²/2. The user mentions they thought of splitting the integral and using beta or hypergeometric functions but didn't think those were the best approaches. They're asking for other ideas.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem is about evaluating a definite integral from 0 to 1. Let's parse the integral:\n\nThe integrand is [log((1+x)/(1−x))] divided by [x√(1−x²)]. The integral is from 0 to 1. The result is supposed to be π²/2.\n\nSo, the assumptions here would be related to the variables and the conditions under which the integral is valid. Let's think:\n\n1. The integral is with respect to x, and the limits are from 0 to 1. So, x is a real variable in [0,1). Wait, but at x=1, the denominator becomes x√(1−x²), which would be 1*0, so the integrand has a potential singularity at x=1. Similarly, at x=0, log((1+0)/(1-0)) = log(1) = 0, so numerator is 0, denominator is 0*1=0. So, the integrand is also indeterminate at x=0. Therefore, the integral is improper at both limits. However, the problem states the integral from 0 to 1, so we assume that it converges.\n\nSo possible assumptions:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, 1).\n- The integrand function is defined for x in (0,1).\n- The integral is an improper integral, considering the limits as x approaches 0+ and 1−.\n\nBut the original problem states it as ∫₀¹, which is standard notation for an integral from 0 to 1, possibly improper if there are singularities. So maybe the key assumptions are just about the integral being improper at both ends, but the problem doesn't specify any particular conditions beyond the integral setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any explicit assumptions beyond the integral being as stated. Wait, in the example given, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions listed were that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should have been just \"n is an integer\". But the formatted version included \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but looking back, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Let me check:\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the assumption is n is any integer. However, the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, and the conclusion is that 91 divides A(n). But in reality, 91 = 7*13. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Because if n is divisible by both 6 and 7, then maybe A(n) is divisible by 91. Wait, but regardless, in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", so the example's formatted problem added an assumption that wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake.\n\nBut perhaps in the example, the user intended to filter out unrelated information. Wait, maybe the original problem had some other conditions, but in the given example, perhaps the correct assumptions were n is integer and n divisible by 7. But given that the original problem said \"for every integer n\", that seems conflicting. Maybe there was a typo or error in the example. But regardless, following the user's instruction, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nSo back to the current problem. The integral is from 0 to 1, with the integrand as given. The problem is to prove that the integral equals π²/2. What assumptions are inherent here?\n\nPossible assumptions:\n\n1. The variable x is real and in the interval (0,1).\n2. The integral is an improper Riemann integral evaluated as x approaches 0 from the right and x approaches 1 from the left.\n3. The logarithm function is defined for positive arguments, so (1+x)/(1−x) is positive. Since x ∈ [0,1), (1+x)/(1−x) is positive because numerator and denominator are both positive.\n\nBut perhaps more formally:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x is a real variable in the interval (0,1).\n- The integral ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1−x))]/[x√(1−x²)] dx is an improper integral at both limits x=0 and x=1.\n- The logarithm function log is the natural logarithm.\n\nWait, is there any assumption on the logarithm's base? Typically in such integrals, unless specified, it's natural logarithm, but maybe it's base 10? But given the result is π²/2, which is common in integrals involving natural logarithms. So maybe an assumption is that log is the natural logarithm. However, the original problem didn't specify, but in mathematics, log often denotes natural logarithm, especially in integrals involving π².\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nBut maybe the user didn't state that. However, since the problem is to prove the integral equals π²/2, which is a result that would come from natural logarithm integrals. So that's a safe assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the log were base 10, the result would involve (ln 10)^2 or something, which is not π². So we can safely assume natural logarithm.\n\nSo listing the assumptions line by line:\n\n1. The variable x is in the interval (0,1).\n2. The integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n3. The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nBut maybe these are all part of the problem statement, so perhaps the problem itself already includes these. The user is asking to prove the integral equals π²/2, so the integral is given with those limits and integrand. The assumptions would be the inherent conditions required for the integral to make sense. So each assumption should be a single condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- The integral ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1−x))]/[x√(1−x²)] dx is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n- The function log denotes the natural logarithm.\n- The integrand is defined for x ∈ (0,1).\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't require listing all these because they are inherent in the integral's expression. However, following the example, where assumptions included \"n is an integer\" even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", perhaps the assumptions here need to list each inherent condition.\n\nWait, in the example, even though the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So similarly, here, even though the integral is given from 0 to 1, we need to list assumptions about the variable x and the integral's nature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example had a mistake, but following the user's example, we should extract assumptions even if they are part of the problem statement.\n\nSo here, possible assumptions:\n\n1. The variable x is in the interval (0,1).\n2. The integral is taken as an improper Riemann integral at both limits x=0 and x=1.\n3. The logarithm function is natural logarithm.\n\nBut perhaps the integral being improper is part of the problem's setup, so that's an assumption. Similarly, x being in (0,1) is part of the integral's domain. But the problem statement doesn't mention the integral being improper; it just writes ∫₀¹. However, in standard calculus, if there are singularities at endpoints, it's understood as an improper integral. So maybe we should list that as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't need explicit assumptions beyond what's given, but according to the user's example, even obvious conditions are listed. For example, in the example, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" because the problem stated \"for every integer n\". So similarly, here, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n1. x is a real variable in the interval (0,1).\n2. The integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nBut the problem's integral is written as from 0 to 1, which inherently includes those points. So maybe that's redundant, but following the example, it's better to list them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral converges, but the problem is to prove its value, so convergence is part of the proof. Hence, maybe no assumptions are needed beyond what's given. But the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement.\n\nGiven the example, I think the user wants to extract the assumptions from the problem statement. However, the original problem here doesn't have additional conditions beyond the integral setup. The problem is to compute the integral, so the assumptions are inherent in the integral's definition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's structure. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions section can be empty? But the example shows that assumptions were extracted even from the problem's universal quantifier.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem's conclusion is for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That might be a mistake in the example. Because if n must be divisible by 7, then the original problem's statement is incorrect. So perhaps the example provided by the user is faulty. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem, the integral is from 0 to 1, with the given integrand. The assumptions needed would be the conditions required for the integral to be well-defined and converge. Since the integrand has singularities at x=0 and x=1, we can note that it's an improper integral. Also, the log argument must be positive, which it is for x in (0,1). The denominator x√(1−x²) is positive in (0,1). So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- x ∈ (0,1).\n- The integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n- The logarithm is natural.\n\nBut perhaps the problem doesn't need to state that x is in (0,1) because the integral is from 0 to 1. However, since at the endpoints the function is undefined, it's understood as the open interval. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1−x))]/[x√(1−x²)] dx is improper at both limits.\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem requires no additional assumptions beyond what's given, maybe the assumptions section is empty. But according to the example, even obvious conditions are listed.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, perhaps the safest way is to list the assumptions as:\n\n1. The integral is evaluated as an improper Riemann integral.\n2. The logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nBecause those are critical for the problem's setup. The variable x is already bound by the integral's limits, so maybe not necessary to list as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is part of the problem's quantifier. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumption is that the integral is over x from 0 to 1. But that's part of the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's example had a mistake, but following their instruction, when they said \"filter the unrelated informations\", perhaps in the original problem, there were more conditions, but the example filtered them. But in the current problem, the original question is straightforward. So perhaps the assumptions here are minimal.\n\nBut to adhere to the user's example format, I should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to 1.\n- The integrand is log((1+x)/(1-x)) divided by x√(1−x²).\n- The integral is improper at x=0 and x=1.\n- The logarithm is natural.\n\nBut the problem statement already specifies the integral from 0 to 1 and the integrand. So the key assumptions to list would be:\n\n1. The integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n2. The logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nBut does the problem require any other assumptions? For example, is there any condition on the convergence of the integral? The problem states to prove it equals π²/2, implying convergence, but the proof would need to show convergence as part of the solution. However, as an assumption, perhaps we need to state that the integral converges. But since the problem asks to prove the value, maybe convergence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the only assumption is that the logarithm is natural. But in mathematical contexts, that's standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions needed beyond the integral's expression, so the assumptions section is empty. But according to the example, they extracted assumptions even when they were part of the problem's statement.\n\nGiven the example, where the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumptions included \"n is an integer\", then here, even though the integral is stated as from 0 to 1, we should list that x is in (0,1), but that's part of the integral's domain. Alternatively, since the integral is written as ∫₀¹, which includes the endpoints, but the function is undefined there, so we must assume it's an improper integral.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\n- The logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nEach as separate points.\n\nProblem: Prove that ∫₀¹ [log((1+x)/(1−x))]/[x√(1−x²)] dx = π²/2.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is improper at x = 0 and x = 1.\nThe logarithm is the natural logarithm.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int^1_0 \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\right)}{x\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\,dx=\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}.$$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"log\" without specifying the base. But since the answer is π²/2, which relates to natural logarithm integrals (as ln(1+x) etc. integrals often involve π² terms), so we assume natural log. But if the problem had used a different base, the result would be scaled. Hence, it's a critical assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions should include that log is natural. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
