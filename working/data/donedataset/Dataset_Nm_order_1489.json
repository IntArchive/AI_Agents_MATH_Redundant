    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}$, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[4]{2})$. Then $K/F, L/K$ are degree $2$ extensions, hence normal (and Galois) but $L/F$ is not normal (the splitting field of $x^4 - 2$ has degree $8$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. Let me start by understanding the original problem.\n\nThe title is \"Is normal extension of normal extension always normal?\" The question body says: Let F be a char 0 field, K be a normal extension of F, and L be a normal extension of K. Can it be proved or disproved that L is normal extension of F?\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the given example again to make sure. In the example, the original problem had an integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but in the original example, the user's formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem under the example has assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Hmm, but wait, that might be a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, the assumption that n is divisible by 7 would restrict it, but maybe that example was part of a different problem? Maybe the user provided a different example. But regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nSo in the current problem, the user's original question is about field extensions. The problem states that F has characteristic 0, K is a normal extension of F, L is a normal extension of K. The question is whether L is normal over F.\n\nSo the assumptions here are:\n\n1. F is a field of characteristic 0.\n2. K is a normal extension of F.\n3. L is a normal extension of K.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to different objects (F, K, L). So each line should be a single condition on one object. The problem is to prove or disprove that L is a normal extension of F.\n\nI need to list the assumptions as three separate points. The problem statement is whether L is normal over F. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions are each of those three conditions, and the problem is to prove or disprove that L is normal over F.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"Can it be proved or disproved that L is normal extension of F?\" So the problem is to determine whether L is necessarily a normal extension of F, given those assumptions. So in the formatted problem, the problem part is \"Prove or disprove that L is a normal extension of F.\"\n\nBut the example given in the user's format uses \"Prove that...\". However, the original problem here is asking whether it can be proved or disproved, so perhaps the problem statement should be \"Prove or disprove that L is a normal extension of F.\"\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- F is a field of characteristic 0,\n- K is a normal extension of F,\n- L is a normal extension of K.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that L is a normal extension of F.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. However, the formatted problem in the example lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. But the original problem was for every integer n, so the assumption \"n is an integer\" is correct, but why \"n is divisible by 7\"? That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example was miswritten. Or perhaps the example is from a different problem. Wait, maybe the original example was to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the user wanted to split the problem into cases where n is divisible by 7 or 13? But that's speculative. Anyway, perhaps the example was not correctly formatted. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original assumptions are:\n\n- F is a field of characteristic 0.\n\n- K is a normal extension of F.\n\n- L is a normal extension of K.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So each should be listed line by line. Then the problem is to prove or disprove that L is normal over F.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check again. The original question is asking whether L must be normal over F, given that F has char 0, K is normal over F, and L is normal over K. So yes, that's exactly the structure.",
