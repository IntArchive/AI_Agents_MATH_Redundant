    "AcceptedAnswer": "Apostol gives a proof of this in his book . Here's a more-or-less condensed version: Letting $[p]$ be an Iverson bracket ( $1$ if condition $p$ is true, and $0$ if $p$ is false), we have $\\sum\\limits_{p \\le n}\\frac1{p}=\\sum\\limits_{k \\le n}\\frac{[k\\in\\mathbb P]}{k}$ Introduce the function $\\ell(n)=\\sum\\limits_{p \\le n}\\frac{\\log\\,p}{p}=\\sum\\limits_{k \\le n}\\frac{[k\\in\\mathbb P]\\log\\,k}{k}$ . Making use of (a special case of) Abel's identity, $$\\sum_{y < n \\le x}\\frac{a(n)}{\\log\\,n}=\\frac{A(x)}{\\log\\,x}-\\frac{A(y)}{\\log\\,y}+\\int_y^x \\frac{A(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt$$ where for this case $a(n)=\\frac{[n\\in\\mathbb P]\\log\\,n}{n}$ and $A(x)=\\sum\\limits_{k \\le x}a(k)$ . Taking $y=2$ , we have $$\\sum_{p \\le n}\\frac1{p}=\\frac{\\ell(n)}{\\log\\,n}+\\int_2^n \\frac{\\ell(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt$$ Since $\\ell(n)=\\log\\,n+O(1)$ , we then have $$\\begin{align*}\\sum_{p \\le n}\\frac1{p}&=1+O\\left(\\frac1{\\log\\,n}\\right)+\\int_2^n \\frac1{t\\log\\,t}\\mathrm dt+\\int_2^n \\frac{\\mathfrak{R}(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt\\\\&=1+O\\left(\\frac1{\\log\\,n}\\right)+\\log\\log\\,n-\\log\\log\\,2+\\int_2^n \\frac{\\mathfrak{R}(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt\\end{align*}$$ where $\\mathfrak{R}(t)=O(1)$ . Since $$\\int_2^n \\frac{\\mathfrak{R}(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt=\\int_2^\\infty \\frac{\\mathfrak{R}(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt+O\\left(\\frac1{\\log\\,n}\\right)$$ making the appropriate replacements gives $$\\sum_{p \\le n}\\frac1{p}=\\color{blue}{1-\\log\\log\\,2+\\int_2^\\infty \\frac{\\mathfrak{R}(t)}{t(\\log\\,t)^2}\\mathrm dt}+\\log\\log\\,n+O\\left(\\frac1{\\log\\,n}\\right)$$ where the blue part is the constant term $C$ in the OP.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving an equation involving the sum of reciprocals of primes up to n. The equation is given as: for all n > 2, the sum equals a constant C plus ln ln n plus an error term that's Big O of 1 over ln n. \n\nNow, the assumptions. The problem states \"forall n > 2\", so the first assumption is n is an integer greater than 2. Then, the sum is over primes p less than or equal to n, so p is a prime number. Also, the equation includes a constant C, which I assume is some specific constant related to prime reciprocals, maybe like Mertens' constant. But the user didn't mention C's value, so perhaps no assumption is needed on C. The error term is Big O, which is standard notation, so maybe assuming knowledge of asymptotic notation is okay, but the problem structure in the example didn't include that. The example only included explicit conditions on variables in the problem. So the main assumptions here are about n and p. \n\nWait, the original problem mentions p is a prime number. So the sum is over primes p ≤ n. Therefore, the assumptions should list that p is a prime number, n is an integer greater than 2, and each term in the sum is 1/p. But the problem statement itself is to prove the asymptotic formula. \n\nWait, the example given had assumptions on n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the original problem states \"forall n > 2\", so n must be an integer greater than 2. Also, p is a prime number. So I should list those. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted assumptions listed n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, n is any integer, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, looking back, the user's example might have had a typo. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted version, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect? Because if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", then the assumption should just be n is an integer. But in the formatted version, they added n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was modified to include a specific case? Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I should follow the instructions given.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction: \"Assumption: All the assumptions... applied to one object\". So for the current problem, the problem statement is to prove the sum of reciprocals of primes ≤n equals C + ln ln n + O(1/ln n). The assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 2.\n\n- p is a prime number.\n\nBut wait, the sum is over primes p ≤ n, so p is a prime number, and n is an integer >2. Additionally, the asymptotic notation O(1/ln n) is part of the problem statement, but maybe we don't need to list assumptions about that unless there's a specific condition on the error term. But the problem as stated is to prove the equation holds with that error term, so perhaps the assumptions are only about n and p.\n\nSo, the assumptions should be:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n\n2. n > 2.\n\n3. p is a prime number.\n\nEach assumption on one line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nThe problem statement is the equation given. So putting it all together.",
