    "Content": "This is an exercise from Ian Stewart's Galois Theory , $3^{rd}$ edition: If $z_1,z_2,\\ldots,z_n$ are distinct complex numbers, show that the determinant $$D=\\left|\\begin{array}[cccc] \n11&1&\\cdots&1\\\\\nz_1&z_2&\\cdots&z_n\\\\\nz_1^2&z_2^2&\\cdots&z_n^2\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\nz_1^{n-1}&z_2^{n-1}&\\cdots&z_n^{n-1}\n\\end{array}\\right|$$\n  is nonzero. Hint: Consider the $z_j$ as independent indeterminates over $\\Bbb C$. Then $D$ is a polynomial in the $z_j$, of total degree $0+1+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$. Moreover, $D$ vanishes whenever $z_j=z_k$ for $k\\neq j$, as it then has two identical rows. Therefore $D$ is divisible by $z_j-z_k$ for all $j\\neq k$, hence it is divisible by $\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)$. Now compare degrees. My question is how to do this. I follow the hint and I'm thinking of $D$ as a cofactor expansion; is that the idea? Also, the fact that $D$ vanishes whenever $z_j=z_k$ for $k\\neq j$ follows since it would have two identical columns, right? I don't see why $z_j=z_k$ would imply it has two identical rows, as the hint suggests. The fact that it is divisible by $(z_j-z_k)$ is easy since that would make $z_k$ a root for $k=j$, but I'm not quite sure I follow why the degrees would be different. I think the degree of the product would be $1+2+\\cdots+(k-1)$, but then add these up for all $k<n$? I appreciate any clarification that you can provide!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The hint that Stewart is proving is basically asking you to prove that the Vandermonde determinant above is a scalar multiple of $$\\prod_{1 \\leq j < k \\leq n } (z_k - z_j).$$ Once you have done this, there is no way for the product to be zero as that would mean that some $z_k = z_j$ , contradicting the fact that all your complex numbers were distinct to start out with. More on Stewart's hint: Can you see why the determinant above is a homogeneous polynomial in the variables $z_1,\\ldots,z_n$ of degree $1 + 2 + \\ldots + (n-1) =\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ? Once you see why it will suffice to add up the degrees of the terms along the main diagonal. Now suppose the Vandermonde determinant above is divisible by the product $\\prod_{1 \\leq j < k\\leq n } (z_k - z_j)$ . Then if the degree of the Vandermonde determinant is equal to the degree of that product above, your problem is done by the division algorithm. Now what is the degree of the polynomial $\\prod_{1 \\leq j < k \\leq n } (z_k - z_j)$ ? The degree of that polynomial is the number of factors in the product. The number of factors is precisely the number of ways to choose two things from $n$ things without repeats (that's what the $j < k$ condition is saying). This is precisely $$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n!}{(n-2)!2!} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$ If you're not entirely convinced of Stewart's approach above here is a proof by induction. Replace all your $z_n's$ above with $x_n's$ (sorry about this).\nSet $V_n$ to be equal to the $n \\times n$ Vandermonde determinant above. We claim that the determinant of the $n \\times n$ matrix is given by $$ \\text{det}(V_n) = \\prod_{1\\leq i < j \\leq n} (x_j - x_i). $$ We prove by induction: the basis step for $n=2$ is easy enough. So suppose the formula for det $(V_n)$ in terms of a product above holds for $n=k$ . Then for $n=k+1$ , we perform column operations (and later, row operations) to get $$\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\text{det} (V_{k+1}) &=& \\text{det} \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 1& x_1 & x_1^2& \\ldots& x_1^{k} \\\\ 1 &x_2 & x_2^2 & \\ldots& x_2^{k} \\\\ \\vdots &&&& \\vdots \\\\  1&x_{k+1} & x_{k+1}^2 &\\ldots &x_{k+1}^{k}  \\end{array} \\right]  \n\\\\&=& \n\\text{det}\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 1& 0 & 0& \\ldots& 0\\\\ 1 &x_2 - x_1 & x_2(x_2 - x_1) & \\ldots& x_2^{k-1}(x_2 - x_1) \\\\ \\vdots &&&& \\vdots \\\\  1&x_{k+1} - x_1& x_{k+1}(x_{k+1} - x_1) &\\ldots &x_{k+1}^{k-1}(x_{k+1} - x_1)  \\end{array} \\right]  \n\\\\\n\\\\ &=& \\prod_{i=2}^{k+1}(x_i - x_1)\n\\text{det}  \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} 1& 0 & 0& \\ldots& 0\\\\ 1 &1 & x_2 & \\ldots& x_2^{k-1} \\\\ \\vdots &&& \\vdots \\\\  1&1& x_{k+1} &\\ldots &x_{k+1}^{k-1}  \\end{array} \\right]  \\\\ \\\\\n&=&  \\Bigg[ \\prod_{i=2}^{k+1}(x_i - x_1) \\Bigg] \\prod_{2 \\leq i<j \\leq k+1} (x_j -x_i) \\quad (\\text{ induction hypothesis}) \\\\ \\\\ &=& \\prod_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq k+1} (x_j - x_i). \\end{array} $$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about showing that the Vandermonde determinant is nonzero when given distinct complex numbers. The user also mentions some hints from the book, discussing treating the z_j as indeterminates, the determinant being a polynomial, and divisibility by the product of differences (z_j - z_k). The user is confused about why the determinant vanishes when z_j = z_k and the degree comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. The problem states that z_1, z_2, ..., z_n are distinct complex numbers. That's one assumption. But looking at the hint, there's more: considering z_j as independent indeterminates over C, which might be another assumption. However, the problem itself as stated in the question doesn't mention treating them as indeterminates; that's part of the hint. The actual problem's assumption is just that the z_j are distinct. But the hint suggests a method using polynomial properties. However, in the formatted problem example, assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the hints. So the main assumption here is that the z_j are distinct complex numbers. The problem is to show that the determinant D is nonzero.\n\nWait, the problem as presented in the user's example includes assumptions from the original problem. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original. Wait no, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, actually, the example shows that the user restructured the problem, perhaps filtering out unrelated info. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example is from a different problem where the user made a mistake. But regardless, the task here is to structure the given problem as per the format.\n\nSo for the current problem: the user's question is about showing the Vandermonde determinant is nonzero when the z_j are distinct. The problem statement in the question is: \"If z_1,z_2,...,z_n are distinct complex numbers, show that the determinant D is nonzero.\" The assumptions here are that z_1,...,z_n are distinct complex numbers. But in the hint, there's a method involving treating them as indeterminates, which leads to considering D as a polynomial. However, the problem itself doesn't state that they are indeterminates; that's part of the solution approach. Therefore, the only assumption for the problem as posed is that the z_j are distinct complex numbers. The rest of the hint is part of the solution method, not the problem's assumptions. So the formatted problem should list the assumption as \"z_1, z_2, ..., z_n are distinct complex numbers\" and the problem is to show that D is nonzero.\n\nBut wait, the example given by the user included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a confusion in the example. However, the user might have intended that sometimes assumptions need to be extracted even if not explicitly stated. But in the current problem, the original question clearly states that the z_j are distinct. Therefore, the assumption should be that they are distinct complex numbers. The problem is to prove D is nonzero. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nz_1, z_2, ..., z_n are distinct complex numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the determinant\n$$D=\\left|\\begin{array}[cccc] \n11&1&\\cdots&1\\\\\nz_1&z_2&\\cdots&z_n\\\\\nz_1^2&z_2^2&\\cdots&z_n^2\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\nz_1^{n-1}&z_2^{n-1}&\\cdots&z_n^{n-1}\n\\end{array}\\right|$$\nis nonzero.\n\nBut wait, the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. For example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted version added \"n is divisible by 7\". So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, the example might have been from a different problem where the user's formatted version added an assumption. But in the current problem, the original question already includes the necessary assumption: the z_j are distinct. So in this case, the assumption is only that. However, the hint in the question mentions treating z_j as indeterminates, but that's part of the solution method, not the problem's assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the given assumption, which is the distinctness of the complex numbers. The problem is to show D is nonzero. Therefore, the final answer should reflect that.",
