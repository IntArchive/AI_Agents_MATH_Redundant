    "AcceptedAnswer": "The complex roots of $x^5-1$ are: $$\n\\begin{align}\nx_1&=1\\\\\nx_2&=\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}5+i\\sin\\frac{2\\pi}5\\\\\nx_3&=-\\cos\\frac{\\pi}5+i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}5\\\\\nx_4&=-\\cos\\frac{\\pi}5-i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}5\\\\\nx_5&=\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}5-i\\sin\\frac{2\\pi}5\n\\end{align}\n$$ using Vieta's formulas you get $$0=x_1+x_2+\\dots+x_5=1+2\\left(\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}5-\\cos\\frac\\pi5\\right)=0,$$ which yields your first equation. From now on, let $\\varphi=\\frac{\\pi}5$ (for brevity). We know that $\\cos2\\varphi-\\cos\\varphi+\\frac12=(2\\cos^2\\varphi-1)-\\cos\\varphi+\\frac12=2\\cos^2\\varphi-\\cos\\varphi-\\frac12=0$ , i.e. $$2\\cos^2\\varphi-\\cos\\varphi=\\frac12.$$ Now from $\\cos2\\varphi=\\cos\\varphi-\\frac12$ you get $$\\cos\\varphi\\cos2\\varphi=\\cos^2\\varphi-\\frac{\\cos\\varphi}2=\\frac{2\\cos^2\\varphi-\\cos\\varphi}2=\\frac14.$$ (Or, as suggested in Chandrasekhar's answer, from $2\\cos^2\\varphi-\\cos\\varphi=\\frac12$ you can find the value of $\\cos\\varphi$ by solving the quadratic equation and taking the positive root. Once you know $\\cos\\varphi$ , you can compute $\\cos2\\varphi$ and many other things. If you try it this way, you can check your result e.g. here .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving two trigonometric identities: cos(π/5) - cos(2π/5) = 0.5 and cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 0.25, both without using a calculator. \n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem mentions proving these equations, so the assumptions should include the specific angles involved. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. \n\nFor the first part, the angles are π/5 and 2π/5. The problem states that these are arguments of the cosine function. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- θ = π/5,\n- θ is an angle in the first quadrant (since π/5 and 2π/5 are both between 0 and π/2),\n- The problem involves the cosine function,\n- The operations are subtraction and multiplication of cosine values.\n\nWait, but the user example only lists assumptions about the variables and their properties. For the example given earlier, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, maybe the angles being π/5 and 2π/5 are the key assumptions. But since the problem is to prove the equations, perhaps the assumptions are the specific values of the angles. But the example didn't list the components of the expression as assumptions, just the conditions on the variable. Hmm. Let me look again.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\nAssumptions:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn that case, the assumptions are about the variable n. For the trigonometric problem, the variables are the angles. But the problem is to prove an equality involving those specific angles. So maybe the assumptions here are that the angles are π/5 and 2π/5. But since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps there are no additional conditions other than the angles themselves. Wait, but in the example, n being an integer and divisible by 7 were the conditions. Here, the problem isn't for all angles but specific ones. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The first angle is π/5,\n- The second angle is 2π/5,\n- The functions involved are cosine,\n- The operations are subtraction and multiplication.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each angle should be listed as a separate assumption. Let me check:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions were two separate conditions on n. Here, the angles are given as specific values. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/5,\nThe second angle is 2π/5.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the two identities are separate. The user mentioned two related questions. So the problem should be split? Or the problem is to prove both identities. The original question includes two parts: prove cos(π/5) - cos(2π/5) = 0.5 and also prove cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 0.25. But the user wants to structure this into one problem? Or two separate problems? The example given combined them into one problem statement. Let me look at the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem had two assumptions about n. So in this case, the two identities are part of the same problem. So perhaps the problem statement includes both. However, the user's example structured the problem as one problem. So here, the problem statement would be to prove both equations. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the angles involved. So each angle is an assumption. However, the problem involves both subtraction and multiplication of cosines. But the example's assumptions were about the variable n. Here, the variables are fixed angles. Maybe the assumptions are about the angles being in radians, but that's standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't have additional assumptions beyond the given angles. Wait, maybe in this case, the problem is purely algebraic/trigonometric, so the assumptions are that the angles π/5 and 2π/5 are used. So each angle is an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no variables, just constants, so the assumptions are the specific angles. But according to the example, assumptions are conditions on the variables. Here, since there are no variables (π/5 and 2π/5 are constants), perhaps there are no assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when it's about a variable. Wait, the example's original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, but the formatted problem changed it to assume n is divisible by 7 and then prove divisibility by 91. Wait, the example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, so the user example actually changed the original problem by adding an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the user example was a mistake. But according to the instructions, the task is to \"filter the unrelated information\" and structure the problem. So perhaps in the original problem, the user added an assumption that wasn't there, but in reality, the formatted problem should list the implicit assumptions.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the example is wrong. But according to the user's example, they took the original problem which stated \"for every integer n\" and in the formatted problem, they listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's adding a new condition. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect. But in any case, following the user's instruction, we need to structure the problem as per their example, which seems to list the variables and their conditions as assumptions.\n\nSo for the trigonometric problem, the original question is to prove the two equalities. The problem involves specific angles, so perhaps the assumptions are that the angles are π/5 and 2π/5. But since those are given in the problem, maybe there are no additional assumptions. However, the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was \"Prove for every integer n...\" and in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless there was a miscommunication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to extract the key conditions from the problem. In the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user made an error. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo and the formatted one is correct. Assuming the user's example is correct, then for the trigonometric problem, perhaps the assumptions are the angles and any conditions on them. But since the angles are specific, maybe there are no assumptions other than their values. But according to the user's example, even if the original problem didn't state it, they added assumptions. So perhaps here, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/5,\nThe second angle is 2π/5,\nThe trigonometric function involved is cosine,\nThe operations are subtraction and multiplication.\n\nBut each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So each angle is an assumption. Then, the problem is to prove both equalities. But the user's example combined two related questions into one problem. So the formatted problem would list both identities as part of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each identity is a separate problem, but the user's example included both. Wait, the original question in the example had a related question mentioned, but the formatted problem included only the first one. Wait, the example's original problem was about A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted problem kept that as the main problem. The related part was omitted. So perhaps here, the formatted problem should include both parts since the original question mentions both. So the problem statement would be to prove both equations.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nAssumptions:\nθ = π/5,\nφ = 2π/5,\nThe problem involves the cosine function,\nThe operations are subtraction and multiplication.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the assumptions were about the variable (n) and its properties. Here, the variables are specific angles, so perhaps the assumptions are just their values. However, since the angles are given, maybe they don't need to be listed as assumptions. But the user's example listed n's properties even though they were given in the problem. So perhaps we need to list them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any variables with conditions beyond what's given, so there are no assumptions. But the user's example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. This is confusing. Perhaps the example was wrong, but I need to follow it.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\" which means n is any integer. But the formatted problem's assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Unless the user intended to change the problem, but that's unclear. Perhaps the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nAssuming the example is correct, then for the trigonometric problem, the assumptions would be the angles and any conditions. But since the angles are specific, perhaps the only assumptions are their values. But how to phrase that.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to prove the equalities, perhaps there are no assumptions beyond the given expressions. But the user's example added assumptions. Maybe the key is to list the objects involved. For instance:\n\nAssumptions:\nThe first term is cos(π/5),\nThe second term is cos(2π/5),\nThe operation between them is subtraction for the first identity,\nThe operation between them is multiplication for the second identity.\n\nBut each assumption should be one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nConsider the angle π/5,\nConsider the angle 2π/5,\nThe function considered is cosine,\nThe operations are subtraction and multiplication.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the confusion, I'll proceed to structure it as follows:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/5,\nThe second angle is 2π/5.\n\nProblem:\nProve that cos(π/5) - cos(2π/5) = 0.5 and cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 0.25 without using a calculator.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption on a separate line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nθ = π/5,\nφ = 2π/5,\nThe trigonometric identity involves cosine,\nThe operations are subtraction and multiplication.\n\nBut maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about angles in radians, but that's standard. Since the example's assumptions were about the variable, here the variables are the angles, so their specific values are part of the problem, not assumptions. Thus, maybe there are no assumptions, but the example forced to list assumptions. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has no assumptions beyond the given terms, and the assumptions section should list the components of the problem. But according to the user's example, the assumptions were conditions on n. So here, since the problem is about specific angles, maybe there are no additional assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed to list the angles as assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/5,\nThe second angle is 2π/5.\n\nProblem:\nProve that cos(π/5) - cos(2π/5) = 0.5 and cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 0.25 without using a calculator.\n\nBut the example had assumptions about the variable's properties. Here, there are no variables; it's about specific angles. So perhaps the problem doesn't have assumptions, but the format requires it. In that case, maybe the assumptions are empty. But the user's example included them. To adhere to the format, perhaps list the angles as assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as involving two separate equations, each with their own assumptions. But the user's example combined them. I think the correct approach is to list the angles involved and the operations, but I'm not entirely sure. However, following the user's example, which listed the variable's conditions, here the assumptions would be the angles used. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe first angle is π/5,\nThe second angle is 2π/5,\nThe trigonometric function is cosine.\n\nProblem:\nProve that cos(π/5) - cos(2π/5) = 0.5 and cos(π/5)cos(2π/5) = 0.25 without using a calculator.\n\nThis seems to fit the format, with each assumption on a separate line. Each line addresses one property (angle value) applied to one object (each angle).",
