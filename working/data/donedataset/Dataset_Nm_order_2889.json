    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to format this problem according to the user's instructions. First, I need to read the original question carefully and identify all the assumptions and the problem statement. The user provided an example, so I can use that as a guide.\n\nThe title of the question is \"How to prove sum of powers property of roots of unity?\" The user is asking about proving a specific case for the sum of powers of roots of unity. The original equation they mention is that the sum 1 + α₁ + α₂ + ... + α_{n-1} equals zero, where α_i are the roots of z^n = 1. Then they want to prove that the sum 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} α_i^m equals 0 when m is an integer not divisible by n, and equals n when m is divisible by n.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let's parse the problem step by step.\n\nThe roots α_i are the roots of z^n = 1. So, each α_i is a root of unity, specifically a primitive nth root or not? Wait, the equation given is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} α_i = 0. Wait, actually, the roots of z^n = 1 are 1, α_1, α_2, ..., α_{n-1}, right? So the sum of all roots is zero, but when we exclude 1, the sum of the remaining roots is -1. Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention that 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} α_i = 0, which makes sense because the sum of all nth roots of unity is zero. So the first assumption is that α_i are the roots of z^n = 1. So that's one assumption. Then, the problem is about the sum of their powers.\n\nThe problem statement has two cases: when m is an integer not congruent to 0 mod n, the sum is 0; when m is congruent to 0 mod n, the sum is n. So, for the assumptions, I need to list all the conditions. Let's see:\n\n- The roots α_i satisfy z^n = 1. So each α_i is a root of the equation z^n = 1.\n- The sum 1 + α_1 + α_2 + ... + α_{n-1} = 0. But actually, that's a consequence of the roots being roots of unity, so maybe that's not an assumption but a given. Wait, but the user mentioned that as a known property. However, in the problem, they want to generalize this to powers m. So perhaps the key assumptions are about m and n.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the cases depend on whether m is an integer not divisible by n or divisible by n. So the assumptions would involve m being an integer and the congruence conditions. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- α_i are the roots of z^n = 1.\n- m is an integer.\n- m is not congruent to 0 modulo n (for the first case).\n- m is congruent to 0 modulo n (for the second case).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user wants to prove the sum equals 0 when m ≢ 0 mod n and n when m ≡ 0 mod n. However, in the problem, the cases are part of the problem's conclusion, not the assumptions. So the assumptions should be the given conditions that apply to the variables. The problem is to prove the sum has those values based on m's congruence modulo n.\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n- α_i are the roots of z^n = 1.\n- m is an integer.\n\nBut the problem is split into two cases based on m's divisibility by n. However, in the example provided by the user, the assumption included \"n is divisible by 7,\" which was part of the problem's conditions. But in this case, the problem isn't assuming m's divisibility; rather, the problem is to show that depending on whether m is divisible by n, the sum is 0 or n. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- α_i are roots of the equation z^n = 1.\n- m is an integer.\n\nThe problem then is to prove that the sum 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} α_i^m equals 0 or n depending on m's congruence modulo n. So the problem statement would be as given, and the assumptions are just the roots being nth roots of unity and m being an integer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem statement, the user already knows that the sum of all roots (including 1) is zero, which is a standard property. So perhaps the only assumption needed is that α_i are the roots of z^n = 1, and m is an integer. The rest is part of the problem to prove.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n- α_i are the roots of z^n = 1,\n- m is an integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that\n$$1+\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\alpha_i^m=\\begin{cases}0 & \\text{if } m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}, \\\\ n & \\text{if } m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}. \\end{cases}$$\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, the assumption included a divisibility condition (n is divisible by 7). However, in this problem, the divisibility is part of the cases in the problem statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the assumptions here are just that α_i are roots of z^n = 1 and m is an integer. The rest is what needs to be proven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has m being any integer, so the assumptions are that m is an integer and α_i are roots of z^n =1.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the two assumptions are:\n\n1. α_i are the roots of z^n = 1.\n2. m is an integer.\n\nThe problem is to prove the sum equals 0 or n based on m mod n.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have those assumptions and the problem statement as above.",
