    "AcceptedAnswer": "Performine the change of variables: $z = e^{ix}$, then , $x =\\frac{1}{i}\\log(z)$. The integral takes the form: $ I = \\Re \\int_{|z|=1 \\arg(z)=0}^{|z|=1 \\arg(z)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\log \\big(-(\\log(z))^2 +(\\log(\\frac{z^2+1}{2z}))^2\\big ) \\frac{dz}{iz} $ The real part is added, since the logarithm of the cosine is singular at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and can pick up an imaginary part. Expressing the difference of squares as a product we obtain: $  = \\Re\\int_{|z|=1 \\arg(z)=0}^{|z|=1\\arg(z)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\big ( (\\log(\\log(\\frac{z^2+1}{2})) + (\\log(\\log(\\frac{z^{-2}+1}{2})) \\frac{dz}{iz}$. The second part of the integral can be brought to the form of the first part by the transformation  $z\\rightarrow z^{-1}$ , thus $  I = \\Re\\int_{|z|=1 \\arg(z)=0}^{|z|=1\\arg(z)=\\pi}\\big ( (\\log(\\log(\\frac{z^2+1}{2})) \\frac{dz}{iz}$. The integrand is invariant under the transformation $z\\rightarrow -z$, thus:\n$  I = \\Re\\frac{1}{2}\\oint_{|z|=1 } \\big ( (\\log(\\log(\\frac{z^2+1}{2})) \\frac{dz}{iz}$. The numerator has no poles in the unit disc, thus using the residue theorem: $I = \\Re \\frac{2\\pi i}{2 i}\\log(\\log(-2)) = \\pi \\log(\\log(2))$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this integral problem. The user wants me to structure the problem according to the given format. The original question is about proving that the integral from 0 to π/2 of log(x² + log²(cos x)) dx equals π log(log 2). \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem mentions the integral over the interval [0, π/2], so the limits are from 0 to π/2. The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)). The result is supposed to be π times log(log 2). \n\nI should check if there are any implicit assumptions. The problem states that the integral equals π log(log 2), which probably assumes that the integral converges. Also, the logarithm function log here is typically natural logarithm unless specified otherwise, but maybe that's an assumption. However, since the result uses log(2), which in natural logarithm is ln(2), but the problem uses \"log\" notation. It's possible that in the context, log is natural log, but sometimes in math problems, especially integrals, that's the case. However, the user's example used \"log\" as well, so maybe we don't need to specify unless it's base 10. So maybe the assumption is that log is the natural logarithm.\n\nAdditionally, the integrand involves log(cos x), so cos x must be positive in the interval [0, π/2], which it is. Also, the argument inside the logarithm, x² + log²(cos x), must be positive. Since x is in [0, π/2], x² is non-negative, and log(cos x) is real because cos x is between 0 and 1, so log(cos x) is negative or zero (at x=0, cos 0=1, log 1=0). Therefore, log²(cos x) is non-negative, so x² + log²(cos x) is non-negative. At x=0, it's 0 + (log 1)^2 = 0, but log(0) is undefined. Wait, but at x=0, the integrand becomes log(0 + 0) which is log(0), which is negative infinity. However, the integral might still converge if the singularity is integrable. So perhaps we need to check if the integral converges at x=0. Let's see: near x=0, cos x ≈ 1 - x²/2, so log(cos x) ≈ -x²/2 - (x^4)/12 etc. So log(cos x) ≈ -x²/2. Then log²(cos x) ≈ x^4/4. Then x² + log²(cos x) ≈ x² + x^4/4. So the argument of the log is approximately x². So log(x²) = 2 log |x| ≈ 2 log x. Near x=0, log x tends to -infty, but the integrand becomes log(x² + log²(cos x)) ≈ log(x² + x^4/4) ≈ log(x²(1 + x²/4)) ≈ log x² + log(1 + x²/4) ≈ 2 log x + x²/4. So the integrand behaves like 2 log x near x=0. The integral of log x from 0 to some point is convergent because the integral of log x dx is x log x - x, which tends to 0 as x approaches 0. So the integral is convergent. So the problem assumes that the integral is convergent. But maybe that's part of what needs to be proven? However, the user's example didn't list convergence as an assumption; they just listed the conditions on the variables. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are mainly about the domain and the functions involved.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm (if that's an assumption here).\n- The integral converges (if necessary). But maybe the problem just states the integral and the result, so the main assumptions are the limits of integration and the integrand. The problem doesn't mention any other conditions, so perhaps the only assumption is the integral setup.\n\nWait, in the example provided, the user structured the problem by listing the assumptions as \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user was supposed to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, it's listed as assumptions. Wait, perhaps in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they restricted to n divisible by 7? Wait, looking back:\n\nOriginal problem example: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, or perhaps they had a different intention. But perhaps in the actual task, the user wants to extract the assumptions as given in the problem, not to add new ones. Wait, the original instruction says: \"filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\" So maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake or required n to be divisible by 7, but the user rephrased it. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the example's original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So that seems contradictory. Unless there was a miscommunication. Perhaps the original problem had a different condition, but in the example, it's presented differently. Maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, following the user's instruction, when structuring the problem, we need to list all the assumptions. \n\nBut in the integral problem given, the integral is from 0 to π/2, and the integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)). The problem is to prove that this integral equals π log(log 2). So the assumptions here would be:\n\n- The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n- The logarithm is the natural logarithm (since the result involves log(log 2), which is commonly natural log).\n- The integral converges (though this might be considered part of the problem rather than an assumption).\n\nBut according to the example, perhaps only the explicit conditions given in the problem are listed as assumptions. The original problem states the integral and the result, so the assumptions would be:\n\n- Integration variable x ranges from 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n- The logarithm function is natural logarithm (if that's not specified, but since the result uses log(log 2), which in natural log is ln(ln 2), but perhaps in some contexts log is base 10. However, in higher mathematics, log is usually natural log. So this is an assumption unless specified.)\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the base of the logarithm. That's a potential ambiguity. However, given that the result is π log(log 2), if log were base 10, then log(log 2) would be log10(log10 2), which is a negative number because log10 2 ≈ 0.3010, and log10(0.3010) ≈ -0.521. Then π times that would be negative, but the integral of a log function here... Wait, the integrand log(x² + log²(cos x)) would have x² + log²(cos x) ≥0, so the log could be negative if x² + log²(cos x) <1. For example, at x=0, x² + log²(cos x) =0 + (log 1)^2=0, so log(0) is undefined. Wait, but the integral is from 0 to π/2, and near x=0, as we discussed earlier, the integrand approaches log(0), which is -infinity. But the integral might still converge. However, the result given is π log(log 2), which if log is natural log, then log(log 2) is ln(ln 2) ≈ ln(-0.693) which is undefined. Wait, hold on, ln(2) is approximately 0.693, so ln(ln 2) would be ln(0.693) ≈ -0.366, which is a real number. Wait, yes, ln(2) is positive, so ln(ln 2) is negative but real. So π times that would be negative. But the integral of log(...) from 0 to π/2 is negative? Let's see. The integrand log(x² + log²(cos x)) is log of something that is between 0 and ... let's see. For x in [0, π/2], cos x is between 0 and 1, so log(cos x) is negative or zero. Therefore, log²(cos x) is positive or zero. x² is positive or zero. So x² + log²(cos x) is positive or zero. At x=0, it's 0 + (log 1)^2 =0, so log(0) which is -infty. At x approaching π/2, cos x approaches 0, so log(cos x) approaches -infty, hence log²(cos x) approaches +infty. So x² + log²(cos x) approaches +infty, so log(that) approaches log(infty) which is +infty. Wait, but near x=π/2, cos x approaches 0, so log(cos x) approaches -infty, hence log²(cos x) is +infty. So x² is finite (since x is up to π/2 ≈1.57), so x² + log²(cos x) is +infty, so log of that is +infty. So the integrand tends to +infty as x approaches π/2. Therefore, the integral has two singularities: at x=0 (integrand approaches -infty) and at x=π/2 (integrand approaches +infty). The question is whether the integral converges. But according to the problem statement, the result is π log(log 2), which is a finite number (negative). So the integral must converge. Therefore, the problem assumes that the integral converges, but this is part of the problem's conditions. So perhaps the assumptions are just the integral's limits and the integrand. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The integral is computed over the interval [0, π/2].\n- The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n- The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the base of the logarithm, but the result uses log(log 2), which in natural log is valid (as ln(ln 2) is a real number), but if it were base 10, log(log 2) would be log10(log10 2) ≈ log10(0.3010) ≈ -0.521, which is also a real number. However, in mathematical analysis, log without a base usually denotes natural logarithm. So that's a safe assumption.\n\nAnother point: The problem states that the result agrees numerically. So the user probably verified it numerically, confirming that the integral equals π log(log 2). So the assumptions are as above.\n\nSo, structuring the problem according to the format:\n\nAssumption: The integral is taken over the interval [0, π/2].\n\nAssumption: The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n\nAssumption: The logarithm function is the natural logarithm.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\log \\left( x^2+\\log^2(\\cos x)\\right)dx = \\pi \\log \\left(\\log (2) \\right)$$\n\nBut wait, in the example given by the user, they listed the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. In the original example:\n\nAssumption: $n$ is an integer,\n\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in the integral problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The variable of integration is $x$ over the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\n\nAssumption: The integrand is $\\log(x^2 + \\log^2(\\cos x))$.\n\nBut perhaps more precise:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated from $0$ to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAssumption: The integrand function is $\\log(x^2 + (\\log(\\cos x))^2)$.\n\nAssumption: Logarithms are natural logarithms.\n\nBut maybe the last one is implicit. However, since the problem uses \"log\" notation, and the result has $\\log(\\log 2)$, it's crucial to specify that log is natural. Alternatively, if the problem had base 10, the result would be different, but since it's given as π log(log 2), assuming natural log is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require specifying the logarithm base as an assumption because it's part of the problem statement. However, since the example structured by the user included assumptions that were in the problem, perhaps here the integral's limits and the integrand are the main assumptions.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was about divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. This seems incorrect unless there was a mistake. But maybe the user intended to filter unrelated information. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had additional conditions, but the user restructured it. But in the given example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is conflicting. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Regardless, we need to follow the instruction: \"filter the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format.\"\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about proving the integral equals π log(log 2). The problem mentions integrating from 0 to π/2, the integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)), and the result. There's no other condition or parameter, so the assumptions are:\n\n- Integration bounds are 0 to π/2.\n- The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n- The logarithm is natural (since otherwise the result would need to specify the base).\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions, each on a separate line, and then the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption addresses only one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The integral is evaluated from 0 to π/2.\n\nAssumption: The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\log \\left( x^2+\\log^2(\\cos x)\\right)dx = \\pi \\log \\left(\\log (2) \\right)$$\n\nWait, but the logarithm base isn't specified in the problem. However, in mathematics, log without a base is often natural log, but in some contexts, especially engineering, it might be base 10. But given that the result is π log(log 2), which makes sense with natural logarithms (since ln(2) is about 0.693, and ln(ln 2) is about -0.366), the integral would be negative, which is possible if the integrand is negative over part of the interval. However, given the integrand includes log(x² + log²(cos x)), which for x near 0 is log(0) = -infty and near π/2 is log(inf) = inf. So the integral combines regions where the integrand is negative and positive. But numerically, according to the user, it agrees. So the assumption about the logarithm being natural is critical here. But since the problem uses \"log\" without specifying, maybe we should include that as an assumption.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: The integral is computed over the interval [0, π/2].\n\nAssumption: The integrand is log(x² + log²(cos x)).\n\nAssumption: All instances of log denote the natural logarithm.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\log \\left( x^2+\\log^2(\\cos x)\\right)dx = \\pi \\log \\left(\\log (2) \\right)$$\n\nYes, that seems correct.
