    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to structure this problem based on the example provided. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions from the problem. The original question is about proving a trigonometric identity: cot(7.5°) equals the sum of several square roots. The user mentioned using half-angle formulas and getting a specific expression but not knowing how to equate it to the given surds. \n\nLooking at the problem, the key elements are the angle (7.5 degrees), the cotangent function, and the sum of square roots. The assumptions here would be related to the angle being 7.5 degrees and the trigonometric identity involving cotangent. The problem is to prove that the cotangent of this specific angle equals the sum of those square roots. \n\nWait, in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this trigonometric problem, are there any implicit assumptions? The problem is a pure identity, so maybe the main assumption is the angle given. However, the example had two assumptions, one about n being an integer and another about divisibility. Here, perhaps the only assumption is that the angle is 7.5 degrees. But the user hasn't mentioned any additional constraints. Wait, the original problem is just stating the identity to prove. So maybe the assumption is just the angle, but the example included more because the original problem had conditions on n. Hmm, maybe in this case, the assumption is that 7.5 degrees is half of 15 degrees, which is derived from the half-angle formula. But the user hasn't specified that; they just used half-angle formulas. So maybe the assumption is that 7.5 degrees is the half-angle of 15 degrees. However, in the example, the assumptions were properties of the variable in the problem. Here, since it's a specific angle, perhaps there's only one assumption related to the angle's measure. But the example had two assumptions, but in this problem, there's only one. So perhaps the assumption is simply that the angle is 7.5 degrees. Wait, but in the example, the assumptions were about n being integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is to prove an identity for a specific angle, so maybe there's no variable. Therefore, the assumption is just that the angle is 7.5 degrees. But maybe also that trigonometric identities for half-angles apply? Or is that part of the problem? The problem is to prove the identity using those techniques. The user's attempt used half-angle formulas. So maybe the assumption is that the half-angle formulas are applicable here, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions beyond the angle given, but the example had assumptions even for an identity. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem had assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking back, the example says the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in the example. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists assumptions that n is an integer (which is given) and n is divisible by 7. But that would change the problem. So maybe the example was incorrect. But since the user provided it, perhaps the task is to extract the assumptions from the problem as presented, even if they are redundant. Wait, perhaps in the original problem, the user made a mistake in formatting. So maybe in that example, the problem was actually to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 when n is divisible by 7, but the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a discrepancy. But regardless, following the user's example, when formatting, the assumptions are listed as separate points, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is to prove that cot(7.5°) equals sqrt2 + sqrt3 + sqrt4 + sqrt6. The user tried using half-angle formulas and arrived at a certain expression but couldn't simplify it to the surd sum. The problem is to prove this identity. So the assumptions here would be:\n\n1. The angle is 7.5 degrees.\n2. The half-angle formulas are applicable. But maybe that's part of the problem-solving method, not an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is an identity, the main assumption is that the angle is 7.5 degrees. So the formatted assumption would be \"7.5° is the angle for which the cotangent is being calculated.\" But perhaps more accurately, since the problem is to prove the identity, the assumption is just the angle's measure. So the assumption line would be: \"The angle is 7.5 degrees.\" Then the problem is to prove that the cotangent of this angle equals the sum of the square roots.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but regardless, following the example, the current problem should have assumptions listed. But in this case, there are no variables; it's a specific identity. So maybe the assumption is just the angle's value. Or perhaps there's another assumption related to the trigonometric identities used. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the given angle, but the example required listing assumptions even if they're part of the problem statement. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was converted into an assumption \"n is an integer\" and added \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems incorrect. So perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants to structure the problem by extracting the conditions. However, in the current problem, the problem is just an identity, so the only assumption is the angle. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: The angle is 7.5 degrees.\n\nProblem: Prove that cot(7.5°) equals √2 + √3 + √4 + √6.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions even though the original problem only mentioned one condition. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, it's stated with an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems to change the problem. So perhaps the user intended to modify the problem's conditions. But in the current case, the problem is an identity, so there's only one assumption. However, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the original problem from the user.\n\nOriginal problem on Math Stack Exchange:\nTitle: Prove that: $ \\cot7\\frac12 ^\\circ = \\sqrt2 + \\sqrt3 + \\sqrt4 + \\sqrt6$\nQuestion: How to prove the following trigonometric identity?\n$$ \\cot7\\frac12 ^\\circ = \\sqrt2 + \\sqrt3 + \\sqrt4 + \\sqrt6$$\nUsing half angle formulas, I am getting a number for $\\cot7\\frac12 ^\\circ $, but I don't know how to show it to equal the number $\\sqrt2 + \\sqrt3 + \\sqrt4 + \\sqrt6$. I would however like to learn the technique of dealing with surds such as these, especially in trigonometric problems as I have a lot of similar problems and I don't have a clue as to how to deal with those. Hints please! EDIT : What I have done using half angles is this: (and please note, for convenience, I am dropping the degree symbols. The angles here are in degrees however). I know that\n$$ \\cos 15 = \\dfrac{\\sqrt3+1}{2\\sqrt2}$$ So, $$\\sin7.5 = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-\\cos 15} {2}}$$\n$$\\cos7.5 = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1+\\cos 15} {2}} $$ $$\\implies \\cot 7.5 = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2\\sqrt2 + \\sqrt3 + 1} {2\\sqrt2 - \\sqrt3 + 1}} $$\n\nSo the user is trying to prove the identity for cot(7.5°). The problem is to prove this identity. The user used half-angle formulas starting from cos(15°), then derived expressions for sin(7.5°), cos(7.5°), and then cot(7.5°) as a square root of a fraction. Now, to structure this, the assumption would be the angle of 7.5 degrees, and the problem is to prove the equality. But since the example had multiple assumptions, maybe here we can list:\n\nAssumption:\nThe angle is 7.5 degrees,\nHalf-angle formulas are applicable.\n\nBut wait, the example didn't include the method as an assumption. The example's assumptions were about the variable's properties. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is the angle. The problem is to prove the identity. Therefore, following the example's structure, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The angle is 7.5 degrees.\nProblem: Prove that $\\cot7\\frac12^\\circ = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nBut wait, the example added an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect. But given that, perhaps the task is to extract any implicit assumptions. In the trigonometric identity, the main assumption is the angle, but maybe also that we are working in degrees, not radians. However, the problem specifies degrees. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The angle is 7.5 degrees,\nAll trigonometric functions are evaluated in degrees.\n\nBut the example didn't mention units, but in the example, the problem was in integers. So perhaps for this problem, the key assumption is the angle measure. Since the problem states 7.5 degrees, and in the user's edit, they mention dropping the degree symbols but note that angles are in degrees. So maybe the assumption is that the angle is in degrees. Therefore, two assumptions:\n\n1. The angle is 7.5 degrees.\n2. The angle is measured in degrees.\n\nBut I think the second is redundant since the problem specifies degrees. However, to match the example where assumptions are listed line by line, maybe both are needed. Alternatively, perhaps only one assumption: the angle is 7.5 degrees. Because the problem explicitly mentions degrees, so the unit is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: The angle is 7.5 degrees.\nProblem: Prove that $\\cot7\\frac12^\\circ = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that changes the problem's scope. The original problem was for all integers, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless the example was from a different problem where the user intended to modify the original. Anyway, perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions mentioned in the problem. In the current problem, the only condition is the angle, so one assumption. Therefore, proceeding with that.",
