    "Content": "How one can prove that for a matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and singular values $\\sigma_i$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$, the following inequality holds: $$ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i(A) \\geq\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left |\\lambda_i(A) \\right |$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Due to Schur decomposition , there exist a unitary matrix $U$ and an upper triangular matrix $T$, such that $A=UTU^{-1}$. Note that $A$ and $T$ share the same eigenvalues and singular values, so we may assume that $A$ is upper triangular. Now let $A$ be upper triangular, so the diagonal of $A$ consists of eigenvalues of $A$, and we may assume  the $(i,i)$ entry of $A$ is $\\lambda_i(A)$.  For $1\\le i\\le n$, let $\\lambda_i(A)=|\\lambda_i(A)|\\alpha_i$, where $|\\alpha_i|=1$. Denote $D=\\mathrm{diag}(\\alpha_1,\\dots, \\alpha_n)$ and let $B=D^{-1}A$. Since $D$ is unitary, $B$ and $A$ share the same singular values. Moreover, by the choice of $D$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{tr} B=\\sum_{i=1}^n|\\lambda_i(A)|.\\tag{1}$$ Let $B=U\\Sigma V$ be the singular value decomposition of $B$, i.e. $U$ and $V$ are unitary, and $\\Sigma=\\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_1(A),\\dots, \\sigma_n(A))$. Then\n$$\\mathrm{tr} B=\\mathrm{tr}(U\\Sigma V)=\\mathrm{tr}(\\Sigma VU)=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A)c_{ii},\\tag{2}$$\nwhere $c_{ii}$ is the $(i,i)$ entry of $VU$. Since $VU$ is unitary, $|c_{ii}|\\le 1$ for $1\\le i\\le n$. Then from $(2)$ we know that\n$$|\\mathrm{tr} B|\\le \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A)|c_{ii}|\\le \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A).\\tag{3}$$ The conclusion follows from $(1)$ and $(3)$. Remark: Denote the collection of $n\\times n$ unitary matrix by $U_n$. From the argument above it is easy to see that for every $n\\times n$ matrix $A$, we have: (i) there exist $U_0,V_0\\in U_n$, such that\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n|\\lambda_i(A)|=\\mathrm{tr} (U_0AV_0);$$\nand (ii)\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_i(A)=\\sup_{U,V\\in U_n}|\\mathrm{tr} (UAV)|.$$\nThe conclusion is implied by facts (i) and (ii) immediately.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let me start by reading the original question carefully. The user is asking about proving an inequality involving the sum of singular values and the sum of the absolute values of eigenvalues for a complex matrix. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The original problem mentions a matrix A in C^(n×n), eigenvalues λ_i, and singular values σ_i for i from 1 to n. The question is about proving that the sum of singular values is greater than or equal to the sum of the absolute eigenvalues.\n\nLooking at the example provided, each assumption is listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the matrix A is the main object. \n\nSo, the assumptions here are:\n1. A is a matrix in C^(n×n} (complex n by n matrices).\n2. The eigenvalues of A are λ_i for i from 1 to n.\n3. The singular values of A are σ_i for i from 1 to n.\n\nEach of these points is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove the inequality given these conditions. I should check if there are any other implicit assumptions. The original question doesn't specify any additional constraints like the matrix being normal, diagonalizable, etc., so I shouldn't add those. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these three assumptions, each on their own line, and then state the problem as proving the inequality sum σ_i >= sum |λ_i|. Let me make sure there are no other hidden conditions. The user hasn't mentioned anything else, so the assumptions are straightforward. \n\nWait, in the example, they included two assumptions about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the matrix's properties are all covered by stating it's in C^(n×n), and then the existence of eigenvalues and singular values. Since eigenvalues exist for any complex matrix (as per the fundamental theorem of algebra), and singular values are always defined for complex matrices via the SVD, so those are valid assumptions. \n\nSo, the assumptions are correctly captured. Therefore, the formatted problem should be as follows.",
