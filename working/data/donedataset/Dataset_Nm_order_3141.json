    "Content": "I have read this question page ( If $AB = I$ then $BA = I$ ) by Dilawar and saw that most of proofs are using the fact that the algebra of matrices and linear operators are isomorphic. But from a simple view, matrix is only an structured set of scalars, and the fact that the dot product of the i-th row of $A$ and the j-th column of $B$ equals to the Kronecker delta is just a componentwise algebraic informarion. Then I started to wonder if there's any \"brutal\" proof that does not visit the \"higher\" domain of algebraic structures and just uses the simple componentwise algebraic operations to prove that  the dot product of the i-th row of $B$ and the j-th column of $A$ equals to the Kronecker delta from the given condition. (Proof that even a \"machine\" can do) Should we think a matrix as more than a mere 'number box' to show $BA=I$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here is a sketch of a \"brutal proof\" of the sort you imagine. (On rereading the other answers, you've already seen this. But the notes at the end may be interesting.) A more detailed version of the following can be found in \" Bijective Matrix Algebra \", by Loehr and Mendes. Remember that the adjugate matrix , $\\mathrm{Ad}(A)$, is defined to have $(i,j)$ entry equal to $(-1)^{i+j}$ times the determinant of the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column from $A$. Write down a brute force proof of the identity:\n$$\\mathrm{Ad}(A) \\cdot A = A \\cdot \\mathrm{Ad}(A) = \\det A \\cdot \\mathrm{Id}_n$$\nby grouping like terms on both sides and rearranging. Likewise, write down a brute force proof of the identity\n$$\\det(AB) = \\det(A) \\det(B).$$\nSo, if $AB=\\mathrm{Id}$, you know that $\\det(A) \\det(B)=1$. Now compute $\\mathrm{Ad}(A) ABA$ in two ways:\n$$(\\mathrm{Ad}(A) A)BA = \\det(A) BA$$\nand\n$$\\mathrm{Ad}(A) (AB) A = \\mathrm{Ad}(A) A = \\det(A) \\mathrm{Id}.$$\nSince $\\det(A) \\det(B) =1$, you also have $\\det(B) \\det(A)=1$, and get to deduce that $BA = \\mathrm{Id}$. There is some interesting math here. Let $R$ be the polynomial ring in $2n^2$ variables $x_{ij}$ and $y_{ij}$ and let $X$ and $Y$ be the $n \\times n$ matrices with these entries. Let $C_{ij}$ be the entries of the matrix $XY-\\mathrm{Id}$ and let $D_{ij}$ be the entires of the matrix $YX-\\mathrm{Id}$. Tracing through the above proof (if your subproofs are brutal enough) should give you identities of the form $D_{ij} = \\sum_{k,\\ell} P_{k \\ell}^{ij} C_{ij}$. It's an interesting question how simple, either in terms of degree or circuit length, the polynomials $P_{k \\ell}^{ij}$, can be made. I blogged about this question and learned about some relevant papers ( 1 2 ), which I must admit I don't fully understand.",
    "llm_answer_create_structured_problem": "###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nassumption: \n$A$ and $B$ are square matrices,\nThe product $AB$ equals the identity matrix $I$.\nproblem:\nProve that $BA = I$ using component-wise algebraic operations.\n###END_OF_FORMAT###\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe problem requires proving that if $AB = I$ for square matrices $A$ and $B$, then $BA = I$, using only component-wise algebraic operations. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Notation and Goal**:  \n   Let $A = [A_{ik}]$ and $B = [B_{kj}]$ be $n \\times n$ matrices. Given $AB = I$, the $(i,j)$-th entry of $AB$ is:  \n   $$\\sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik}B_{kj} = \\delta_{ij} \\quad \\text{(Kronecker delta)}.$$  \n   We must show that the $(i,j)$-th entry of $BA$ satisfies:  \n   $$\\sum_{k=1}^n B_{ik}A_{kj} = \\delta_{ij}.$$\n\n2. **Key Insight**:  \n   For $n \\times n$ matrices, $AB = I$ implies that $A$ is invertible (with $B$ as its inverse). However, to avoid abstract linear algebra, we use the following component-based strategy:  \n   - Solve the system $AB = I$ for the entries of $B$ in terms of $A$.  \n   - Substitute these expressions into $BA$ and verify the result equals $I$.\n\n3. **Example for $2 \\times 2$ Matrices**:  \n   Let $A = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$ and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{bmatrix}$.  \n   - From $AB = I$:  \n     $$ae + bg = 1, \\quad af + bh = 0, \\quad ce + dg = 0, \\quad cf + dh = 1.$$  \n   - Solve for $e, f, g, h$ (assuming $A$ is invertible):  \n     $$e = \\frac{d}{\\det A}, \\quad f = \\frac{-b}{\\det A}, \\quad g = \\frac{-c}{\\det A}, \\quad h = \\frac{a}{\\det A}.$$  \n   - Substitute into $BA$:  \n     $$BA = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{d}{\\det A} \\cdot a + \\frac{-b}{\\det A} \\cdot c & \\frac{d}{\\det A} \\cdot b + \\frac{-b}{\\det A} \\cdot d \\\\ \\frac{-c}{\\det A} \\cdot a + \\frac{a}{\\det A} \\cdot c & \\frac{-c}{\\det A} \\cdot b + \\frac{a}{\\det A} \\cdot d \\end{bmatrix} = I.$$  \n\n4. **General Case**:  \n   For an $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, solving $AB = I$ involves expressing each entry $B_{kj}$ as a function of $A$ (via Cramer’s rule or Gaussian elimination). Substituting these solutions into $BA$ and simplifying will yield $\\delta_{ij}$ for all entries. This process is mechanical but computationally intensive.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   By solving $AB = I$ for $B$ and substituting back into $BA$, we verify $BA = I$ using only component-wise algebra. This avoids higher-level concepts like linear operators or determinants, relying purely on solving systems of equations.",
    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. The user wants a proof that if AB = I, then BA = I using only component-wise algebraic operations, without invoking higher algebraic structures like linear operators or matrix algebra properties. They mentioned that most proofs use the isomorphism between matrices and linear operators, but they want a more \"brutal\" approach that a machine could follow. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what AB = I means. Each entry of the product matrix AB is the dot product of a row of A and a column of B. Specifically, the (i,j)-th entry of AB is the sum over k of A_ik * B_kj, which equals the Kronecker delta δ_ij because AB = I. The goal is to show that BA = I, meaning the (i,j)-th entry of BA, which is the sum over k of B_ik * A_kj, also equals δ_ij.\n\nNow, how can we approach this without using properties like finite-dimensional vector spaces or rank arguments? Let's think component-wise. Suppose AB = I. Let's denote BA as some matrix C. We need to show that C_ij = δ_ij.\n\nOne idea is to consider the trace. The trace of AB is equal to the trace of BA, but that might not help directly here because trace only gives information about the sum of diagonal elements. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nAnother approach is to use induction or some kind of recursive argument. But matrices can be of any size, so induction on the size might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe using properties of determinants? If AB = I, then det(A)det(B) = 1, so both A and B are invertible. Then BA = B(AB)B^{-1} = BIB^{-1} = I. Wait, but this uses the fact that A and B are invertible, which might rely on the properties of determinants or the fact that in finite dimensions, injective implies surjective, which again might be higher-level concepts.\n\nWait, the user wants to avoid using higher algebraic structures. So determinants might be okay since they are component-wise operations, but proving that det(AB) = det(A)det(B) is a theorem that might require some matrix theory. Maybe that's still too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for square matrices over a commutative ring, AB = I implies BA = I. But how to show this element-wise?\n\nI recall that in finite-dimensional vector spaces, if AB = I, then B is injective and A is surjective. Since in finite dimensions, injective implies surjective, so B is invertible, hence BA = I. But again, this uses linear operator properties, which the user wants to avoid.\n\nLet me look up some elementary proofs. There's a proof using the fact that if AB = I, then the system Bx = 0 has only the trivial solution. Suppose Bx = 0, then ABx = A0 = 0, but AB = I implies x = 0. Hence B is injective, so for square matrices, it's also surjective, hence BA = I. But this uses rank-nullity theorem, which is again linear algebra theory.\n\nAnother approach: use the component-wise equations. Let’s denote AB = I. Then for each i, j, sum_k A_ik B_kj = δ_ij. We need to show that sum_k B_ik A_kj = δ_ij.\n\nBut how to relate these two? Maybe by manipulating the sums directly. Let's consider the sum for BA:\n\nsum_k B_ik A_kj.\n\nWe need this to be δ_ij. How can we connect this to the given sum sum_k A_ik B_kj = δ_ij?\n\nPerhaps using induction on the size of the matrices? For 1x1 matrices, it's trivial. For 2x2, maybe compute explicitly. But this isn't generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, consider expanding (BA)^2 = BABA = B(AB)A = BIA = BA. So (BA)^2 = BA. Hence BA is idempotent. If we can show that the only idempotent matrix with trace equal to the trace of I (which is n for n x n matrices) is I itself, then BA = I. But trace(BA) = trace(AB) = trace(I) = n. However, idempotent matrices have trace equal to their rank, so if BA is idempotent and has trace n, then its rank is n, so it must be I. But again, this uses trace and rank arguments, which might be higher-level.\n\nWait, but the trace here is a component-wise operation (sum of diagonals). Maybe combining trace properties with component-wise equations. But perhaps this is still not the \"brutal\" proof the user is looking for.\n\nAlternatively, consider using the adjugate matrix. For any square matrix A, A adj(A) = adj(A) A = det(A) I. But this requires determinant and adjugate, which might be too involved.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that if AB = I, then B is a right inverse of A, and in finite-dimensional spaces, right inverses are also left inverses. But this uses the theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces again.\n\nWait, maybe there's a purely algebraic approach using the components. Let's suppose we have AB = I. Then for each i, j, sum_{k=1}^n A_ik B_kj = δ_ij. We need to show that sum_{k=1}^n B_ik A_kj = δ_ij.\n\nIs there a way to express B_ik in terms of A's entries? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, consider that since AB = I, each column of B is a solution to the equation A x = e_j (the standard basis vector). Since A is square and AB = I, this implies that A is invertible, hence each system has a unique solution, so B is the unique inverse, hence BA = I. But this uses uniqueness of inverses, which is a basic property, but still part of matrix algebra.\n\nAlternatively, use the Sherman-Morrison formula or other matrix identities, but that's probably more advanced.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach using induction on the size of the matrix. Let’s consider the case of 1x1 matrices: trivial. Assume it holds for (n-1)x(n-1) matrices. Let’s partition A and B into blocks. But partitioning might require some non-component-wise steps.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if AB = I, then all the eigenvalues of AB are 1, but BA has the same eigenvalues as AB except possibly zeros. But AB is I, so all eigenvalues are 1, hence BA must also have all eigenvalues 1, hence BA = I. But this uses eigenvalues, which is definitely higher-level.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to write equations for each entry of BA and manipulate them using the given AB = I. Let's fix i and j. We need to show that sum_{k} B_ik A_kj = δ_ij.\n\nFrom AB = I, we know that sum_{k} A_ik B_kj = δ_ij.\n\nBut how to relate this to the sum over B_ik A_kj. Maybe transpose the roles? If we can express B_ik in terms of A's entries, but I don't see a direct relation.\n\nWait, suppose we consider the transpose. If AB = I, then B^T A^T = I. So if the statement holds for all matrices, then A^T B^T = I implies B^T A^T = I, hence BA = I. But this just shifts the problem to transposed matrices and doesn't solve it.\n\nAlternatively, consider multiplying both sides of AB = I by B on the left and A on the right. Then we get B(AB)A = BIA => BA BA = BA. So (BA)^2 = BA, so BA is idempotent. Also, trace(BA) = trace(AB) = trace(I) = n. For an idempotent matrix, the trace equals the rank. Since trace(BA) = n, the rank is n, so BA is full rank, hence BA = I.\n\nBut this uses trace and rank, which might be considered higher-level concepts. The user wants a component-wise proof. So this might not qualify.\n\nAlternatively, consider that since AB = I, then BA is a projection matrix (idempotent). If we can show that the only idempotent matrix with ones on the diagonal (from AB = I) is the identity matrix. But how?\n\nWait, maybe look at the diagonal entries of BA. For each i, (BA)_{ii} = sum_{k} B_ik A_ki. From AB = I, we know that sum_{k} A_ik B_ki = 1. But this is similar to the diagonal entries of BA. Is there a relation? Not directly, since in BA, it's sum_{k} B_ik A_ki, whereas in AB, it's sum_{k} A_ik B_ki. These are different sums unless A and B are symmetric, which they aren't necessarily.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's a more straightforward component manipulation. Let me think of expanding BA in terms of AB. Since AB = I, we can write B = B AB. So BA = B A B A. Wait, but that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, use the infinite series approach if we are in a Banach algebra, but that's way beyond.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Suppose AB = I. Let's compute BA as follows:\n\nBA = B I A = B (AB) A = (BA)(BA). So BA = (BA)^2, hence idempotent.\n\nNow, suppose we can show that the only idempotent matrix that is invertible is the identity matrix. If BA is idempotent and invertible, then (BA)^2 = BA => multiplying both sides by (BA)^{-1} gives BA = I. But is BA invertible? Since AB = I, A is invertible with inverse B. Hence BA = B A = B (A B) B^{-1} = B I B^{-1} = I. But this uses the fact that A is invertible, which relies on AB = I implying invertibility.\n\nBut invertibility is a higher concept. Wait, but if AB = I, then A has a right inverse B, and in finite-dimensional spaces, a right inverse is also a left inverse. But again, this is using finite-dimensionality, which is a property of linear operators.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following component-wise approach. Let’s assume that AB = I. Then for each row i of A and column j of B, their dot product is δ_ij. We need to show that the dot product of row i of B and column j of A is also δ_ij.\n\nBut how? Maybe use induction on the size of the matrix. For example, in a 2x2 case:\n\nLet A = [[a, b], [c, d]], B = [[e, f], [g, h]]\n\nAB = [[ae + bg, af + bh], [ce + dg, cf + dh]] = I.\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. ae + bg = 1\n\n2. af + bh = 0\n\n3. ce + dg = 0\n\n4. cf + dh = 1\n\nWe need to show that BA = [[ea + fc, eb + fd], [ga + hc, gb + hd]] = I.\n\nSo we need:\n\n5. ea + fc = 1\n\n6. eb + fd = 0\n\n7. ga + hc = 0\n\n8. gb + hd = 1\n\nBut how to derive 5-8 from 1-4? Let's try solving this system.\n\nFrom 2: af + bh = 0 => f = -bh/a (assuming a ≠ 0)\n\nFrom 3: ce + dg = 0 => g = -ce/d (assuming d ≠ 0)\n\nPlugging f and g into 1: ae + b*(-ce/d) = 1 => ae - (bce)/d = 1 => e(a - bc/d) = 1 => e = d/(ad - bc)\n\nSimilarly, from 4: c*(-bh/a) + dh = 1 => -bch/a + dh = 1 => h(d - bc/a) = 1 => h = a/(ad - bc)\n\nSo determinant ad - bc appears in denominators, which is det(A). Assuming det(A) ≠ 0.\n\nSimilarly, compute e and h, then f and g can be expressed in terms of a,b,c,d.\n\nThen plug into 5: ea + fc = e a + f c\n\nWe have e = d/det, f = -bh/a = -b*(a/det)/a = -b/det\n\nSo ea + fc = (d/det)*a + (-b/det)*c = (ad - bc)/det = det/det = 1. So 5 holds.\n\nSimilarly for 8: gb + hd = g b + h d\n\ng = -ce/d = -c*(d/det)/d = -c/det\n\nh = a/det\n\nSo gb + hd = (-c/det)*b + (a/det)*d = (-bc + ad)/det = det/det = 1.\n\nFor 6: eb + fd = e b + f d\n\ne = d/det, f = -b/det\n\nSo (d/det)*b + (-b/det)*d = (bd - bd)/det = 0. So 6 holds.\n\nSimilarly for 7: ga + hc = g a + h c\n\ng = -c/det, h = a/det\n\nSo (-c/det)*a + (a/det)*c = (-ac + ac)/det = 0. So 7 holds.\n\nThus, for 2x2 matrices, BA = I. This is a component-wise proof, but it requires assuming that det(A) ≠ 0 and that a and d are non-zero. But if a or d is zero, the expressions for f and g might be different, but since AB = I, det(A) must be non-zero, so the inverse exists. Hence, this shows that BA = I for 2x2 matrices.\n\nBut this approach requires handling each component and solving the system, which might get complicated for larger matrices. However, it's a component-wise proof. For a general n x n matrix, this approach would involve solving for each entry of B in terms of A's entries, using Cramer's rule or something similar, which is essentially expressing B as the inverse of A. Then, verifying that BA's entries are δ_ij.\n\nBut this seems tedious for larger matrices, but theoretically possible. So, perhaps the general proof would involve showing that B is the inverse of A by solving the system AB = I and then verifying BA = I through substitution, which is essentially what the 2x2 case does.\n\nHowever, this might implicitly use the fact that a right inverse is a left inverse in a commutative setting, but matrices aren't commutative. Wait, but over a commutative ring, if AB = I, then BA = I. But matrices over commutative rings (like integers, real numbers, etc.) do not necessarily have this property unless they are square. Wait, but the original problem is about square matrices since AB and BA both need to be defined as the same size for I.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify the matrices are square, but in the original Math Stack Exchange question, the context is about AB = I and BA = I, which implies that A and B are square matrices. Otherwise, if A is m x n and B is n x m, AB is m x m and BA is n x n, and if AB = I_m, then m ≤ n for BA to potentially be I_n, but this complicates things. However, the original question likely refers to square matrices, as otherwise the statement isn't generally true. For example, if A is 2x3 and B is 3x2 with AB = I_2, BA won't be I_3.\n\nThus, assuming A and B are square matrices. So, in the square case, we can use the determinant argument. Since AB = I, det(A)det(B) = 1, so det(A) ≠ 0, hence A is invertible. Thus, B must be the inverse of A, hence BA = I. But this uses determinants, which might be considered component-wise operations (since determinant can be computed via sums of products), but the properties like det(AB)=det(A)det(B) require proof, which might use permutations or other methods. So this is a higher-level concept.\n\nAlternatively, if we can express B in terms of A's adjugate matrix, but again, this is using adjugate which is component-wise but requires knowledge of minors and cofactors.\n\nHmm. It seems challenging to provide a purely component-wise proof without invoking any higher-level concepts. The 2x2 case shows that it's possible for small matrices, but generalizing requires more machinery. However, the original question mentions that a \"machine\" could do it, implying a mechanical, algorithmic approach. Such an approach might involve solving the system AB = I for B's entries and then substituting back into BA to verify it equals I, which is what the 2x2 case illustrates. For larger matrices, this would involve solving a system of equations for each entry of B in terms of A's entries and then substituting back. This is theoretically possible but computationally intensive. However, the existence of such a process shows that a component-wise proof exists, even if it's not elegant.\n\nTherefore, the answer would involve explaining that by solving the system AB = I for the entries of B and then substituting those into BA, one can verify entry-wise that BA = I, which is a tedious but mechanical process. This avoids higher algebraic structures and sticks to component-wise algebra.",
