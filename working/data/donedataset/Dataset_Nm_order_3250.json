    "Content": "I am currently reviewing basic vector analysis and trying to understand every single detail, however, I got stuck in some derivation. What I want to show is the following: Given the del operator (i.e., vector differential operator) in\n  Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ $$\\nabla=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\mathbf{a}_x+\\frac{\\partial\n }{\\partial y}\\mathbf{a}_y+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z$$ show that the corrseponding operator in Cylindrical coordinates\n  $(\\rho, \\phi ,z)$ is given by$$\\nabla=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial\\rho}\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial\n \\phi}\\mathbf{a}_\\phi+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z$$ I tried one approach. However, for curiosity I tried a different method but I couldn't get it right. Approach #1: From the point-to-point transformation\n$$\\rho=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}, \\; \\phi=\\text{tan}\\frac{y}{x}$$ partial differentiation with respect to $x$ and $y$ yields\n\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x} &=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}=\\frac{\\rho \\, \\text{cos}\\phi}{\\rho}=\\text{cos}\\phi \\\\\n                \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}=\\frac{\\rho \\, \\text{sin}\\phi}{\\rho}=\\text{sin}\\phi \n\\end{align}\nand\n\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}&=\\frac{-y}{x^2}\\frac{1}{1+(\\frac{y}{x})^2}=\\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{-\\rho \\, \\text{sin}\\phi}{\\rho^2}=\\frac{-\\text{sin}\\phi}{\\rho} \\\\\n                \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}&=\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{1}{1+(\\frac{y}{x})^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{\\rho \\, \\text{cos}\\phi}{\\rho^2}=\\frac{\\text{cos}\\phi}{\\rho}\n\\end{align} Now, plugging these in the chain rule differentiation formulas \n\\begin{align} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}&=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial y}&=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\n\\end{align} and making use of the unit vector transformation from Cartesian to Cylindrical\n \\begin{align} \\mathbf{a}_x&=\\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho-\\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi\\\\\n\\mathbf{a}_y&=\\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi\n\\end{align} We get\n \\begin{align} \\nabla&=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\mathbf{a}_x+\\frac{\\partial\n }{\\partial y}\\mathbf{a}_y+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z  \\\\\n               &=\\left (\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}  \\right )\\left ( \\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho-\\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi \\right )\\\\\n&+\\left ( \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right )\\left ( \\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi \\right )+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z  \\\\\n               &=\\left (\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\text{cos}\\phi+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{-\\text{sin}\\phi}{\\rho}  \\right )\\left ( \\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho-\\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi \\right )\\\\\n&+\\left ( \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\;\\text{sin}\\phi+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\;\\frac{\\text{cos}\\phi}{\\rho} \\right )\\left ( \\text{sin}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\text{cos}\\phi\\;\\mathbf{a}_\\phi \\right )+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z\\\\\n&=\\left ( \\text{sin}^2\\phi+\\text{cos}^2\\phi \\right )\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\rho}\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left ( \\text{sin}^2\\phi+\\text{cos}^2\\phi \\right )\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\phi}\\mathbf{a}_\\phi+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial\\rho}\\mathbf{a}_\\rho+\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial\n \\phi}\\mathbf{a}_\\phi+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}\\mathbf{a}_z \n\\end{align} which is the desired result. Approach #2: How can I get the same result starting from the point-to-point transformation\n$$x=\\rho \\, \\text{cos}\\phi,\\; y=\\rho \\, \\text{sin}\\phi$$\nby using partial differentiation?

    "AcceptedAnswer": "The coordinate transformation from polar to rectangular coordinates is given by $$\\begin{align}\nx&=\\rho \\cos \\phi \\tag 1\\\\\\\\\ny&=\\rho \\sin \\phi \\tag 2\n\\end{align}$$ Now, suppose that the coordinate transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates as given by $$\\begin{align}\n\\rho&=\\rho (x,y)=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\\\\\\\\n\\phi&=\\phi(x,y)  =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\arctan(y/x)&,x>0\\\\\\\\\n\\arctan(y/x)+\\pi&,x<0,y\\ge 0\\\\\\\\\n\\arctan(y/x)-\\pi&,x<0,y<0\\\\\\\\\n\\pi/2&,x=0,y>0\\\\\\\\\n\\pi/2&,x=0,y<0\\\\\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}$$ were unavailable in closed form.  We can still proceed to develop a transformation of the gradient operator from Cartesian coordinates to polar.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified format. The example they provided involved listing assumptions line by line and then stating the problem. \n\nThe original problem here is about deriving the del operator in cylindrical coordinates. The user tried two approaches, the first one worked, but the second didn't. They want to know how to get the same result using the point-to-point transformation x = ρ cos φ, y = ρ sin φ.\n\nFirst, I need to filter out the unnecessary details. The main problem is to show the del operator in cylindrical coordinates using the given coordinate transformations. The user already succeeded with approach #1 but is stuck on approach #2. The key here is to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the assumptions would include the definitions of the coordinate transformations, the form of the del operator in Cartesian coordinates, and perhaps the relationships between the unit vectors. But since the user wants only one property per line applied to one object, I need to break it down.\n\nAssumptions might include:\n\n- The Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by x = ρ cos φ, y = ρ sin φ, z = z.\n- The del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z.\n- The unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates (a_ρ, a_φ, a_z) are functions of φ.\n- The transformation between unit vectors in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is given by equations like a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ and similarly for a_y.\n- Partial derivatives must be transformed using the chain rule based on the coordinate transformations.\n\nBut wait, in approach #2, the user is starting from x = ρ cos φ and y = ρ sin φ. So maybe the key assumptions are the coordinate transformations and the chain rule for partial derivatives. The problem is to derive the del operator in cylindrical coordinates using these transformations.\n\nBut the original problem's formatted example had assumptions like n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a single condition. Here, the main assumptions would be the coordinate transformations and the expression of the del operator in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nSo, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are transformed to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) via x = ρ cos φ,\ny = ρ sin φ,\nz = z.\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z.\nThe unit vectors a_x and a_y can be expressed in terms of a_ρ and a_φ using a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ and a_y = sin φ a_ρ + cos φ a_φ.\nPartial derivatives in Cartesian coordinates can be expressed in terms of cylindrical coordinates using the chain rule.\n\nBut the example splits each assumption line by line. So each line should be a single assumption. Let me try:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by z = z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe unit vector a_x in Cartesian coordinates is expressed as a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_y in Cartesian coordinates is expressed as a_y = sin φ a_ρ + cos φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_z in Cartesian coordinates is the same as in cylindrical coordinates,\nPartial derivatives with respect to x and y can be expressed in terms of ρ and φ using the chain rule.\n\nBut maybe some of these can be combined. Wait, in the example, each assumption is one line, one property. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, each transformation equation is a separate assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinate x is related to cylindrical coordinates by x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate y is related to cylindrical coordinates by y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate z is equal to the cylindrical coordinate z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe unit vector a_x in Cartesian coordinates is expressed in cylindrical unit vectors as a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_y in Cartesian coordinates is expressed in cylindrical unit vectors as a_y = sin φ a_ρ + cos φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_z in Cartesian coordinates is the same as the cylindrical a_z,\nPartial derivatives with respect to x and y can be converted to cylindrical coordinates using the chain rule.\n\nBut perhaps some of these are redundant. For example, the partial derivatives via chain rule might be part of the method, not the assumptions. Alternatively, the problem might assume that the transformation is given and the del operator is to be derived from that. The problem statement is to show that the del operator in cylindrical coordinates is as given, starting from the Cartesian definition and the coordinate transformation.\n\nSo perhaps the key assumptions are:\n\n- The coordinate transformation equations from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates.\n- The expression of the del operator in Cartesian coordinates.\n- The relationship between Cartesian and cylindrical unit vectors.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the properties of the objects (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumptions are the given equations and definitions.\n\nTherefore, structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are transformed to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) via x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are transformed to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) via y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate z is equal to the cylindrical coordinate z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe unit vectors a_x and a_y in Cartesian coordinates are functions of φ in cylindrical coordinates.\n\nBut maybe even more detailed. For example, each unit vector transformation is a separate assumption:\n\nAssumption:\nThe unit vector a_x in Cartesian coordinates is expressed in cylindrical coordinates as a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_y in Cartesian coordinates is expressed in cylindrical coordinates as a_y = sin φ a_ρ + cos φ a_φ,\nThe unit vector a_z in Cartesian coordinates is identical to the cylindrical a_z,\nPartial derivatives in Cartesian coordinates can be converted to cylindrical coordinates using the chain rule.\n\nBut the problem is to start from the coordinate transformation x = ρ cos φ, y = ρ sin φ, and derive the del operator. So maybe the key assumptions are the coordinate transformations and the expression of the Cartesian del operator.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates x and y are related to cylindrical coordinates ρ and φ by x = ρ cos φ and y = ρ sin φ,\nThe z-coordinate remains the same in both Cartesian and cylindrical systems,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe unit vectors a_ρ, a_φ, and a_z in cylindrical coordinates depend on the position (specifically φ).\n\nBut the user's approach #1 already used the chain rule and unit vector transformations. Approach #2 is trying to do it via the coordinate transformation directly. So maybe the assumptions here are different. The user is asking how to derive the del operator using the given coordinate transformations (x=ρ cos φ, etc.) via partial differentiation, maybe implicit differentiation.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to derive the expression for the del operator in cylindrical coordinates using the given coordinate transformations, starting from the Cartesian form. So the assumptions would be the coordinate transformations and the Cartesian del operator.\n\nSo structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates x and y are expressed in cylindrical coordinates as x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate y is expressed in cylindrical coordinates as y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate z is equal to the cylindrical coordinate z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is defined as ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z.\n\nProblem:\nStarting from the coordinate transformations x = ρ cos φ, y = ρ sin φ, z = z, and the Cartesian del operator, derive the expression for the del operator in cylindrical coordinates: ∇ = (∂/∂ρ) a_ρ + (1/ρ)(∂/∂φ) a_φ + (∂/∂z) a_z.\n\nBut in the original problem, the user is asking to show that the corresponding operator in cylindrical coordinates is as given. So the problem is to perform that derivation using approach #2, which involves the coordinate transformations and partial differentiation.\n\nSo I think the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are related to cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) by y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate z is equal to the cylindrical coordinate z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe unit vectors a_x, a_y in Cartesian coordinates can be expressed in terms of cylindrical unit vectors a_ρ, a_φ.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the del operator in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) is given by ∇ = (∂/∂ρ) a_ρ + (1/ρ)(∂/∂φ) a_φ + (∂/∂z) a_z.\n\nBut the example had each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. So each coordinate transformation (x, y, z) should be separate lines. Also, the unit vector expressions are separate.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Cartesian coordinate x is related to cylindrical coordinates by x = ρ cos φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate y is related to cylindrical coordinates by y = ρ sin φ,\nThe Cartesian coordinate z is equal to the cylindrical coordinate z,\nThe del operator in Cartesian coordinates is ∇ = (∂/∂x) a_x + (∂/∂y) a_y + (∂/∂z) a_z,\nThe Cartesian unit vector a_x is expressed as a_x = cos φ a_ρ - sin φ a_φ,\nThe Cartesian unit vector a_y is expressed as a_y = sin φ a_ρ + cos φ a_φ,\nThe Cartesian unit vector a_z is identical to the cylindrical unit vector a_z.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the corresponding del operator in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z) is ∇ = (∂/∂ρ) a_ρ + (1/ρ)(∂/∂φ) a_φ + (∂/∂z) a_z.\n\nYes, this seems to split each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem then is to show the del operator in cylindrical coordinates.",
