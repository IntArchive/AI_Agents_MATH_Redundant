    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to show that the numerator of the sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/96, when written in its simplest form x/y with gcd(x,y)=1, is divisible by 97. So, they need to prove that 97 divides x.\n\nFirst, I remember that 97 is a prime number. That might be important. Since it's prime, maybe some properties related to modular inverses or Fermat's Little Theorem could come into play here.\n\nThe harmonic series sum up to 96 terms. Hmm. In modular arithmetic, working with fractions can be tricky, but if we consider everything modulo 97, then since 97 is prime, every number from 1 to 96 has an inverse modulo 97. Maybe we can express each term 1/k as k^{-1} mod 97 and then sum them all up modulo 97. If the sum modulo 97 is zero, then the numerator would be divisible by 97.\n\nWait, but how does the sum modulo 97 relate to the numerator x? Let's think. The sum S = x/y, and we know that gcd(x,y) = 1. If we can show that S is congruent to 0 modulo 97, then 97 divides x because y is coprime to 97 (since if y had a factor of 97, then x would have to have that factor too, contradicting gcd(x,y)=1). So, yes, if S ≡ 0 mod 97, then 97 divides x.\n\nSo the strategy is to compute the sum of the reciprocals modulo 97 and show it's zero. But how?\n\nOne thing I remember is that in modular arithmetic, for a prime p, the sum of all inverses modulo p is zero. Wait, is that true? Let's check. For p=5, inverses are 1, 3, 2, 4. Sum is 1+3+2+4=10 ≡ 0 mod 5. Similarly, for p=7, inverses are 1,4,5,2,3,6. Sum is 1+4+5+2+3+6=21 ≡ 0 mod 7. So it seems the sum of inverses from 1 to p-1 is congruent to 0 modulo p. But here we have p=97, and the sum is up to 96. So maybe that's exactly the case here. The sum from k=1 to 96 of 1/k ≡ 0 mod 97.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the sum is 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/96. Since 97 is prime, each term 1/k is equivalent to k^{-1} mod 97. So the sum is equivalent to the sum of inverses from 1 to 96 mod 97, which we think is zero. Hence, the numerator is divisible by 97.\n\nBut why does the sum of inverses modulo p equal zero? Let's see. The inverses of the numbers 1 to p-1 modulo p are just a permutation of the numbers 1 to p-1. So when you sum them, it's the same as summing 1 to p-1, which is (p-1)p/2. For odd primes, p is odd, so p-1 is even, and (p-1)/2 is an integer. So sum is p*(p-1)/2. Modulo p, that's 0 because p divides the term. Therefore, yes, the sum of inverses modulo p is zero.\n\nTherefore, applying this to p=97, the sum 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/96 ≡ 0 mod 97. Hence, the numerator x must be divisible by 97.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the sum is x/y with gcd(x,y)=1. So if the sum is an integer multiple of 1/97, then when written in lowest terms, the denominator might have factors in common with 97, but since 97 is prime, the denominator y must not be divisible by 97 (because x and y are coprime). Therefore, the numerator x must contain all the factors of 97 from the sum. Hence, x is divisible by 97.\n\nI think that's the key idea here. So the assumptions are that we're dealing with the harmonic series up to 1/96, that the fraction x/y is in simplest terms, and that 97 is a prime number. The problem then is to show 97 divides x.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't state that 97 is prime. However, 97 is a known prime number, so maybe that's a hidden assumption. However, when structuring the problem, we need to list all assumptions. But the original problem as stated doesn't mention 97 being prime. But perhaps in the problem statement, we need to include that because the divisibility by 97 relies on its primality.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the example provided in the user's query, the original problem was about divisibility by 91, and the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7, but in the formatted version, it was added. Wait, no, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect? Wait, let me check.\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that... divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the formatted version incorrectly added an extra assumption. So perhaps the example is not properly following the instructions. But maybe the user intended that the problem had some hidden assumptions? Not sure. Maybe the example was a mistake.\n\nBut in any case, going back to the current problem. The problem is to show that the numerator of 1 + 1/2 + ... +1/96 is divisible by 97. The key assumptions here are that the sum is expressed in lowest terms (gcd(x,y)=1), and 97 is prime (since that's necessary for the inverses to exist and the sum of inverses modulo 97 being zero). However, the original problem does not state that 97 is prime. But 97 is a prime, so it's a known fact. So perhaps in the assumptions, we need to list that 97 is prime, and that the fraction is in simplest terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem itself doesn't require assuming 97 is prime, but when structuring, we can list the necessary assumptions. Let's see.\n\nThe problem as stated is: Let x/y = 1 + 1/2 + ... +1/96, gcd(x,y)=1. Show that 97 divides x.\n\nSo the given assumptions are:\n\n- The sum is expressed as x/y where gcd(x,y)=1.\n\nBut to solve the problem, the key steps use that 97 is prime. So perhaps we should include that 97 is a prime number as an assumption. But since 97 is a known prime, maybe it's not necessary. But according to the example, the user included divisibility by 7 as an assumption even though the original problem didn't state it. Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Unless maybe the original problem had a different condition? The user might have made a mistake in their example.\n\nBut assuming that the task is to structure the problem by listing all necessary assumptions, even if they are implicit. So, for the current problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. The sum 1 + 1/2 + ... +1/96 is written as x/y where gcd(x,y)=1.\n\n2. 97 is a prime number. (Since this is crucial for the inverses modulo 97 to exist and for the sum of inverses to be zero modulo 97.)\n\nHowever, the original problem statement does not explicitly mention that 97 is prime. But maybe in the context of the problem, the user is supposed to know that 97 is prime, so it's an implicit assumption. Therefore, in structuring the problem, we should list the assumptions as:\n\n- The fraction x/y is in lowest terms (gcd(x,y)=1).\n\n- 97 is a prime number.\n\nWait, but the problem is presented as is. The user is asking to show that 97 divides x given that the sum equals x/y with gcd(x,y)=1. So maybe the only assumption is that x and y are coprime, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 97. But in reality, the primality of 97 is a necessary condition for the proof. However, since 97 is a well-known prime, perhaps it's considered general knowledge and not an assumption. But according to the example, the user included divisibility by 7 as an assumption even if the original problem didn't state it. Maybe the example was incorrect, but following that, perhaps we need to include 97 being prime as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was different because in that problem, the divisibility by 91 requires that n is divisible by 7 and 13, but maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Anyway, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions should only include the given conditions: x and y are coprime, and the sum is up to 1/96. But the key property needed is that 97 is prime. So to follow the example's approach, even if the original problem doesn't state it, we need to list necessary assumptions. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe fraction x/y is in lowest terms (gcd(x, y) = 1),\n97 is a prime number.\n\nProblem:\nShow that 97 divides x.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention that 97 is prime. However, without that assumption, the problem is not necessarily true. So the problem must be assuming that 97 is prime. Since 97 is a prime, it's a known fact, so maybe it's considered an implicit assumption. But in the example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7 even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\". That seems like a mistake. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but in our case, we should list the assumptions based on what is given.\n\nThe original problem states:\n\n\"Let $\\frac{x}{y}=1+\\frac12 +\\frac13 +\\cdots +\\frac1{96}$ where $\\text{gcd}(x,y)=1$. Show that $97\\;|\\;x$.\"\n\nSo the explicit assumptions here are:\n\n- The sum equals x/y.\n\n- gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nTherefore, when structuring the problem, the assumptions should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nHowever, the key step in the solution uses the fact that 97 is prime, which is an external mathematical fact. Since the problem doesn't state it, but it's necessary for the solution, should we include it as an assumption? Or is it considered general knowledge?\n\nGiven the example provided by the user, where they added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps the user wants to include all mathematical facts required as assumptions. But that seems odd, as assumptions are usually conditions given in the problem. However, maybe in the context of structuring the problem for clarity, we should list all necessary conditions, even if they're mathematical facts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the example, the original problem actually had a typo, and the correct problem required n divisible by 7, hence the assumption. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, we should stick to the given information and only list the assumptions explicitly stated in the problem: the sum is written as x/y with gcd(x,y)=1. The fact that 97 is prime is a necessary part of the solution, but not an assumption of the problem. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption was n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory unless the original problem had a mistake. Perhaps the user made an error in the example. Given that, maybe the current problem should list the necessary assumptions for the problem to hold, even if they are not stated in the original problem. For example, if the original problem's solution requires n to be divisible by 7, but the problem says \"for every integer n\", then there's a mistake. But in the current problem, since 97 is prime, which is a necessary condition, but it's a well-known fact, perhaps it's not listed as an assumption. However, in the solution, we do use that 97 is prime.\n\nBut since the problem is to structure the problem as per the example, and in the example, the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) not present in the original problem (which said \"for every integer n\"), perhaps the user expects to include such hidden assumptions. Therefore, maybe in this case, we should include \"97 is a prime number\" as an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions in the example were incorrect, and we should only list the assumptions given in the problem. But given the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to list the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem: the sum is written as x/y with gcd(x,y)=1. The primality of 97 is a mathematical fact, not an assumption of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n$1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut I need to check the example again. In the example, the original problem was:\n\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n can be any integer. But adding \"n is divisible by 7\" restricts n to multiples of 7. That seems like a mistake. Perhaps the example is incorrect. Therefore, following that example, even if the original problem doesn't state certain conditions, we might need to add them as assumptions. But that would be incorrect. It's possible that the user made a mistake in their example.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to list only the assumptions explicitly mentioned in the problem, and not add external mathematical facts. So in the current problem, the assumptions are:\n\n- The sum is expressed as x/y.\n\n- gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nAnd the problem is to show 97 divides x.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut to match the example's style, perhaps each assumption is a separate line addressing one property. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe harmonic series $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as a fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$,\nThe fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is in lowest terms (i.e., $\\gcd(x, y) = 1$).\n\nProblem:\nShow that the numerator $x$ is divisible by $97$.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were listed as \"$n$ is an integer\", \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property of one object.\n\nTherefore, translating that to this problem:\n\nAssumption:\n$x$ and $y$ are integers such that $\\frac{x}{y} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut even here, the first assumption combines two things: that x and y are integers representing the sum, and the sum expression. To split into separate lines per the example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is equal to $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$x$ and $y$ are integers,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut in the example, each assumption is one property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nSimilarly, here:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sum $1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ is expressed as a fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$,\n$x$ and $y$ are integers,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nBut I think this is splitting hairs. The key is that each assumption is one condition on one object. So \"x and y are integers\" is one condition, and \"gcd(x, y) = 1\" is another. However, \"The sum ... is expressed as a fraction x/y\" is another assumption. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation $\\frac{x}{y} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$ holds,\n$x$ and $y$ are integers,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\n\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.\n\nYes, this way each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one property. The first line states the equality, the second that x and y are integers (since the sum of rationals is rational, but we need to ensure x and y are integers in the fraction), and third that they are coprime.\n\nBut actually, the original problem already states that x/y is the sum and gcd(x,y)=1, so perhaps the user just needs to list those as assumptions. The fact that x and y are integers is inherent in the fraction representation.\n\nSo final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption:\n$\\frac{x}{y} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{96}$,\n$\\gcd(x, y) = 1$.\nProblem:\nShow that $97$ divides $x$.",
