    "Content": "It's my first question!  I hope I'm correctly formatting it. I'm trying to prove that two connections $\\nabla, \\widetilde{\\nabla}$ on a manifold determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating.  The difference tensor of two connections is the tensor $D(X,Y) = \\widetilde{\\nabla}_XY - \\nabla_XY$, so this is saying that the geodesics are the same for the two connections iff $D(X,Y) = -D(Y,X)$ for all vector fields $X, Y$ on $M$. Since $D$ is a tensor it can be written as a sum of its symmetric and alternating parts, $D = S + A$.  Since $A(X,X) \\equiv 0$ we have $D(X,X) = S(X,X)$.  So if $S(X,X) = 0$ then so does $D(X,X)$, and if $D(X,X)$ is always $0$, then $$ D(X+Y,X+Y) =S(X+Y, X+Y) = S(X,X) + S(Y,Y) + 2S(X,Y) = 2S(X,Y)$$ Then $S(X,Y) \\equiv 0$.  So it's enough to check that having the same geodesics is the same as $D(X,X) \\equiv 0$.  This observation was made in Spivak Vol. II Ch. 6, Addendum 1, but his proof that this latter condition is equivalent to the connections having the same geodesics doesn't make sense to me. Does anyone know how to show that if the connections have the same geodesics then the difference tensor is $0$ on the diagonal?  That's the direction I'm stuck on.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Assume that the tensor $D$ vanishes. Let $\\alpha$ be a geodesic with respect to one of the connections, say $\\nabla$. Then  $$\\nabla_TT\\equiv 0$$where $T=\\dot \\alpha$. Using the identity $D\\equiv 0$, we get $$\\bar\\nabla_TT=0$$ i.e. the connection $\\bar\\nabla$ has the same geodesic. Conversely, we assume that $\\nabla$ and $\\bar\\nabla$ have the same geodesics. Let $X$ be any vector field. We will prove that $D$ vanishes point-wise. Let $p\\in M$ with nbd $U$ and let $\\gamma$ be the geodesic with $\\gamma(0)=p,\\dot\\gamma(0)=X_p$(ODE guarantees that there is a unique such geodesic), then\n$$D(X_p,X_p)=(\\nabla_XX-\\bar\\nabla_XX)_p=0$$i.e. $D$ vanishes at $p$ and consequently at every point.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user is asking about two connections on a manifold determining the same geodesics if and only if their difference tensor is alternating. They mention the difference tensor D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y, and that the problem reduces to showing that D(X,X) = 0 for all X if the geodesics are the same. The user is stuck on the direction where having the same geodesics implies D(X,X) is zero.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nAssumptions from the problem:\n1. ∇ and ∇̃ are two connections on a manifold M.\n2. The difference tensor D is defined as D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y for all vector fields X, Y on M.\n3. D can be decomposed into symmetric part S and alternating part A, so D = S + A.\n4. The geodesics determined by ∇ and ∇̃ are the same.\n5. A tensor that is alternating satisfies A(X,X) = 0 for all X.\n\nThe problem is to prove that if two connections have the same geodesics, then their difference tensor D is alternating, i.e., D(X,Y) = -D(Y,X) for all X,Y, which is equivalent to S = 0 (since S is the symmetric part). The user specifically needs help showing that if geodesics are the same, then D(X,X) = 0 for all X, which would imply S(X,Y) = 0.\n\nWait, in the original question, the user states that Spivak's proof doesn't make sense to them, and they are stuck on the direction where same geodesics imply D(X,X) ≡ 0. So the problem is to show that if ∇ and ∇̃ have the same geodesics, then D(X,X) = 0 for all X. Once that is done, since D(X,X) = S(X,X), this would imply S ≡ 0, hence D is alternating.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are the two connections, their difference tensor, and the same geodesics. The problem is to show that D(X,X) = 0 for all X given same geodesics.\n\nSo structuring the assumptions line by line:\n\nAssumption:\n∇ and ∇̃ are connections on manifold M,\nThe geodesics of ∇ and ∇̃ are the same,\nD(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y is the difference tensor.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X on M.\n\nWait, but the original problem is more about the equivalence between same geodesics and D being alternating. However, the user's specific question is about the direction where same geodesics imply D(X,X) = 0. So perhaps the problem as stated by the user is: Show that if two connections have the same geodesics, then their difference tensor D satisfies D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions list each condition line by line. So in this case:\n\nAssumptions should be:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- The geodesics determined by ∇ and ∇̃ are the same.\n- The difference tensor D is defined as D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X on M.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem statement is about the equivalence (if and only if), but the user is specifically stuck on the forward direction (same geodesics imply alternating difference tensor). However, the problem as presented in the question is to prove the equivalence. But the user's actual problem is the direction where same geodesics imply D(X,X)=0.\n\nWait, the original title is \"When Two Connections Determine the Same Geodesics\". The question starts by stating the goal is to prove that two connections determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating. So the full problem is the equivalence. But the user is stuck on the forward direction: if they have same geodesics, then D is alternating. The key step there is showing D(X,X)=0, which they need help with.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part should state the problem to be solved. In the example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was perhaps an added assumption? Wait, looking back, the example seems to have added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem was for every integer n. Wait, the example might have been modified. Let me check.\n\nIn the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem was for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect? Because 91 is 7×13, and perhaps the actual problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but maybe the example mistakenly added n divisible by 7. Hmm. But perhaps the example is just illustrative of the formatting, not necessarily correct. So the user wants us to take the original problem, filter out unrelated info, and structure it with assumptions and problem.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is about two connections determining same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating. The user has reduced it to showing that same geodesics imply D(X,X)=0. So the problem as per the user's need is to prove that if two connections have the same geodesics, then their difference tensor satisfies D(X,X)=0 for all X. Hence, the formatted problem would list the assumptions and then the problem.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- The geodesics of ∇ and ∇̃ coincide.\n- The difference tensor D is defined as D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X on M.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to show the equivalence (iff), then the problem would be \"Prove that ∇ and ∇̃ determine the same geodesics if and only if D is alternating\". But the user is focusing on the direction where same geodesics imply D is alternating, and specifically on showing D(X,X)=0.\n\nBut given the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the original question, filtering unrelated info. The original problem is to prove the equivalence, but the user is stuck on a specific direction. However, the format requires us to present the problem as stated, not the user's specific stuck point. But the example seems to modify the original problem by adding an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. So maybe the user's example is incorrect, but following that example, we might need to adjust.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that changes the problem. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example is just illustrative of the format, not a correct restructuring. So perhaps we should follow the instruction to structure the problem as per the given format, listing assumptions and the problem.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is: Prove that two connections determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating. The user provides context and their own steps, but the core problem is the equivalence. However, the user's specific question is about one direction of the proof. But according to the instructions, we need to present the problem as found in the original question, filtered of unrelated info. So the main problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut the user's own steps mention that they reduced it to showing that same geodesics imply D(X,X)=0. However, in structuring the problem, we should present the main problem as stated, not the user's progress. The original question's title is \"When Two Connections Determine the Same Geodesics\", and the problem is to prove the equivalence. So the formatted problem should reflect that.\n\nHowever, in the example, the formatted problem was a modified version, adding an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is incorrect, but following the user's instructions, we have to follow the format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are to list all given conditions. In the current problem, the original problem's assumptions are:\n\n- Two connections ∇ and ∇̃ on a manifold M.\n- Their difference tensor D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y.\n- The geodesics of ∇ and ∇̃ are the same.\n\nBut the equivalence is to show that the geodesics are the same iff D is alternating. So the problem is to prove that two connections have the same geodesics if and only if their difference tensor is alternating.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about the direction where same geodesics imply D is alternating, and specifically showing D(X,X)=0. However, according to the instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the original question, not the user's specific stuck point. But the example seems to have modified the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not including the thing to prove.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption is n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake unless the original problem was mistyped. Alternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user provided it as an example. So following that, perhaps when structuring, we list the assumptions given in the problem and the problem to be solved.\n\nBut in the current case, the problem is to prove an equivalence. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- The difference tensor D is defined as D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∇ and ∇̃ determine the same geodesics if and only if D is alternating (i.e., D(X,Y) = -D(Y,X) for all X,Y).\n\nBut the user's own text mentions that Spivak's proof is unclear and they are stuck on the direction where same geodesics imply D(X,X)=0. However, per instructions, we need to structure the problem as per the original question, not the user's specific confusion. So the main problem is the equivalence.\n\nBut the user's question includes their own progress and specific confusion, but we need to filter out unrelated info. The core problem is the equivalence. So the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on manifold M.\n- D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y is the difference tensor.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∇ and ∇̃ determine the same geodesics if and only if D is alternating.\n\nHowever, in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer, and the formatted problem listed that. Similarly, here, the connections are on a manifold, so that's an assumption.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions should include everything given. Wait, the problem is to prove the equivalence, so the assumptions are the conditions given. But in the problem statement, the user says \"two connections determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating\". So the problem is to prove this statement, and the assumptions would include that ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on M, and D is their difference tensor. However, the \"if and only if\" is part of the problem statement, not assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y is the difference tensor of ∇ and ∇̃.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∇ and ∇̃ determine the same geodesics if and only if D is alternating.\n\nBut the user's specific issue is about one direction of this proof, but according to the instructions, we need to present the original problem, not the user's specific question. However, the user's question is part of the problem statement. Wait, the original question is the user asking for help with a specific direction. So perhaps we need to structure their specific problem.\n\nThe user writes: \"Does anyone know how to show that if the connections have the same geodesics then the difference tensor is $0$ on the diagonal? That's the direction I'm stuck on.\"\n\nSo their specific problem is to show that if two connections have the same geodesics, then D(X,X)=0 for all X. The equivalence is the broader problem, but their question is about this specific part.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should reflect their specific question. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- The geodesics of ∇ and ∇̃ are the same.\n- D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y is the difference tensor.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X on M.\n\nThis aligns with the example where the original problem was broader, but the formatted problem focused on a specific case (adding an assumption that n is divisible by 7). However, in this case, the user is stuck on a specific direction, so we structure their problem accordingly.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps in the example, the user intended to modify the problem, but here, we need to be accurate.\n\nThe user's specific problem is: Show that if two connections have the same geodesics, then D(X,X)=0. So the assumptions are the connections, same geodesics, and the difference tensor. The problem is to prove D(X,X)=0.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatted problem is:\n\nAssumption:\n- ∇ and ∇̃ are connections on a manifold M.\n- The geodesics determined by ∇ and ∇̃ are the same.\n- The difference tensor D is defined as D(X,Y) = ∇̃_X Y - ∇_X Y.\n\nProblem:\nProve that D(X,X) = 0 for all vector fields X on M.\n\nYes, this captures the user's specific question. The broader equivalence is the original problem, but the user is stuck on this part, so structuring it this way makes sense.",
