    "Content": "I'm trying to solve the following exercise of the book \"Grupos de Lie - Luiz A. B. San Martin  (exercise 18, page 55)\": Exercise: Let $G$ be a topological group (if necessary, $G$ is Hausdorff) and $H_1 \\subset H_2\\subset G$ closed subgroups of $G$ . Show that if $G/H_2$ and $H_2/H_1$ are compact, then $G/H_1$ is compact. Some comments... It is easy to see that the function \\begin{align*}\n\\pi: G/H_1 &\\to G/H_2 \\\\\ng H_1 & \\mapsto g H_2,\n\\end{align*} is a continuous and open function, nevertheless $\\pi$ also satisfies $g_1 \\cdot \\pi(g_2) = \\pi(g_1\\cdot g_2)$ , $\\forall \\ g_1 \\in G,\\ $ ( $g_1 \\cdot (g_2 H) = (g_1 \\cdot g_2) H$ ). Although I am aware of the following theorem: Theorem: Let $G$ be a topological group, and $H$ a closed subgroup of $G$ , if $H$ and $G/H$ are compact then $G$ is compact. I can't apply it to solve my problem, once neither $G/H_1$ nor $H_2/H_1$ are topological groups. So, I tried to adapt the proof of the theorem cited above for my case, and it is necessary to show that the function $ \\pi $ is a closed function, \n which I was not able to conclude. Can anyone help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Lemma. The map $\\pi$ is closed. Proof . Let $F_1\\subset G/H_1$ be any closed set and $x_2\\in G/H_2\\setminus  \\pi(F_1)$ be any point. We shall construct a neighborhood of $x_2$ disjoint from $\\pi(F_1)$ . For each $i=1,2$ let $q_i:G\\to G/H_i$ be the quotient maps. We have $q_2^{-1}(x_2)=xH_2$ for some point $x\\in G$ . Put $F=q_1^{-1}(F_1)$ and remark that $F$ is closed in $G$ and $F=FH_1$ . Since $x_2\\not\\in \\pi(F_1)$ , the sets $F$ and $xH_2$ are disjoint. Let $y\\in xH_2$ be any point. Since the set $F$ is closed, $y\\not\\in F$ , and $G$ is a Hausdorff topological group, there exists an open neighborhood $O_y=O_y^{-1}$ of the identity of $G$ such that $O_y^2y\\cap F=\\varnothing$ . Since $F=FH_1$ , $O_y^2yH_1\\cap F=\\varnothing$ and so $q_1(O_y^2yH_1)\\cap q_1(F)=\\varnothing$ . Remark that $O_{y1}=q_1(O_yyH_1)$ is an open neighborhood of a point $yH_1\\in G/H_1$ . Since a map $tH_1\\mapsto xtH_1$ for each $t\\in H$ is a homeomorphism of a space $G/H_1$ , the set $xH_2/H_1$ is homeomorphic to $H_2/H_1$ , so it is compact. Since $\\{O_{y1}:y\\in xH_2\\}$ is an open cover of the set $H_2/H_1$ , there exists a finite subset $Y$ of $xH_2$ such that $xH_2\\subset\\bigcup \\{O_{y1}:y\\in Y\\}$ . Put $O=\\bigcap\\{Oy: y\\in Y\\}$ . We claim that $F\\cap OxH_2=\\varnothing$ . Indeed, suppose to the contrary that there exists a point $z\\in F\\cap OxH_2$ . Since $xH_2\\subset\\bigcup \\{O_{y1}:y\\in Y\\}$ , there exists a point $y\\in Y$ such that $z\\in O=O_yyH_1\\subset O_y^2H_1$ , a contradiction, because $O_y^2yH_1\\cap F=\\varnothing$ . So a set $q_2(OxH_2)$ is a neighborhood of $x_2$ and $q_2(OxH_2)\\cap \\pi(F_1)= q_2(OxH_2)\\cap q_2(FH_2)=\\varnothing$ . $\\square$ Since $H_1$ is closed in $G$ , the space $G/H_1$ is Hausdorff and we see that the map $\\pi$ is perfect.\nSo the space $G/H_1$ is compact by Theorem 3.7.2 from “General topology” by Ryszard Engelking (Heldermann Verlag, Berlin, 1989)).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to structure this problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original problem is about proving that if H₁ and H₂ are closed subgroups of a topological group G, with H₁ ⊂ H₂ ⊂ G, and if the quotient spaces G/H₂ and H₂/H₁ are compact, then G/H₁ is compact. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. G is a topological group. The user mentions \"if necessary, G is Hausdorff,\" but the problem statement doesn't specify that as a mandatory condition. However, sometimes in topology, especially when dealing with quotient spaces, Hausdorffness is assumed. But since the original problem says \"if necessary,\" maybe it's optional. Hmm, but the user structured an example where they didn't include the Hausdorff condition unless explicitly stated. So perhaps I should only include it if it's part of the problem's given assumptions. The original problem says \"Let G be a topological group (if necessary, G is Hausdorff)\", which seems like the problem allows G to be Hausdorff if needed, but it's not a strict assumption. However, since the user wants assumptions that are explicitly given, maybe we should not include Hausdorff unless it's required. But the problem as stated doesn't list it as a strict condition. So perhaps the assumption is just that G is a topological group.\n\n2. H₁ and H₂ are closed subgroups of G. So each of H₁ and H₂ is a closed subgroup. Since H₁ is a subset of H₂, which is a subset of G, both are closed in G.\n\n3. H₁ ⊂ H₂ ⊂ G: This is part of the problem's setup, so each inclusion is an assumption. But how to phrase this. The problem states H₁ is a subset of H₂, which is a subset of G. So maybe two separate assumptions: H₁ is a subgroup of G, H₂ is a subgroup of G, H₁ is contained in H₂. Wait, but the original problem says \"H₁ ⊂ H₂ ⊂ G\" and they are closed subgroups. So perhaps:\n\n- H₁ is a closed subgroup of G.\n\n- H₂ is a closed subgroup of G.\n\n- H₁ is a subset of H₂.\n\nBut the problem states \"H₁ ⊂ H₂ ⊂ G\" so maybe H₂ is a closed subgroup containing H₁. But to split into separate assumptions, each addressing one property.\n\nThen the other conditions: G/H₂ is compact, and H₂/H₁ is compact. So those are separate assumptions.\n\nSo compiling all the assumptions:\n\n- G is a topological group.\n\n- H₁ is a closed subgroup of G.\n\n- H₂ is a closed subgroup of G.\n\n- H₁ is a subset of H₂.\n\n- The quotient space G/H₂ is compact.\n\n- The quotient space H₂/H₁ is compact.\n\nEach of these is a separate line, each addressing one property.\n\nThe problem statement then is to prove that G/H₁ is compact.\n\nNow, checking if any other implicit assumptions. The original problem mentions that π: G/H₁ → G/H₂ is continuous, open, and satisfies a certain equivariance condition. But those are part of the user's attempt, not the problem's assumptions. The problem itself is just the setup with the given conditions. So the assumptions are as listed above.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions listed as each of those points, and the problem is to show G/H₁ is compact.\n\nLet me check the example given. In the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So in that case, the problem had two assumptions, each on a separate line. Similarly here, each of the conditions (G is a topological group, H₁ closed, H₂ closed, H₁⊂H₂, G/H₂ compact, H₂/H₁ compact) are separate assumptions.\n\nSo the final answer should list each of these as separate lines under Assumption, and the problem is to show G/H₁ is compact.",
