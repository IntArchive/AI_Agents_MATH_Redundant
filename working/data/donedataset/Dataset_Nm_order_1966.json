    "Content": "Inspired by this answer , I wondered whether a printer could render all continuous functions \"well enough\". In particular, I am curious about the following statement: Let $S$ be a compact, connected subset of $\\mathbb R^2$. For any $\\varepsilon>0$ define $$S_{\\varepsilon}=\\bigcup_{s\\in S}B(s,\\varepsilon)$$ where $B(s,\\varepsilon)$ ithe ball of radius $\\varepsilon$ around $s$ (under the usual metric) - that is $S_{\\varepsilon}$ is $S$ \"expanded\" everywhere by $\\varepsilon$. For all $S$ and $\\varepsilon$, must there exist a curve $\\gamma:\\mathbb [0,1]\\rightarrow\\mathbb R^2$ of finite length such that $$S_{\\varepsilon}=\\bigcup_{x\\in[0,1]}B(\\gamma(x),\\varepsilon)$$ Or, putting it informally: Given a compact, connected set, is it possible for a printer, which always draws a swath of radius $\\varepsilon$, to render the set as closely as possible? My thinking is \"yes\", because, we can clearly do this if we allow any sloppiness -that is, if we don't care whether the the points within some $0<\\varepsilon'$ of the boundary of $S_{\\varepsilon}$ are covered. Hopefully, complex figures on the boundary will be swallowed up when we expand out the set $S$ - but I'm suspicious of pathological examples and can't seem to draw up a proof or counterexample. A statement I believe is equivalent (and of which equivalence I believe a simple proof likely exists) is the following: Define $F_{\\varepsilon}(S)$ to be the \"inflation\" of $S$ by $\\varepsilon$ - the set of points within $\\varepsilon$ of some $s\\in S$. Define $f_{\\varepsilon}(S)$ to be the \"deflation\" of $S$ by $\\varepsilon$ - the set of points $s\\in S$ such that the ball of radius $\\varepsilon$ around is contained in $S$. Then, we wish to show that the boundary of $f_{\\varepsilon}(F_{\\varepsilon}(S))$ has finite length for any compact $S$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Here's a proof that the boundary of $f_\\epsilon(F_\\epsilon(S))$ does have finite length for each $\\epsilon > 0$. I'll use the following inequality for any compact $S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$,\n\\begin{align}\n{\\rm perimeter}(F_\\epsilon(S))\\le \\frac2\\epsilon{\\rm area}(F_\\epsilon(S)).&&{\\rm(1)}\n\\end{align}\nMore on why this holds in a bit. First, I'll use it to prove the result asked for. Note that $f_\\epsilon(S)$ is the set of points of distance at least distance $\\epsilon$ from the complement of $S$ and, hence,\n$$\n\\partial f_\\epsilon(S)=\\partial F_\\epsilon(\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus S),\n$$\nwhere $\\partial S$ denotes the boundary of a set $S$.\nSo,\n$$\n\\partial f_\\epsilon(F_\\epsilon(S))=\\partial F_\\epsilon(\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus F_\\epsilon(S)).\n$$\nNow, if $S$ is contained in the closed ball $\\bar B_R$ of radius $R$ about the origin, then $F_\\epsilon(S)$ is contained in $\\bar B_{R+\\epsilon}$ giving,\n$$\n\\partial F_\\epsilon(\\bar B_{R+\\epsilon}\\setminus F_\\epsilon(S))=\\partial\\bar B_{R+2\\epsilon}\\cup\\partial F_\\epsilon(\\mathbb{R}^2\\setminus F_\\epsilon(S))=\\partial\\bar B_{R+2\\epsilon}\\cup\\partial f_\\epsilon(F_\\epsilon(S)).\n$$\nPutting this together with (1),\n\\begin{align}\n{\\rm perimeter}(f_\\epsilon(F_\\epsilon(S)))&={\\rm perimeter}(F_\\epsilon(\\bar B_{R+\\epsilon}\\setminus F_\\epsilon(S)))-{\\rm perimeter}(\\bar B_{R+2\\epsilon})\\\\\n&\\le\\frac2\\epsilon{\\rm area}(F_\\epsilon(\\bar B_{R+\\epsilon}))\\\\\n&=\\frac2\\epsilon\\pi(R+2\\epsilon)^2 < \\infty,\n\\end{align}\nwhich concludes the proof. Let me now show why (1) holds. There is a quick proof for $S$ a finite set, as given by Theorem 5.3 in the PhD thesis by Zoltán Gyenes . By compactness, for any $\\delta > 0$, there exists a finite subset $A$ of $S$ such that $F_{\\epsilon}(A)\\supset F_{\\epsilon-\\delta}(S)$, so the boundary of $F_{\\epsilon}(S)$ lies within a distance $\\delta$ of the boundary of $F_\\epsilon(A)$. Fixing $N$ points around the boundary of $F_\\epsilon(S)$, these points all lie within $\\delta$ of points on the boundary of $F_\\epsilon(A)$ so, the length of the piecewise linear curve interpolating these points is bounded by\n\\begin{align}\nN(2\\delta)+{\\rm perimeter}F_\\epsilon(A)&\\le 2 N\\delta+\\frac2{\\epsilon}{\\rm area}F_\\epsilon(A)\\\\\n&\\le 2 N\\delta+\\frac2\\epsilon{\\rm area}F_\\epsilon(S)\n\\end{align}\nLetting $N$ go to infinity gives (1) for the compact set $S$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read through the original question carefully. The user is asking whether, given a compact connected set S in R² and any ε > 0, there exists a curve γ of finite length such that the ε-expansion of S (S_ε) is equal to the union of ε-balls around points in γ. The informal version is about a printer drawing a swath of radius ε to cover S_ε.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions several conditions:\n\n1. S is a compact subset of R².\n2. S is connected.\n3. ε is a positive real number (since ε > 0).\n4. S_ε is the union of ε-balls around each point in S.\n5. The problem is to find a curve γ: [0,1] → R² with finite length such that S_ε is the union of ε-balls around γ's image.\n\nWait, the original problem states \"for all S and ε, must there exist a curve γ...\" So the assumptions are that S is compact, connected in R², ε > 0. The problem is to show existence of such a γ with finite length that covers S_ε via the union of ε-balls around γ's points.\n\nSo the assumptions should list each property of S and ε. Let me check the example given. In the example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So each assumption is a separate line, each addressing one condition on one object.\n\nIn this problem, the key assumptions are:\n\n- S is a compact subset of R².\n- S is connected.\n- ε is a positive real number (ε > 0).\n\nThe problem is to prove that there exists a curve γ with finite length such that S_ε is the union of the ε-balls around γ([0,1]).\n\nI should also check if there are more assumptions. The user mentions \"for all S and ε\", so the problem is universal over all such S and ε. Therefore, the assumptions are that S is compact, connected in R², and ε > 0.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was translated into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the user had added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait the original example's problem states \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect because the original problem didn't require n to be divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example was a bad one, but perhaps the user made an error. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem in the example is to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But in the formatted problem, the assumptions are \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was an incorrect one? Wait, but the user provided that example as their own, so perhaps they had a different problem in mind. Wait, but the example might have been a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show that the problem is to prove divisibility by 91 under the assumption that n is an integer divisible by 7. Hmm, perhaps that example is incorrect, but regardless, I need to follow the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The user's question is whether for all compact connected S in R² and ε > 0, there's a finite-length curve γ such that S_ε is covered by the union of ε-balls around γ's image. The assumptions should be the conditions on S and ε. So each line in the assumption should be one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- S is a compact subset of ℝ²,\n- S is connected,\n- ε is a positive real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that there exists a curve γ: [0,1] → ℝ² of finite length such that S_ε = ⋃_{x∈[0,1]} B(γ(x), ε).\n\nI need to make sure that all assumptions are listed. The problem states \"Given a compact, connected set\", so the first two assumptions. Then \"for any ε>0\", so the third assumption. The problem is to show the existence of γ with finite length such that the union of ε-balls around γ covers S_ε.\n\nWait, but S_ε is already defined as the union of ε-balls around S. The problem is to cover S_ε with a union of ε-balls around a curve of finite length. Wait, but S_ε is the expansion of S by ε. So the problem is to find a curve γ such that when you take the union of ε-balls around all points of γ, you get exactly S_ε. So γ must trace out a path such that every point in S_ε is within ε of some point on γ. But S_ε is already the set of points within ε of S. So the problem is to find a curve γ such that S_ε is equal to the union of ε-balls around γ's image. Alternatively, γ's ε-neighborhood must equal S_ε. But since S_ε is the ε-neighborhood of S, the problem is to find a curve γ whose ε-neighborhood is exactly S_ε. Wait, but that's equivalent to saying that γ is a subset of S_ε and that every point in S_ε is within ε of γ. So γ must be a 1-dimensional curve that is a \"skeleton\" such that its ε-neighborhood covers S_ε, which itself is the ε-neighborhood of S.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a confusion here. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: For all S and ε, must there exist a curve γ: [0,1] → R² of finite length such that S_ε = union of B(γ(x), ε) over x in [0,1].\n\nBut S_ε is defined as the union of B(s, ε) for s in S. So the question is whether S_ε can also be expressed as the union of ε-balls centered along some curve γ of finite length. The user is asking if such a γ exists for any compact connected S and any ε > 0.\n\nSo the assumptions are on S (compact, connected in R²) and ε (positive). The problem is to prove the existence of such a γ with finite length.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumptions as listed, and the problem statement as given.",
