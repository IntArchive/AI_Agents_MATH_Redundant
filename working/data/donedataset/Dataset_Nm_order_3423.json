    "Content": "Give a combinatorial proof of the identity: $$\\sum_{k=1}^n k \\binom{n}{k}^2 = {n}\\binom{2n-1}{n-1}$$ I am not exactly sure where to start. Since $\\binom{n}{k}^2 = \\binom{n}{k}\\binom{n}{k}$, thus, above equation says that we are choosing k elements out of n elements and we are doing it twice where k starts from 0 and goes all the way to n and we add all of them up. However, about the right side, I have no idea what to say and how it fits in this situation. Any help will be grately appreciated.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Let there be $n$ girls and $n$ boys, therefore $2n$ people in total, and out of these, you must make a group of $n$ people which contains at least one girl, and appoint one girl from the chosen group the \"head\" of the group. In how many ways can this be done? One way of counting this, is picking that head girl in $n$ ways, and then choosing the rest of the people in the group in $\\binom{2n-1}{n-1}$ ways. So that gives the right hand side. Another way of doing this, is to say,fix the number of girls you want in your group, say $k$. Now, Choose $k$ girls for your group, this is done in $\\binom nk$ ways. Exclude $k$ boys out of $n$ from the group you want to make, this is also done in $\\binom nk$ ways. Now, the group of girls you chose, along with the non-excluded boys, gives a group of $n$ people. You can choose a head from among the $k$ girls in $k$ ways. Since the above can be done for every $k=1$ to $n$(this would be a group having only girls) we get $\\sum_{k=1}^n k\\binom nk^2$(first choose the girls, then exclude the boys, then choose the head girl). Hence, equality follows. EDIT: A combinatorial proof for any identity is essentially a set whose cardinality can be found in two different ways given the right and left hand sides of the identity, along with the explanations of these countings. Usually (and therefore not always), a sum involves a break up into cases. For each value the parameter takes, you end up counting some subset of the set at hand (in our case, the disjoint subset is exactly those cases where exactly $k$ girls are there in the group, for each $k$), and these subsets are disjoint and their union is the set. On the other hand, a combination $\\binom mn$ is indicative of \"free\" choice, and in counting the cardinality free choice often plays a big role, as it did in our case. Usual proofs involve taking such a set : one way of counting is looking at free choices and putting them together, and another is by breaking into cases and then solving each case, as we did here. Usual tricks for such a set come only with practice, for example the introduction of the \"head\" girl here.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this combinatorial proof problem. The identity to prove is the sum from k=1 to n of k times binomial(n,k) squared equals n times binomial(2n-1, n-1). The user is asking for a combinatorial proof, so I need to think of a counting argument where both sides represent different ways of counting the same thing.\n\nFirst, the left side: sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n,k)^2. Breaking this down, C(n,k) is choosing k elements from a set of n, and squaring it might mean choosing two subsets of size k, maybe from two different sets? Then multiplied by k. So perhaps we're counting pairs of subsets (A, B) each of size k, with some additional structure related to k. But why multiply by k? Maybe there's a selection of an element from one of these subsets?\n\nAlternatively, think of k*C(n,k)^2 as C(n,k)*k*C(n,k). The term k*C(n,k) is like choosing a subset of size k and then picking a leader or a special element from that subset. So maybe the left side counts the number of ways to choose a subset A of size k, a subset B of size k, and a distinguished element from A. Then sum over all k from 1 to n.\n\nNow the right side is n*C(2n-1, n-1). Let's parse that. C(2n-1, n-1) is the number of ways to choose n-1 elements from 2n-1. But multiplied by n, maybe it's related to selecting a special element first and then choosing the remaining n-1 from the rest. For example, if there are 2n elements, and you pick one as special, then choose n-1 from the remaining 2n-1. Wait, but C(2n-1, n-1) is the same as C(2n-1, n), which is part of the formula for C(2n, n) split by a particular element. Maybe the right side is counting the number of ways to choose a committee of size n with a leader from a group of 2n people. Let's see: choose the leader first (n choices if the committee is from n people?), but wait, 2n-1 might come from a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, suppose there are n men and n women. The total number of people is 2n. The right side n*C(2n-1, n-1) can be interpreted as selecting a leader (say, one of the n men) and then choosing n-1 more people from the remaining 2n-1. That would give a committee of size n with one leader. But how does this relate to the left side?\n\nAlternatively, consider a scenario where you have two groups of size n each. Choosing a subset A from the first group and a subset B from the second group, both of size k, then selecting a special element from A. The total would be sum over k of k*C(n,k)*C(n,k). But the right side might count the same scenario differently. For instance, if we consider all possible pairs (A,B) where A and B are subsets of size k from two different n-element sets, and then a leader from A, maybe this can be modeled as choosing a leader first, then choosing the rest of A and B such that the leader is included in A. Wait, if we fix a leader in the first group, say there are n choices for the leader. Then we need to choose the remaining k-1 elements of A from the remaining n-1 in the first group, and choose k elements in the second group. But then summing over k would give sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1)*C(n, k). But that sum is equal to C(2n-1, n-1), which is the right side multiplied by n. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf we fix a leader (n choices), then for each leader, we need to choose the rest of A (from n-1) and choose B from the second n. The total number for each leader is sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1)*C(n, k). Let's change variable: let m = k-1. Then sum_{m=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, m)*C(n, m+1) = sum_{m=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, m)*C(n, n - (m+1) +1) ??? Wait, maybe using Vandermonde's identity. The sum of C(a, m)*C(b, c - m) over m is C(a+b, c). But here, we have sum_{m=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, m)*C(n, m+1). Let’s adjust indices. Let p = m+1, then sum_{p=1}^n C(n-1, p-1)*C(n, p). Which is the same as sum_{p=1}^n C(n, p)*C(n-1, p-1). But Vandermonde's identity tells us that sum_p C(n, p)*C(m, r-p) = C(n+m, r). If we set m = n-1 and r = p here? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, note that C(n, p)*C(n-1, p-1) = C(n-1, p-1)*C(n, p) = C(n, p)*C(n-1, p-1). Wait, perhaps this is equal to C(2n -1, 2p -1)? Not sure. Alternatively, let's consider that choosing p elements from the first group (including the leader) and p elements from the second group. Wait, the total would be sum_{p=1}^n [C(n-1, p-1) * C(n, p)] for each leader. Then sum over p would be C(2n -1, n -1), since the total number of ways to choose (p-1) from n-1 and p from n is equivalent to choosing n-1 elements from a combined set of (n-1) + n = 2n -1 elements. Yes, because when you fix the leader, the remaining choices are (p-1) from the first group's remaining n-1 and p from the second group's n. The total number of elements selected is (p-1) + p = 2p -1, but that varies. Wait, perhaps using the identity that sum_{k} C(a, k)*C(b, c -k) = C(a + b, c). Here, if we have sum_{p=1}^n C(n-1, p-1)*C(n, p). Let m = p-1, then sum becomes sum_{m=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, m)*C(n, m + 1). Let's set k = m +1, so sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k -1)*C(n, k). Comparing to Vandermonde, this is like sum_{k} C(n-1, k-1)*C(n, k) = C(n + (n-1), k + (k -1))? Not straightforward. Alternatively, think of the sum as the coefficient of x^{k} in (1+x)^{n-1} times coefficient of x^{k} in (1+x)^n. Wait, but convolution. Alternatively, generating functions. The sum is the coefficient of x^{m} in (1+x)^{n-1} multiplied by coefficient of x^{m+1} in (1+x)^n. So the product would be the coefficient of x^{2m+1}... Hmm, not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, combinatorial interpretation: the sum C(n-1, p-1)*C(n, p) counts the number of ways to choose p-1 elements from the first n-1 and p elements from the second n. This is equivalent to choosing a total of (p-1) + p = 2p -1 elements from the combined set of (n-1) + n = 2n -1 elements. But since p varies from 1 to n, the total number would be the sum over all possible 2p -1 up to 2n -1. Wait, but this doesn't immediately simplify. Alternatively, maybe it's equivalent to choosing any subset of size n-1 from 2n -1 elements. Wait, no. Wait, C(2n -1, n -1) is the number of ways to choose n-1 elements from 2n -1. So if we fix a leader in the first group (n choices), and then choose n-1 elements from the remaining 2n -1 (which are n-1 from first group and n from the second group), then that would be n * C(2n -1, n -1), which is exactly the right side. \n\nBut how does that relate to the left side? If for each leader in the first group, choosing n-1 elements from the remaining 2n -1, perhaps these n-1 elements can be partitioned into two parts: (p-1) from the first group (excluding the leader) and p from the second group. Wait, but if you fix a leader in the first group, then the total number of people is 2n (n in first, n in second). But after choosing a leader, there are n-1 left in the first group and n in the second, total 2n -1. Choosing n-1 from these 2n -1 can be thought of as forming a committee of size n-1. But how does this committee relate to the original problem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right side counts the number of ways to choose a committee of size n with a leader. Wait, no. If you have 2n people, choosing a committee of size n with a leader would be n * C(2n -1, n -1). Because choose the leader first (2n choices), then choose n -1 from the remaining 2n -1. But the right side here is n * C(2n -1, n -1), which would correspond to choosing the leader from a subset of size n. Wait, maybe the setup is that there are two groups of size n each, say men and women. Then the right side counts selecting a leader among the men (n choices) and then selecting n-1 people from the remaining 2n -1 (which is n-1 men and n women). So the total committee has 1 leader (a man) and n-1 others. The total size is n.\n\nNow, the left side is sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n, k)^2. Let's interpret this as follows: For each k, choose a subset A of k men, a subset B of k women, and then select a leader from A. So the total is the number of triples (A, B, leader) where A and B are size k subsets, and leader is in A. Summing over k gives all possible such triples.\n\nOn the other hand, the right side counts selecting a leader among the men (n choices), then choosing n-1 people from the remaining 2n -1 (which are n-1 men and n women). This forms a committee of size n (leader + n-1 others). But how is this equivalent to the left side's counting?\n\nPerhaps there's a bijection between these two sets. Given a triple (A, B, leader) on the left, where A is a subset of men, B a subset of women, both size k, and leader is in A. To map this to the right side's structure: the leader is already chosen (part of the right side's count). Then, the committee on the right side consists of the leader plus n-1 others. But how do A and B relate to this committee?\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take the leader from the men, and then the committee must include k-1 other men (from the remaining n-1) and k women (from B), such that the total committee size is 1 + (k-1) + k = 2k. Wait, but the right side's committee size is n. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't aligning.\n\nWait, maybe another interpretation. Suppose we have a set of n men and n women. The left side counts the number of triples (A, B, l) where A is a subset of men of size k, B is a subset of women of size k, and l is a leader in A. The right side counts choosing a leader among the men and then forming a committee of size n-1 from the remaining 2n -1 people. How can these be equivalent?\n\nLet’s try to find a bijection. Suppose we have such a triple (A, B, l) on the left. The leader l is one of the men. The set A contains l and k-1 other men, and B is a set of k women. We need to map this to a committee of size n-1 (excluding the leader) selected from the remaining n-1 men and n women. So the total people available after choosing l are n-1 men and n women. The committee on the right side is n-1 people chosen from these. \n\nIf we take the elements of A excluding l (which are k-1 men) and the elements of B (k women), then together they form a subset of size k-1 + k = 2k -1. But the committee size on the right is n-1, so 2k -1 = n -1, which implies k = n/2. But k can range from 1 to n, so this only works if n is even. That doesn't seem right. So this approach might not work.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider forming a pair (A, B) where A is a subset of men, B is a subset of women, both of size k, and a leader in A. The total is sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n, k)^2. Now, instead of thinking of A and B separately, maybe think of forming a mixed committee. The leader is from the men. The rest of the committee consists of k-1 men from A and k women from B. So total committee size is 1 + (k-1) + k = 2k. But the right side's committee size is n. So unless 2k = n, which isn't necessarily the case, this doesn't align. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the right side counts selecting a leader (man) and then choosing n-1 people from the rest (n-1 men and n women). So the committee has 1 leader and n-1 others. Let's interpret this as follows: The n-1 people can include some number t of men and (n-1 - t) women, where t ranges from 0 to n-1. For each t, the number of ways is C(n-1, t) * C(n, n-1 - t). But this sum over t is equal to C(2n -1, n -1), which is correct. But how does this relate to the left side?\n\nWait, maybe the left side can be connected by considering that for each committee on the right (leader + n-1 others), we can count how many men and women are in the committee. Suppose in the committee, there are t men (including the leader) and (n - t) women. Then t can range from 1 to n (since the leader is a man). So t = k, where k ranges from 1 to n. The number of ways to choose such a committee is C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, n -k) = C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). Then sum over k from 1 to n gives C(2n -1, n -1), and multiplied by n leaders gives the right side. \n\nBut the left side is sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n, k)^2. Comparing to the right side's sum_{k=1}^n n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). So if we can show that k * C(n, k)^2 = n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). Let's check algebraically:\n\nRHS term: n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * [ (n-1)! / ((k-1)! (n -k)!)) ] * [n! / (k! (n -k)!)) ] \n\nSimplify: n * [ (n-1)! n! ) / ( (k-1)! (n -k)! k! (n -k)! )) ] = n! * n! / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) ) * n / n? Wait, perhaps better to note that C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = [C(n, k) * C(n, k)] * k / n. Because C(n-1, k-1) = C(n, k) * k / n. So substituting:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) = (n /k) * C(n-1, k-1) ??? Wait, actually, C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k). Not sure. Let me compute C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k):\n\nC(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = [ (n-1)! / ((k-1)! (n -k)! )) ] * [ n! / (k! (n -k)! )) ] \n\n= [ (n-1)! n! ) / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) ]\n\nOn the other hand, k * C(n,k)^2 = k * [ n! / (k! (n -k)! )) ]^2 \n\n= k * (n!^2) / (k!^2 (n -k)!^2 )) \n\n= (n!^2) / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nCompare with the previous expression:\n\nC(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = (n-1)! n! ) / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nBut n! = n (n-1)!, so:\n\n= (n-1)! n (n-1)! ) / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nWait, no. Wait, the numerator is (n-1)! * n! = (n-1)! * n * (n-1)! ) = n * (n-1)!^2 ). \n\nSo C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * (n-1)!^2 / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nWhereas k * C(n,k)^2 = (n!^2 ) / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nBut n! = n (n-1)!, so n!^2 = n^2 (n-1)!^2. Therefore:\n\nk * C(n,k)^2 = n^2 (n-1)!^2 / ( (k-1)! k! (n -k)!^2 )) \n\nComparing to the other expression, which is n * (n-1)!^2 / denominator. \n\nTherefore, k * C(n,k)^2 = n * [n * (n-1)!^2 / denominator] = n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n,k) * n / n? Wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a mistake in the algebra.\n\nAlternatively, note that k * C(n,k)^2 = n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). \n\nLet’s check for specific values. Let n=2, k=1:\n\nLeft: 1 * C(2,1)^2 = 1 * 2^2 = 4\n\nRight: 2 * C(1,0) * C(2,1) = 2 * 1 * 2 = 4. OK.\n\nn=2, k=2:\n\nLeft: 2 * C(2,2)^2 = 2 * 1^2 = 2\n\nRight: 2 * C(1,1) * C(2,2) = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2. OK.\n\nSo equality holds for specific cases. Therefore, general equality k * C(n,k)^2 = n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). Therefore, the left side sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n,k)^2 = sum_{k=1}^n n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). \n\nBut sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, k) * C(n, k+1) [substitute k’=k-1]. Let m = k+1, then sum becomes sum_{m=1}^n C(n-1, m-1) * C(n, m). This is the same as sum_{m=1}^n C(n-1, m-1) * C(n, m) = C(2n -1, n -1). By the Vandermonde's identity, sum_{m} C(a, m) * C(b, c -m) = C(a + b, c). Here, a = n-1, b = n, c = n -1. So sum_{m} C(n-1, m-1) * C(n, n -1 - (m-1)) ) = C( (n-1) + n, n -1 ). Wait, no. Wait, if we set m’ = m-1, then sum becomes sum_{m’=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, m’) * C(n, (n -1) - m’ +1 ) ??? Not sure. Wait, let's consider that sum_{m=1}^n C(n-1, m-1) * C(n, m). Let’s set p = m-1, then sum_{p=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, p) * C(n, p+1). This is equivalent to sum_{p=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, p) * C(n, n - (p+1)). Because C(n, p+1) = C(n, n - p -1). Then applying Vandermonde's identity, this sum is C(n-1 + n, n -1 ). Which is C(2n -1, n -1). Because the sum of C(a, k) * C(b, c -k) over k is C(a + b, c). Here, a = n-1, b = n, c = n -1. So yes, sum_{p=0}^{n-1} C(n-1, p) * C(n, n -1 - p) ) = C(2n -1, n -1). Therefore, the sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = C(2n -1, n -1). Therefore, the left side sum is n * C(2n -1, n -1), which matches the right side. Hence, the identity holds.\n\nBut the problem asks for a combinatorial proof, not algebraic. So even though the algebraic proof works, we need a combinatorial argument. From the earlier analysis, the key is to interpret both sides as counting the same thing. \n\nThe left side counts the number of triples (A, B, l) where A and B are subsets of size k from two different n-element sets, and l is a distinguished element of A. The right side counts selecting a leader from the first n-element set and then choosing n-1 elements from the combined remaining elements (n-1 from the first set and n from the second set). \n\nThe bijection is as follows: Given a triple (A, B, l), we can map it to the leader l and the committee formed by (A \\ {l}) ∪ B. The size of this committee is (k-1) + k = 2k -1. But the committee on the right side must be of size n-1. Therefore, 2k -1 = n -1 ⇒ k = n/2. This only holds if n is even, which isn't necessarily the case. Hence, this approach seems flawed.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw algebraically that the sum equals n*C(2n-1, n-1). So the combinatorial argument must hold regardless of specific k. Maybe another approach: consider forming a team with a leader and members, where the leader is from one group and the team is selected from both groups.\n\nLet’s consider two groups: Group X with n people and Group Y with n people. We want to count the number of ways to select a leader from Group X and then form a committee of size n-1 from the remaining 2n -1 people (n-1 from X and n from Y). This is the right side: n * C(2n -1, n -1).\n\nOn the left side, we count for each k, the number of ways to choose a subset A of size k from X, a subset B of size k from Y, and a leader from A. For each k, this is k * C(n, k) * C(n, k). Sum over k gives the left side.\n\nTo establish a bijection, take a triple (A, B, l) from the left side. The leader l is in A. The committee on the right side is formed by taking (A \\ {l}) ∪ B. The size of this committee is (k -1) + k = 2k -1. However, the committee on the right side has size n -1. Therefore, 2k -1 = n -1 ⇒ k = n/2. This only works if n is even, but the identity holds for all n. Hence, this bijection is invalid.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of fixing k, perhaps consider all possible k and map each triple to a leader and a committee in the right side. For any triple (A, B, l), where |A|=k, |B|=k, and l ∈ A, map it to the leader l and the committee (A \\ {l}) ∪ B. The size of the committee is k -1 + k = 2k -1. But the committee on the right side is size n -1. Therefore, we need 2k -1 = n -1 ⇒ k = n/2. But this only works if n is even, so this approach fails.\n\nThus, another angle is needed. Let's think of the right side as choosing a leader from X and then selecting n-1 people from X \\ {leader} ∪ Y. The left side involves pairs of subsets (A, B) with |A|=|B|=k and a leader in A. To relate this, note that choosing a leader and a committee of size n-1 can be decomposed based on the number of people from X and Y in the committee. Suppose in the committee, there are t people from X \\ {leader} and (n-1 - t) from Y. Then t can range from 0 to n-1. For each t, the number of ways is C(n-1, t) * C(n, n-1 - t). Summing over t gives C(2n -1, n-1). Multiply by n leaders gives the right side.\n\nBut how does this relate to the left side? For each k, k * C(n, k)^2 = C(n, k) * k * C(n, k). As earlier, k * C(n, k) = n * C(n-1, k-1). Therefore, k * C(n, k)^2 = n * C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). Sum over k gives n * sum_{k} C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * C(2n -1, n-1). So the combinatorial interpretation is that the left side counts the same as choosing a leader from X (n choices), then selecting k-1 elements from X \\ {leader} and k elements from Y, but summed over k. However, the total number of elements selected from X \\ {leader} and Y would be (k-1) + k = 2k -1. To make this equal to n -1 (the size of the committee on the right), we need 2k -1 = n -1 ⇒ k = n/2, which again only works for even n. This seems circular.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of fixing k, we consider that for any committee of size n-1 (excluding the leader), the number of men (excluding leader) and women in the committee can vary. Let’s say there are t men and (n-1 - t) women. Then t can range from 0 to n-1. The number of ways to choose such a committee is C(n-1, t) * C(n, n-1 - t). The left side's sum over k can be related to t by setting k = t +1. Wait, if k = t +1, then t = k -1. Then the number of ways would be C(n-1, k -1) * C(n, n -1 - (k -1)) = C(n-1, k -1) * C(n, n -k). But C(n, n -k) = C(n, k). So this becomes C(n-1, k -1) * C(n, k). Thus, the right side's count per leader is sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k). Hence, each term in the right side's sum corresponds to a term in the left side's sum when considering the leader fixed. Therefore, the total count on the right is n * sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * C(2n -1, n-1). But since the left side is sum_{k=1}^n k * C(n, k)^2 = n * sum_{k=1}^n C(n-1, k-1) * C(n, k) = n * C(2n -1, n-1), both sides are equal.\n\nTherefore, the combinatorial proof is based on interpreting both sides as counting the number of ways to select a leader from a group of n and then forming a committee of size n-1 from the remaining 2n-1 individuals (n-1 from the original group and n from another group). The left side groups these committees by the size of the subset from the original group (including the leader), while the right side directly computes the total using binomial coefficients.",
