    "Content": "Is $x^2 +y^2 + z^2$ irreducible in $\\mathbb C [x,y,z]$? As $(x^2+y^2+z^2)= (x+y+z)^2- 2(xy+yz+zx)$, $$(x^2+y^2+z^2)=\\left(x+y+z+\\sqrt{2(xy+yz+zx)}\\right)\\left(x+y+z-\\sqrt{2(xy+yz+zx)}\\right).$$ But how to show that none of these factors belong to $\\mathbb C [x,y,z]$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I don't quite see why you are interested in this particular square root, $\\sqrt{xy+yz+zx}$. In general, adjoining an element to a ring may or may not affect irreducibility of a given element. For example, $13$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors as $(3+2i)(3-2i)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, remains irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, factors as $(4+\\sqrt3)(4-\\sqrt3)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt3]$, remains irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt7]$ et cetera. Anyway, you can prove irreducibility of $x^2+y^2+z^2$ for example as follows.\n$\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]=\\mathbb{C}[u,v,z]$ with $u=x+iy$, $v=x-iy$. Your polynomial then looks like $x^2+y^2+z^2=uv+z^2$. If this were not irreducible, it would be a product of two linear polynomials. As this polynomial is homogeneous, so are the presumed factors. So we need to rule out the possibility\n$$\nuv+z^2=(au+bv+cz)(a'u+b'v+c'z)\n$$\nfor some constants $a,b,c,a',b',c'$. As $aa'=0$ one of those constants is zero, w.l.o.g. $a'=0$, $a\\neq0$. Similarly from $bb'=0$ we see that one of those also needs to be zero. Clearly we must assume $b=0, b'\\neq0$. This leaves us\n$$\nuv+z^2=(au+cz)(b'v+c'z)\n$$\nwith $a,c,b',c'$ all non-zero ($cc'=1$). This forces non-zero coefficients to terms $vz$ and $uz$, so no factorization is possible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking whether the polynomial \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) is irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\). They provided an attempt by factoring it as a difference of squares, resulting in two factors involving square roots. The key point is to show that these factors aren't polynomials in \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible. A polynomial is irreducible over a field if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials. So, if the given factors were polynomials, then \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) would be reducible. But since the factors include \\( \\sqrt{2(xy + yz + zx)} \\), which isn't a polynomial, the original polynomial might still be irreducible.\n\nBut the user is asking how to formally show that those factors aren't in \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\). One approach is to assume, for contradiction, that one of the factors is a polynomial. Suppose \\( x + y + z + \\sqrt{2(xy + yz + zx)} \\) is a polynomial. Then \\( \\sqrt{2(xy + yz + zx)} \\) must also be a polynomial. Let’s denote this square root as \\( P(x, y, z) \\). Then, \\( P^2 = 2(xy + yz + zx) \\). \n\nNow, \\( P \\) would have to be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 1 because \\( xy + yz + zx \\) is degree 2. So, suppose \\( P = ax + by + cz \\). Then, squaring gives \\( a^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + c^2z^2 + 2abxy + 2acxz + 2bcyz = 2xy + 2yz + 2zx \\). Comparing coefficients, we get:\n\n- \\( a^2 = 0 \\), \\( b^2 = 0 \\), \\( c^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2ab = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2ac = 2 \\)\n- \\( 2bc = 2 \\)\n\nBut if \\( a^2 = 0 \\), then \\( a = 0 \\), similarly \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\). This leads to a contradiction because then \\( 2ab = 0 \\neq 2 \\). Therefore, such a polynomial \\( P \\) doesn't exist, meaning the original factors aren't in \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\), so \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) is irreducible.\n\nAnother way to approach this is by using the concept of unique factorization domains. Since \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\) is a UFD, if the polynomial factors, it must factor into polynomials. The given factorization involves square roots, which aren't polynomials, hence the original polynomial must be irreducible.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are that we're working in the polynomial ring \\( \\mathbb{C}[x, y, z] \\), and the problem is to show that \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials. The key step is showing that the square root term isn't a polynomial, which leads to the conclusion of irreducibility.",
