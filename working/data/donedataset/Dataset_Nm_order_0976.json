    "Content": "I have a certain differential equation that includes functional derivatives . I know the solution, but I'm having a hard time to show that the equation is indeed solved by the solution. The background for this question is quantum field theory (in particular, scalar $\\phi^4$ ). The equation, called the Schwinger-Dyson equation , reads\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\delta_xF[f]-\\frac{g}{3!}\\delta_x^3 F[f]-f(x)F[f]=0\\tag{1}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_x$ is a functional derivative:\n$$\n\\delta_x\\equiv\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta f(x)}\\tag{2}\n$$\nand $F[f]$ is a functional of $f(x)$, a scalar function of $x\\in\\mathbb R^n$. Also, $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian on a certain manifold. The standard method to solve this equation is through a \"functional Fourier transform\", where we formally integrate over the space of functions (also known as functional integration ). The solution supposedly reads (cf. [1]):\n$$\nF[f]\\propto \\exp\\left[\\frac{g}{4!}\\int\\mathrm dx\\ \\delta_x^4\\right]\\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\mathrm dy\\,\\mathrm dz\\ f(y)G(y-z)f(z)\\right]\\tag{3}\n$$\nwhere $G$ is a Green function of $\\nabla^2$,\n$$\n\\nabla^2G(x)\\equiv\\delta(x)\\tag{4}\n$$ Question I know how to use the Fourier transform to solve $(1)$, and the solution is indeed $(3)$. But then I tried to plug $(3)$ back into $(1)$ and show that the equation is solved without using functional integration , and I failed. The expansion of the differential operator $\\exp\\left[\\frac{g}{4!}\\int\\mathrm dx\\ \\delta_x^4\\right]$ in power series in $g$ leads to a somewhat complicated combinatoric problem that I don't seem to be able to solve. My attempt was as follows: take $(1)$ and let us suppose that $F$ can be expanded in power series in $g$:\n$$\nF[f]=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty g^kF^{(k)}[f]\\tag{5}\n$$ Plugging this into $(1)$ and insisting that the equation is solved order by order in $g$, we get the system of equations\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla^2 \\delta_xF^{(0)}[f]-f(x)F^{(0)}[f]&=0\\\\\n\\nabla^2 \\delta_xF^{(k)}[f]-\\frac{1}{3!}\\delta_x^3 F^{(k-1)}[f]-f(x)F^{(k)}[f]&=0\n\\end{aligned}\\tag{6}\n$$ Now, the solution for $F^{(0)}$ is straightforward:\n$$\nF^{(0)}[f]\\propto \\exp\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\mathrm dy\\,\\mathrm dz\\ f(y)G(y-z)f(z)\\right]\\tag{7}\n$$ If we trust the solution $(3)$, then the solution for $F^{(k)}$ should be\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF^{(k)}[f]&\\overset?= \\left(\\frac{1}{4!}\\int\\mathrm dx\\ \\delta_x^4\\right)^kF^{(0)}[f]\\\\\n&\\overset?=\\frac{1}{4!}\\int\\mathrm dx\\ \\delta_x^4 F^{(k-1)}[f]\n\\end{aligned}\\tag{8}\n$$\nbut here I fail: there is no way I can show (say, with induction) that this indeed satisfies $(6)$. Thus, here I am. Can anyone help me to show that $(8)$ satisfies $(6)$? Thank you in advance. [1]: http://www.scl.rs/papers/QFT2notes.pdf , equation (2.23). Here the author uses functional integrals to solve the (generalised) Schwinger-Dyson equation, equation (2.12). In this post we use the notation $F[f]$ instead of $Z[J]$, and also the mass $m$ is zero to keep the analysis simple. Also, I have dropped some factors of $i$ to clean up the notation.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I think in this case, the proof that equation $(8)$ solves equation $(6)$ is indeed by induction. However, note first that there is a factor $1/k!$ (from the Taylor expansion of the exponential) missing in the first line of equation $(8)$, and a factor $1/k$ in the second line. The inductive step starts by multiplying the second line of equation $(6)$ by$$\\left({1\\over{k + 1}}\\right)\\left({1\\over{4!}} \\int dz\\,\\delta_x^4\\right)$$from the left. The first term immediately takes the desired form. The second term almost takes the desired form, but with an extra prefactor $k/(k + 1)$. The third term gives two contributions, by virtue of the product rule of (functional) differentiation. One contribution has the desired form $f(x) F^{(k + 1)}[f]$, the other one has a form similar to the second term, but with a prefactor $1/(k + 1)$ instead of $k/(k + 1)$. The two prefactors combine to $1$, bringing also the second term to the desired form.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to verify that the proposed solution (equation 3) satisfies the Schwinger-Dyson equation (equation 1) without using functional integration. They tried expanding the solution in a power series in g and checking order by order, but got stuck on the combinatorics. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question. The key components are the differential equation (1), the proposed solution (3), and the attempt to expand F[f] as a power series in g leading to equations (6). The user is struggling to show that the recursive relation (8) satisfies (6). \n\nAssumptions: Let me list out the conditions and objects involved. The problem involves functionals, functional derivatives, the Laplacian on a manifold, a Green's function for the Laplacian, and specific forms of the solution. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\n- The functional F[f] is a solution to the Schwinger-Dyson equation (1).\n- The Schwinger-Dyson equation includes terms with functional derivatives δ_x, the Laplacian ∇², a coupling constant g, and the function f(x).\n- The solution F[f] is proposed to be proportional to an exponential involving an integral of δ_x^4 and another exponential with a Green's function G.\n- G is the Green's function of ∇², satisfying ∇²G(x) = δ(x).\n- The user expands F[f] in a power series in g (equation 5) leading to recursive equations (6) for F^(k).\n- The proposed form of F^(k) in equation (8) involves applying the operator (1/4! ∫ dx δ_x^4)^k to F^(0).\n- F^(0) is the Gaussian solution given by equation (7).\n\nProblem: The user is asking to show that the proposed F^(k) in equation (8) satisfies the recursive equations in (6). The main issue is proving the induction step, i.e., assuming F^(k-1) satisfies its equation, show F^(k) as defined in (8) satisfies the next equation. The user failed to do this, likely due to combinatorial factors or how the functional derivatives interact.\n\nI need to structure this into the required format. The assumptions are all the given conditions, and the problem is to verify that (8) satisfies (6). Let me list each assumption line by line, ensuring each addresses one property of one object.",
