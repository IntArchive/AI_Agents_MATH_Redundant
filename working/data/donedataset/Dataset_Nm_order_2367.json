    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to prove that the limit of √(n+1) - √n as n approaches infinity is zero. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with limits involving square roots, especially differences like this, a common technique is to rationalize the expression. \n\nWait, how does rationalizing work here? Normally, if you have something like √a - √b, you multiply by the conjugate (√a + √b)/(√a + √b) to eliminate the square roots. Let me try that. So, take the expression √(n+1) - √n and multiply it by [√(n+1) + √n]/[√(n+1) + √n]. That should give me [(√(n+1) - √n)(√(n+1) + √n)] / [√(n+1) + √n]. The numerator simplifies to (n+1) - n, which is 1. So the whole expression becomes 1 / [√(n+1) + √n].\n\nNow, as n approaches infinity, both √(n+1) and √n go to infinity. Therefore, their sum also goes to infinity, and the denominator grows without bound. So 1 divided by something growing to infinity should approach zero. That makes sense.\n\nBut let me check if there are other methods. The user mentioned trying the Squeeze Theorem. Maybe I can find upper and lower bounds. Since √(n+1) > √n, the difference √(n+1) - √n is positive. To find an upper bound, perhaps compare it to 1/(2√n). Wait, how does that come in? Let's see. After rationalizing, we have 1/[√(n+1) + √n]. Since √(n+1) > √n, the denominator is greater than 2√n. Therefore, 1/[√(n+1) + √n] < 1/(2√n). And since 1/(2√n) approaches zero as n approaches infinity, by the Squeeze Theorem, the original expression also approaches zero.\n\nAlternatively, using the Mean Value Theorem. Let f(x) = √x. Then, √(n+1) - √n = f'(c) for some c between n and n+1. The derivative f'(c) = 1/(2√c). As n approaches infinity, c is between n and n+1, so c also approaches infinity, making f'(c) approach zero. Thus, the difference approaches zero.\n\nBut the simplest method is probably rationalizing. The problem is straightforward once you apply that technique. The key assumptions here are that n is approaching infinity and that the operations involved (like rationalizing) are valid for all n in the natural numbers. The problem doesn't state any specific constraints on n, so we assume n is a positive integer going to infinity. There's no need for additional conditions like divisibility as in the previous example. So structuring the problem as per the required format, the assumption is just that n approaches infinity, which is inherent in the limit statement. The problem is to prove the limit is zero. Wait, but in the example given, assumptions were specific conditions. However, in the original problem here, there are no extra assumptions; the user just needs to prove the limit. Maybe the assumption here is simply that n is a natural number approaching infinity. But the example included an assumption like \"n is divisible by 7\" when the problem required it. In this case, since the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, the main assumption is that n is an integer approaching infinity. But the original example's assumption listed specific conditions. Hmm, perhaps in this case, the problem doesn't have any specific assumptions beyond the natural context of the limit. Maybe the assumption is just that n is a positive integer. Let me check the example again. The original example had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but in the problem, the user had to prove divisibility by 91, which factors into 7 and 13. So maybe the example was a modified problem where the original problem required n to be divisible by 7, perhaps. But in the current problem, the user's original question doesn't have any such conditions. So for the structured format, the assumption would be that n is an integer approaching infinity. But maybe in the problem as posed, the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, so perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond what's in the problem statement. Wait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the original problem here, the limit is as n approaches infinity, which is standard in calculus, where n is typically a natural number or real number. However, since the expression involves √n, n must be non-negative. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive real number approaching infinity. But the original example's assumption included \"n is an integer\" because the problem was about divisibility. In this case, since the problem is about a limit, perhaps the assumption is that n is a real number approaching infinity, but in many contexts, n is an integer. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption? Or perhaps not, since limits as n approaches infinity typically assume n is an integer unless stated otherwise. Wait, but in calculus, when you take the limit as n approaches infinity, n is often considered to be a real variable unless specified as discrete. However, in sequences, n is an integer. Since the problem is about √(n+1) - √n, it's more natural as a sequence, where n is an integer. So the assumption would be that n is a positive integer. However, the problem statement doesn't specify that n is an integer, but the original example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, to follow the example's structure, perhaps we should list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require any specific assumptions beyond the standard context. Hmm. The problem is to structure it according to the example. The example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem statement, like \"n is an integer\" was in the original problem, but the formatted problem listed it as an assumption. Wait, looking at the example: the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"$n$ is an integer\". So similarly, here, the original problem says \"lim_{n\\to\\infty}\", which implies n is approaching infinity, but the question is about the limit, which in standard terms assumes n is a natural number (since it's a sequence). So perhaps the assumption here is that \"n is a positive integer\". Alternatively, if the problem doesn't specify, maybe there are no explicit assumptions. But the example included \"n is an integer\" even though it was part of the problem statement. So following that, perhaps we should list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption here. But let me check the example again. The original example's problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, and in the formatted problem, the assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it's \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, and adds \"n is divisible by 7\" which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like the example might have been modified. Wait the user says:\n\nExample:\nOriginal problem:\nProve that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems like the example might have been altered. Maybe the user made a mistake in the example? Because the original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nIn any case, the user wants to structure the problem by listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in the current problem, the original question is: Prove that the limit of sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) as n approaches infinity is zero. The problem is about a limit of a sequence (since it's n going to infinity, typically integers), so the assumptions would be that n is a positive integer approaching infinity. However, in the example, the assumption included n being an integer even though it was stated in the original problem. So following that pattern, here, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\", even though it's implied by the limit notation. Additionally, maybe there are other assumptions, but in this problem, there's no restriction. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is a positive integer. Alternatively, maybe there's no need for assumptions beyond what's in the problem, but according to the example, even if it's part of the problem statement, we list it. So here, the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, so the assumptions are:\n\n- n is a positive integer,\n- n approaches infinity.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were properties of n, like being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, \"n approaches infinity\" is part of the limit, not an assumption on n. So perhaps the only assumption here is that n is a positive integer. Alternatively, maybe there's no need for any assumptions beyond the problem statement. Wait, but the problem statement is \"Prove that the limit...\", which includes the fact that n approaches infinity. So maybe the assumption is just that n is a positive integer. Because the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity, which is part of the problem, not an assumption. But according to the example, they extracted \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even though it was stated in the problem. So following that, here, we can list \"n is a positive integer\" as an assumption. But the original problem doesn't explicitly state that n is an integer; it's implied by the notation lim_{n\\to\\infty}, which in the context of sequences, n is an integer. So perhaps the assumption is that n is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sqrt{n+1} - \\sqrt{n} = 0.$$\n\nBut let's check the example again. The original problem in the example was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", and the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer\". Here, the problem is \"Prove that the limit...\", which is about n approaching infinity, typically over integers. So if we follow the example's approach, the assumption would be \"n is a positive integer\". However, in the example, the user added an extra assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake in the example. Maybe the example was a modified problem where the user intended to have additional assumptions. But given that, perhaps in the current problem, there are no additional assumptions beyond what's necessary. Therefore, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, as the problem is about the limit of a sequence. Alternatively, if we consider that the problem is about the limit as n approaches infinity in the real numbers, then n is a real variable, but the expression sqrt(n+1) - sqrt(n) is defined for real n >= 0. However, in the context of the problem, since it's phrased similarly to a sequence limit, n is likely an integer. But the problem doesn't specify. Therefore, to list assumptions, maybe we should include that n is a positive real number, but that's inherent in the square roots. Alternatively, perhaps no explicit assumptions are needed beyond the problem statement. However, following the example's structure, where \"n is an integer\" was listed as an assumption even if it's part of the problem, we should do the same here. So:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left( \\sqrt{n+1} - \\sqrt{n} \\right) = 0.$$\n\nBut the original problem didn't specify that n is an integer; it's just a limit as n approaches infinity. In calculus, limits as n approaches infinity can be over real numbers or integers. However, since the expression involves sqrt(n), which is defined for real n >=0, but the problem is likely intended as a sequence limit, hence n is an integer. Therefore, the assumption is n is a positive integer. Alternatively, if we take n as a real variable, the limit still holds. But in either case, the key is to structure the problem. The example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption even if it's in the problem statement. So following that, we list it here. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
