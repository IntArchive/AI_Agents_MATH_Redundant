    "Content": "If one iterates the squaring: $$5^2 = 25, 25^2 = 625, 625^2 = 390625 $$ one quickly notices that the end digits become 'stable', i.e. however far you take the above procedure, the result will always end in $...90625.$ The resulting 'limit' is a so-called $10$ -adic number. What's also interesting is that the following procedure also leads to a stable 'limit': $$2^5 = 32, 32^5 = 33554432\\dots$$ and if one multiplies the resulting $10$ -adics, one gets $0$ . After similar experiments, it seems that iterating $p^q$ and $q^p$ modulo $pq$ leads to pq-adic inverses $pq$ -adic numbers with product 0. How can this be shown? It feels  like this should follow easily from something like Fermat's little theorem or the CRT but I can't immediately see how to prove this.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "I saw this observation in a math book once when I was 16 or so and was totally baffled at the time. It's nice to know I understand it now! As you say, the starting point is to use CRT, which allows us to write $\\mathbb{Z}_{10} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ , so we can work in the $2$ -adics and $5$ -adics separately. It's easy to understand what happens to the powers of $5$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ : they converge to zero. Similarly for the powers of $2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ . The tricky question is about the powers of $5$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the powers of $2$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ . Here, as you also say, the starting point is that by Fermat's little theorem we have $x^p \\equiv x \\bmod p$ . So at least the first digit $\\bmod p$ stabilizes. What can we say about taking further iterations $\\bmod p^2, p^3$ , etc.? Theorem (existence of the Teichmuller character ): Let $p$ be a prime and let $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p$ . The sequence $x, x^p, x^{p^2}, \\dots$ converges and its limit $\\omega(x)$ , the Teichmuller character of $x$ , is the unique solution to $\\omega(x)^p = \\omega(x)$ which is congruent to $x \\bmod p$ . Proof. This sequence always lies in the subspace $S_x$ of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ consisting of elements congruent to $x \\bmod p$ . It suffices to show that on this subspace, the Frobenius map $F(x) = x^p$ is a contraction in the $p$ -adic metric so we can apply the Banach fixed point theorem . In other words, we want to show that there exists some constant $c < 1$ such that for all $a, b \\in S_x$ we have $$|a^p - b^p|_p \\le c |a - b|_p.$$ This follows from a contest math result called lifting the exponent although we won't need its full strength so we can settle for only part of the proof. Since by assumption $a \\equiv b \\bmod p$ , we can argue as follows: write $$\\frac{a^p - b^p}{a - b} = a^{p-1} + a^{p-2} b + \\dots + b^{p-1}.$$ This sequence has $p$ terms and each term is congruent to $a^{p-1} \\equiv b^{p-1} \\bmod p$ , so their sum is congruent to $0 \\bmod p$ . So $a^p - b^p$ is divisible by at least one more power of $p$ than $a - b$ is, which means the Frobenius map is a contraction with $c = p^{-1}$ . Applying the Banach fixed point theorem we conclude that the sequence $x, F(x), F^2(x), \\dots $ converges to a unique fixed point $\\omega(x)$ in $S_x$ : this means precisely that $\\omega(x) \\equiv x \\bmod p$ and $\\omega(x)^p = \\omega(x)$ and that $\\omega(x)$ is unique with respect to these two properties. (Alternatively this existence and uniqueness result can also be deduced from Hensel's lemma.) $\\Box$ This means that the Teichmuller character provides a canonical splitting of the map $\\mathbb{Z}_p^{\\times} \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^{\\times}$ on groups of units, allowing us to construct the $(p-1)^{th}$ roots of unity in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ surprisingly explicitly. Applying the theorem, we get: The sequence $5, 5^2, 5^4, \\dots $ converges in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ to the unique solution to $\\omega(5)^2 = \\omega(5)$ congruent to $1 \\bmod 2$ , which is $1$ . In other words, the sequence converges in $\\mathbb{Z}_{10} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ to $(1, 0)$ , which is precisely the idempotent projecting from $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ down to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ . The sequence $2, 2^5, 2^{25}, \\dots$ converges in $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ to the unique solution to $\\omega(2)^5 = \\omega(2)$ congruent to $2 \\bmod 5$ , which is one of the two primitive $4^{th}$ roots of unity. In other words, the sequence converges in $\\mathbb{Z}_{10} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5$ to an element you might call $(0, i)$ . Now we of course have $(1, 0) \\cdot (0, i) = (0, 0)$ . The fun part is that if we take the fourth power of $(0, i)$ , getting the limit of the sequence $16, 16^5, \\dots$ , we get $(0, 1)$ , which is the idempotent projecting from $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ down to $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ , and it satisfies $(0, 1)^2 = (0, 1)$ and $(0, 1) + (1, 0) = (1, 1)$ ; in other words, if we know the digits of $(1, 0) = \\dots 90625$ we can compute the digits of $(0, 1)$ by just subtracting from $1$ , which gives $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 16^{5^n} = \\dots 09376 = 1 - \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 5^{2^n}$$ and you can check this on a calculator! What this says in other words is that these two limits, which somewhat abusing notation I'll call $\\omega(5)$ and $\\omega(16)$ , give a canonical decomposition of any $10$ -adic number into two components $$x = \\omega(5) x + \\omega(16) x$$ where the first component is $5$ -adically zero and gives the $2$ -adic component of $x$ and the second component is $2$ -adically zero and gives the $5$ -adic component of $x$ . (You may be familiar with a certain explicit proof of CRT that constructs idempotents like these to show, for example, that $5x + 6y$ is an explicit number congruent to $x \\bmod 2$ and $y \\bmod 5$ ; this construction gives a compatible family of such idempotents $\\bmod 10^n$ for all $n$ .)",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the user is talking about iterating exponentials modulo pq and ending up with pq-adic numbers whose product is zero. Hmm, I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention squaring 5 repeatedly, which stabilizes the trailing digits, leading to a 10-adic number. Similarly, raising 2 to the 5th power repeatedly gives another 10-adic number, and multiplying them results in zero. The user then generalizes this to iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq, leading to pq-adic inverses with product zero.\n\nThe key here is probably related to properties of p-adic and q-adic numbers, but since it's about pq-adic numbers, maybe the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is involved. Also, Fermat's Little Theorem might come into play since exponents are related to primes.\n\nLet me parse the problem statement again. The main points are:\n\n1. Iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq leads to pq-adic numbers.\n2. These pq-adic numbers are inverses? Wait, the user says \"inverses\" but maybe they meant \"inverse\" in some sense, or perhaps they meant inverses of each other? Or maybe they're additive inverses? But the product is zero, so maybe they are orthogonal in some way.\n\nWait, the example given with 2 and 5: multiplying the resulting 10-adics gives zero. So, perhaps each of these sequences converges to a number in the pq-adic integers such that their product is zero. For 10-adics, 2 and 5 are prime factors, so 2*5=10. So, maybe in general, for pq-adic numbers constructed this way, their product is zero modulo pq?\n\nBut how does the iteration of p^q and q^p lead to such numbers? Let's think about the example with 5^2. Each iteration squares the previous number. So starting with 5, then 25, then 625, etc. Each time, the last n digits stabilize. Similarly, starting with 2^5=32, then 32^5=33554432, which ends with 32, and so on. The resulting 10-adic numbers are ...90625 and ...33554432. When multiplied, they give zero. So in the 10-adic ring, these two elements are zero divisors, and their product is zero.\n\nThis is because 10 is composite, and in the ring of 10-adic integers, there are zero divisors. Specifically, any pair of numbers that are congruent to 0 mod 2 and 0 mod 5 respectively will multiply to 0 mod 10. So maybe the sequences generated by iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq converge to elements that are divisible by p and q respectively, hence their product is divisible by pq, making it zero in the pq-adic integers.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's consider the iterative process. For the first sequence, starting with p, then raising to q each time modulo pq. Wait, in the example, they start with 5 and square it (since q=2 for the first part). Wait, p=5, q=2? But in the problem statement, they mention iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nIn the example, for 10-adics, p=5 and q=2. Then they iterate p^q: 5^2=25, then 25^2=625, etc. Similarly, iterate q^p: 2^5=32, then 32^5=33554432, etc. So each iteration is taking the previous result and raising it to the power of q or p respectively. Then, the resulting pq-adic numbers (10-adic here) multiply to zero.\n\nSo, generalizing, if we have two primes p and q, then iterating p^q modulo pq, then the result to q again modulo pq, etc., gives a sequence converging to a pq-adic number x. Similarly, iterating q^p modulo pq gives a pq-adic number y. Then x*y = 0 in the pq-adic integers.\n\nTo show this, perhaps we can show that x ≡ 0 mod p and y ≡ 0 mod q, hence x*y ≡ 0 mod pq. But since in the pq-adic integers, being 0 mod pq for each component would make the product zero. Wait, but in the example, x is ...90625, which is 0 mod 5 (since it ends with 5) but not necessarily 0 mod 2. Similarly, y is ...32, which is 0 mod 2 but not mod 5. However, their product is 0 mod 10, so each term in the product is 0 mod 10. Wait, but ...90625 * ...32 = ...0, which is 0 mod 10^n for all n, hence 0 in the 10-adics.\n\nWait, but in the 10-adic numbers, the product is zero because each digit in the product is zero. For example, multiplying ...90625 * ...32:\n\nThe last digit is 5*2=10 → 0 mod 10.\n\nThe next digit: 2*2 + 5*3 = 4 +15=19, plus carryover 1 from the previous digit (10/10=1) → 20 → 0 mod 10, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to think that each term in the sequences x_n and y_n (truncated to n digits) satisfies x_n * y_n ≡ 0 mod 10^n. Then, in the limit, x*y ≡ 0 mod 10^n for all n, hence x*y=0 in the 10-adics.\n\nSimilarly, for general pq, if we can show that x_n ≡ 0 mod p and y_n ≡ 0 mod q, then x_n * y_n ≡ 0 mod pq. But wait, pq divides x_n * y_n, so x_n * y_n ≡ 0 mod pq. But we need this for each modulus 10^n, but here pq may not be 10. Wait, no, in the general case, we're working modulo pq. Wait, the problem is about pq-adic numbers, which are inverse limits of modulo (pq)^n. So each x_n is in Z/(pq)^n Z, and similarly for y_n. Then, if x_n * y_n ≡ 0 mod (pq)^n, then their product in the pq-adic integers would be zero.\n\nBut how does iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq lead to such sequences where x_n * y_n ≡ 0 mod (pq)^n?\n\nLet me try with the example. For x_n = 5^{2^{n}} mod 10^n. Wait, but in the example, they square each time: 5^2=25, then square again to get 625, etc. So each step is squaring, which is raising to the power of 2 each time. Similarly, the other sequence is raising to the 5th power each time: 2^5=32, then 32^5=33554432, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the iteration is not just exponentiation, but each step is taking the previous result and raising it to the power of q (for the p sequence) and to the power of p (for the q sequence). So, for the first sequence, starting with p, then each term is previous term^q mod pq. Similarly, the second sequence starts with q, then each term is previous term^p mod pq.\n\nWait, in the example, starting with 5 (p=5, q=2), then next term is 5^2=25, then 25^2=625, etc. So indeed, each term is previous term^q. Similarly, starting with 2 (q=2, p=5), then 2^5=32, then 32^5=33554432, etc. So each term is previous term^p.\n\nTherefore, the general process is:\n\nFor primes p and q:\n\n- Define a sequence a_n where a_0 = p, and a_{k+1} = a_k^q mod pq.\n\n- Define a sequence b_k where b_0 = q, and b_{k+1} = b_k^p mod pq.\n\nThen, the sequences a_k and b_k converge to pq-adic numbers a and b, respectively, and a*b=0 in the pq-adic integers.\n\nTo prove that a*b=0, need to show that for every n ≥ 1, a_n * b_n ≡ 0 mod (pq)^n.\n\nAlternatively, since the pq-adic numbers are inverse limits, it's sufficient to show that at each level n, a_n * b_n ≡ 0 mod (pq)^n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more straightforwardly, show that a ≡ 0 mod p and b ≡ 0 mod q, so their product is 0 mod pq, but since this needs to hold at every level, maybe through induction.\n\nWait, but in the example, a_n is 5^{2^n} mod 10^n. Let's check for n=1: 5^2=25 mod 10 → 5. Wait, no, mod 10: 5^2=25 mod 10 is 5. Then 5^2=25 mod 10^2=100 is 25. Then 25^2=625 mod 1000 is 625, etc. So each a_n is 5^{2^n} mod 10^n.\n\nSimilarly, b_n is 2^{5^n} mod 10^n.\n\nThen, a_n * b_n mod 10^n would be 5^{2^n} * 2^{5^n} mod 10^n. We need to show this is 0 mod 10^n.\n\nBut 10^n = 2^n * 5^n. So, to show that 5^{2^n} * 2^{5^n} ≡ 0 mod 2^n * 5^n.\n\nBut 5^{2^n} has at least n factors of 5, since 2^n ≥ n for n ≥ 1 (since 2^1=2 ≥1, 2^2=4 ≥2, etc.). Similarly, 2^{5^n} has at least n factors of 2, since 5^n ≥ n for n ≥1.\n\nTherefore, 5^{2^n} is divisible by 5^n, and 2^{5^n} is divisible by 2^n, so their product is divisible by 5^n * 2^n = 10^n. Hence, a_n * b_n ≡0 mod 10^n.\n\nThus, in general, for primes p and q, consider sequences a_k = p^{q^k} mod (pq)^n and b_k = q^{p^k} mod (pq)^n. Then, for each n, as k increases, a_k stabilizes once k is sufficiently large (due to the 10-adic convergence). Then, a_n * b_n would be p^{q^n} * q^{p^n} mod (pq)^n.\n\nBut p and q are primes, so p^{q^n} is divisible by p^{n} if q^n ≥n, which is true for q ≥2 and n ≥1. Wait, but q is prime, so q ≥2. Therefore, q^n ≥2^n ≥n for all n≥1 (by induction: 2^1=2≥1, assume 2^k ≥k+1, then 2^{k+1}=2*2^k ≥2(k+1) ≥k+2 since k≥1). Hence, p^{q^n} is divisible by p^n. Similarly, q^{p^n} is divisible by q^n. Therefore, their product is divisible by p^n * q^n = (pq)^n. Hence, a_n * b_n ≡0 mod (pq)^n. Therefore, in the inverse limit, the product is zero.\n\nTherefore, the key idea is that raising p to the q^k power gives a number divisible by p^k, and similarly for q raised to p^k, so their product is divisible by (pq)^k. Hence, in the limit, their product is zero.\n\nBut to formalize this, perhaps use induction on n to show that for each n, a_n * b_n ≡0 mod (pq)^n.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in the sequences, after sufficient iterations, the exponents become large enough to ensure the divisibility.\n\nAnother angle: using the lifting the exponent lemma (LTE) or properties of exponents in modular arithmetic. But maybe simpler to observe that for each modulus (pq)^n, the terms p^{q^k} and q^{p^k} will eventually (for k ≥n) be congruent to 0 mod p^n and q^n respectively, hence their product is 0 mod (pq)^n.\n\nAlternatively, since in the pq-adic integers, the sequence a_k converges to an element a such that a ≡ p^{q^k} mod (pq)^{k+1}, and similarly for b. But maybe this is complicating.\n\nIn summary, the problem reduces to showing that for each n, after sufficiently many iterations, the sequences a and b satisfy a_n ≡0 mod p^n and b_n ≡0 mod q^n, hence their product is 0 mod (pq)^n. This would follow from the fact that each iteration increases the exponent, leading to higher divisibility by p and q respectively.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would involve the iterative processes defined for primes p and q, exponentiating each time, and the convergence in the pq-adic integers. The problem is to show that the product of these two pq-adic numbers is zero.\n\nNow, structuring the problem according to the user's format:\n\nAssumptions need to be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem mentions iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq leading to pq-adic inverses with product zero. The key assumptions would be:\n\n- p and q are primes (since the example uses 2 and 5, which are primes).\n- The iteration process for the sequences: starting with p, then repeatedly raising to the power q modulo pq; similarly for q.\n- The sequences converge to pq-adic numbers (which requires the stabilization modulo (pq)^n for each n).\n- The product of these two pq-adic numbers is zero.\n\nBut the user's example formatted the problem with assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by 7\". So in this case, the assumptions might be:\n\n- p and q are distinct primes.\n- Iterating the function x → x^q modulo pq starting from p yields a pq-adic number X.\n- Iterating the function y → y^p modulo pq starting from q yields a pq-adic number Y.\n- The product X*Y is a pq-adic number.\n\nBut the original problem states that \"iterating p^q and q^p modulo pq leads to pq-adic inverses with product 0\". Wait, the term \"inverses\" here is confusing. In the example, multiplying them gives zero, so they are zero divisors, not inverses. Maybe it's a mistranslation or typo. The user probably meant that they are zero divisors.\n\nGiven that, the assumptions would be about the iteration process and the primes. So:\n\nAssumption:\np and q are distinct primes,\nThe iteration of x ↦ x^q modulo pq starting from p converges to a pq-adic number X,\nThe iteration of y ↦ y^p modulo pq starting from q converges to a pq-adic number Y,\nX and Y are pq-adic numbers.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the product X*Y is equal to zero in the pq-adic integers.\n\nAlternatively, if \"inverses\" was intended, but since the product is zero, they can't be multiplicative inverses. So probably a mistranslation, and the correct term is \"zero divisors\".\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have assumptions about p and q being primes, the iteration processes, and the convergence to pq-adic numbers. The problem is to show their product is zero.",
