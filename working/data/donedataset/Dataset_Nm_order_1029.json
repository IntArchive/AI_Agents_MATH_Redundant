    "Content": "If $p$ and $q$ are nonnegative numbers such that\n$\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{q}=1$ and if $f \\in L^p$ and $g \\in L^q$, then $f\\cdot g \\in L^1$ and\n$$\\int |fg| \\leqslant ||f||_p \\cdot ||g||_q$$ I think Hölder's inequality is derived in order to prove Minkowski's inequality, which is a generalization of triangle inequality to $L^p$ norm. But is there any intuitive understanding of Hölder's inequality? It's hard for me to remember it. It seems that it's a generalization of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, trying to compare $L^2$ inner product to norm, but the power of each term is different, which makes it harder to be understood compared with Minkowski inequality.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hölder's inequality is an attempt to generalize the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to other Lebesgue exponents (other $L^p$ norm). In fact, for inequality of the form\n$$ \\|fg\\|_1 \\leq \\|f\\|_p \\|g\\|_q$$\nto be true, we must have $1/p+1/q=1$. To see this, we use scaling argument, which is also useful to verify the correct exponent for other type of inequalities (Sobolev inequalities, etc.). If such inequality were true, then we could apply the inequality to functions $f(\\lambda x)$ and $g(\\lambda x)$ for $\\lambda\\in \\mathbb{R}$ to get\n$$ \\|fg\\|_1 \\leq \\lambda^{n(1-1/p-1/q)} \\|f\\|_p \\|g\\|_q$$\nwhich cannot be true for all $\\lambda$ unless $1/p+1/q=1$. This is a way to see that indeed the correct exponents must be such that $1/p+1/q=1$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the Math Stack Exchange question about Hölder's inequality into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the main problem. \n\nThe original question starts by stating Hölder's inequality: given p and q are nonnegative numbers with 1/p + 1/q = 1, and functions f in L^p and g in L^q, then f*g is in L^1 and the integral of |fg| is less than or equal to the product of the p-norm of f and q-norm of g. The user is asking for an intuitive understanding or a way to remember Hölder's inequality, relating it to Cauchy-Schwarz and Minkowski's inequality.\n\nSo, the assumptions here are the conditions given in Hölder's inequality. Each assumption should be listed line by line. Let's break them down:\n\n1. p and q are nonnegative real numbers (since they are exponents in the context of Hölder's inequality, they should be positive to avoid division by zero, but the problem states nonnegative, so I'll stick with that).\n2. The exponents satisfy 1/p + 1/q = 1. This is the conjugate condition.\n3. The function f belongs to L^p space, meaning it has a finite p-norm.\n4. The function g belongs to L^q space, similarly with finite q-norm.\n\nThe problem part is the conclusion of Hölder's inequality, which is that the product f*g is in L^1 and the integral inequality holds. But the actual user's question isn't to prove Hölder's inequality but to understand or remember it intuitively. However, the example provided in the original query was about structuring the problem's assumptions and the problem statement. The user's task here might be to present Hölder's inequality as the problem to understand, given those assumptions. But the example given by the user was a problem to prove something given certain assumptions. Here, the Stack Exchange question is more about understanding the inequality rather than proving it. However, the formatting example was about a problem to prove. So perhaps the \"problem\" part here should be the statement of Hölder's inequality, and the user's actual question (about intuitive understanding) isn't part of the formatted problem but the original question's content. Wait, looking back at the instructions:\n\nThe task is to structure the problem as per the format, which includes Assumption and Problem. The example took the original problem statement, extracted assumptions, and restated the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So they filtered out the necessary conditions.\n\nIn the current case, the original problem is a question about understanding Hölder's inequality, but the problem statement to structure would be the Hölder's inequality itself. So the user wants to extract the assumptions of Hölder's inequality and present the inequality as the problem to prove or state. The user's actual question (how to understand it) is part of the original post but not part of the formatted problem. So the formatted problem should be the statement of Hölder's inequality with its assumptions.\n\nSo, the Assumptions would be:\n\n- p and q are nonnegative numbers such that 1/p + 1/q = 1.\n\n- f is in L^p.\n\n- g is in L^q.\n\nProblem: Prove that f * g is in L^1 and that the integral of |fg| is less than or equal to the product of the p-norm of f and q-norm of g.\n\nBut wait, the original Hölder's inequality statement includes both conclusions: fg is in L^1 and the inequality. So both are part of the problem statement. The example given by the user had the problem to prove the expression is divisible by 91, which is the conclusion. So here, the problem is to prove that under the assumptions, fg is in L^1 and the inequality holds.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have the assumptions listed as each condition, and the problem is to prove those two conclusions.\n\nLet me check the original question again:\n\n\"If p and q are nonnegative numbers such that 1/p +1/q=1 and if f ∈ L^p and g ∈ L^q, then f⋅g ∈ L^1 and ∫|fg| ⩽ ||f||_p ||g||_q\"\n\nSo the problem here is to prove those two conclusions. The user's actual question is about understanding it, but for formatting purposes, the problem is the statement of Hölder's inequality.\n\nTherefore, the Assumptions are:\n\n- p and q are nonnegative numbers.\n\n- 1/p + 1/q = 1.\n\n- f ∈ L^p.\n\n- g ∈ L^q.\n\nProblem: Prove that f⋅g ∈ L^1 and ∫|fg| ⩽ ||f||_p ||g||_q.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were split into separate lines. Each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"p and q are nonnegative numbers\" is one assumption. Then \"1/p +1/q =1\" is another. Then \"f ∈ L^p\" and \"g ∈ L^q\" as separate lines.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final formatted problem would have those four assumptions, each on their own line, and the problem is to prove the two conclusions.",
