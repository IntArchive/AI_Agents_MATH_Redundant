    "Content": "I've been using the sentence: If a series converges then the limit of the sequence is zero as a criterion to prove that a series diverges (when $\\lim \\neq 0$) and I can understand the rationale behind it, but I can't find a formal proof . Can you help me?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Yes. $$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left ( \\sum_{k = 1}^{n + 1} a_k - \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_k \\right ) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_{n + 1} $$\nAnd both sums will converge to the same number so the limit is zero. This is by far the easiest proof I know. This is the Cauchy criterion in disguise by the way, so you could use that too.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure a Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about proving that if a series converges, then the limit of its sequence is zero. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The example given shows that each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. The problem here is about the implication of a series converging on its sequence's limit. \n\nThe main assumption here is that the series converges. The series is made up of terms, which form a sequence. So the series converging is the primary condition. The problem then is to prove that the limit of the sequence (the terms of the series) is zero. \n\nWait, in the example provided, the assumptions included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in this case, the problem is more straightforward. The user mentioned using the fact that if a series converges, then the limit of the sequence is zero as a criterion. They want a formal proof of this statement. \n\nSo the only assumption here is that the series converges. There's no additional condition on the sequence other than being the terms of a convergent series. The problem is to show that under this assumption, the limit of the sequence must be zero. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user is asking for the proof of the statement: If a series converges, then the limit of its terms is zero. So the key elements are the series' convergence (assumption) and the conclusion about the sequence's limit (problem). \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that the series converges, and the problem is to prove that the limit of the sequence is zero. Each part should be listed as per the format. Let me check the example again to ensure alignment.\n\nIn the example, assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property. Here, there's only one assumption: the series converges. So the formatted version should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the limit of the sequence is zero.\n\nWait, but in the example, they used mathematical notation. Maybe I should phrase the assumption more formally. The series in question is the sum of the sequence a_n, so maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe series ∑_{k=1}^∞ a_k converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that lim_{n→∞} a_n = 0.\n\nYes, that's more precise. The example used mathematical expressions for the assumptions as well. So structuring it that way would be better. Also, the problem statement in the example used LaTeX for the expression, so following that here is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final formatted problem should have the assumption that the series converges, and the problem is to prove that the limit of the sequence terms approaches zero.",
