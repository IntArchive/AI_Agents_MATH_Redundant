Remark: There are better \"non-induction\" ways. For example, imagine expanding each of $(3+\\sqrt{5})^n$ and $(3-\\sqrt{5})^n$, using the Binomial Theorem. Now add.  The terms in odd powers of $\\sqrt{5}$ cancel.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The original question is about proving by induction that the number \\( u_n = (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\) is an integer. They mentioned trying induction but getting stuck with the messy algebra involving the term \\( \\sqrt{5}((3+\\sqrt{5})^n - (3-\\sqrt{5})^n) \\).\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original problem and extract the assumptions. The problem states that \\( u_n \\) is defined as the sum of those two binomial terms. The user is using induction, so the assumptions would include the base case and the inductive step. But according to the example provided, the assumptions should list conditions applied to one object each.\n\nLooking at the example, the assumptions were that \\( n \\) is an integer and divisible by 7. In this current problem, the key points are:\n\n1. \\( u_n \\) is defined as \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n2. The proof method is mathematical induction.\n3. The inductive step requires showing that if \\( u_n \\) is an integer, then \\( u_{n+1} \\) is also an integer. However, the user is stuck on handling the cross term involving \\( \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the properties of \\( n \\). Here, the problem is about the structure of \\( u_n \\). The main assumption here is the definition of \\( u_n \\), and perhaps the induction hypothesis. However, according to the example, the assumptions should be listed as properties or conditions on the objects involved. Since the problem is to prove that \\( u_n \\) is an integer for all integers \\( n \\geq 0 \\) (assuming induction starts at some base case), perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer (since induction typically starts at n=0 or n=1).\n- The definition of \\( u_n \\) as given.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the user didn't specify any restrictions on \\( n \\), just \"for all n\". However, in induction proofs, we usually consider \\( n \\) being an integer starting from the base case. So the key assumptions here would be:\n\n1. \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer (assuming induction starts at n=0 or n=1).\n2. \\( u_n \\) is defined as \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n\nBut the user's problem didn't mention any divisibility conditions, just the general induction. The original problem's title says the number is an integer, so the assumption is that \\( n \\) is an integer (likely non-negative since exponents are defined for all integers, but for induction, we start from a base case). The problem is to prove that this expression is an integer for all such \\( n \\).\n\nSo structuring the assumptions:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer,\n- \\( u_n \\) is defined as \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n\nProblem: Prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included the divisibility condition. Here, the original problem doesn't have any such condition except the definition and the induction method. However, the user's progress mentions they assumed it holds for \\( n \\) (induction hypothesis) and tried to show for \\( n+1 \\), but got stuck on the term with \\( \\sqrt{5} \\). However, in the problem statement, should the induction hypothesis be part of the assumptions? Probably not, because the problem is to perform the induction, which inherently uses the hypothesis. So the assumptions are the given conditions, not the steps in the proof.\n\nSo the problem as per the original title and question is to prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer. The key given is the definition of \\( u_n \\), and the fact that \\( n \\) is an integer (non-negative, typically for induction). Therefore, the structured problem should list:\n\nAssumption:\n- \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer,\n- \\( u_n = (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n\nProblem: Prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer.\n\nBut let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (divisible by 7) even though the user's problem didn't mention it. Wait, no, the example's original problem was to prove for every integer \\( n \\), but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, no, looking back: the example's original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, the original example says:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, that seems like a mistake. If the original problem is for every integer n, then the formatted problem's assumption should not include \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, maybe there was a misunderstanding. Wait, in the example, the original problem is to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions are n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that's contradictory. Unless the original problem had a typo or the example is wrong. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's assumed n is divisible by 7, that's adding an extra condition. So perhaps the example is incorrect. But maybe the original problem had a hidden condition, like the user in the example made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example is illustrative but not accurate. Therefore, I need to proceed carefully.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is to prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer. The assumptions are that \\( n \\) is an integer (probably non-negative) and the definition of \\( u_n \\). The problem is to prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer.\n\nSo following the example's structure, even if the example might be flawed, the current task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThus, the assumptions would be:\n\n- \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer,\n- \\( u_n = (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n\nProblem: Prove by induction that \\( u_n \\) is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the original problem doesn't specify non-negative, but just \"for every integer n\", but induction typically starts at a base case, so maybe n is a positive integer. However, the original problem's title just says \"the number is an integer\", so probably for all integers n ≥ 0 or n ≥ 1. The exact base case might be part of the induction proof.\n\nBut the user's problem statement doesn't specify, so the assumptions should be as per the original problem. The original problem's title says \"The number ... is an integer\", so the problem is for all n (implied where the expression is defined). Since exponents are defined for any integer n, but for induction, we usually start at n=0 or n=1. However, without loss of generality, the key assumptions are n is an integer and the definition of u_n.\n\nBut in the example, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem included \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. However, maybe the example was a different problem where the user actually had to assume divisibility by 7. Maybe there was confusion in the example.\n\nBut regardless, for the current problem, the key is to extract assumptions from the original question. The original question says \"Prove by induction that this number is an integer: u_n = ...\". So the assumptions are:\n\n1. \\( n \\) is an integer (for which the induction is being performed, typically non-negative integers).\n2. \\( u_n \\) is defined as \\( (3+\\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\\sqrt{5})^n \\).\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem accordingly.",
