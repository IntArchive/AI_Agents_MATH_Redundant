    "Content": "I'm having some (hopefully small) issues computing the norm of an operator. Firstly, the problem, For $f\\in L^\\infty[0,1]$, define $M_f: L^2[0,1]\\to L^2[0,1]$ by $M_f(g)(x) = f(x)g(x)$. Show that $M_f$ is a bounded linear operator and $\\|M_f\\| = \\|f\\|_\\infty$. What I've done so far: To see that $M_f$ is linear, let $g_1,g_2\\in L^2[0,1]$ and $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Then\n$$ M_f(g_1 + \\lambda g_2)(x) = f(x)(g_1(x) + \\lambda g_2(x)) = f(x)g_1(x) + \\lambda f(x)g_2(x) = M_f(g_1)(x) + \\lambda M_f(g_2)(x).$$ As $f\\in L^\\infty$ we know there is some minimal $N\\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq N$ almost everywhere (i.e., $\\|f\\|_\\infty = N \\lt \\infty$). The fact that $M_f$ is bounded comes straight this assupmtion, as\n$$ \\|M_f\\| = \\sup \\frac{\\|fg\\|_2}{\\|g\\|_2} \\leq \\sup \\frac{\\|Ng\\|_2}{\\|g\\|_2} = N\\sup \\frac{\\|g\\|_2}{\\|g\\|_2} = N < \\infty.$$\nalmost everywhere in $[0,1]$, for all non-zero $g\\in L^2[0,1]$. So $M_f$ is a bounded linear operator on $L^2[0,1]$. To prove equality, we must show there is some $g\\in L^2[0,1]$ so that $\\frac{\\|fg\\|_2}{\\|g\\|_2} = N$. Now I want to say something along the lines of pick $g = 1$, but this won't have $\\|g\\|_2 = 1$ for all measures, so this won't work. Is there any simple way of picking a $g$ that does what we want? Or am I farther off than I'm expecting? Thanks!",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "Hint: Fix $\\varepsilon > 0$ and $S_{\\varepsilon} := \\{ x \\in [0,1] \\; \\colon \\; |f(x)| \\geqslant N - \\varepsilon \\}$. Take $g$ to be $\\chi_{S_{\\varepsilon}}$, the indicator function of the set $S_{\\varepsilon}$. Fleshed out answer. We will prove that $\\| M_f \\| \\geqslant N-\\varepsilon$ for all $\\varepsilon > 0$. Fix $\\varepsilon > 0$ (s.t. $\\varepsilon < N$) and set $$S_{\\varepsilon} := \\{ x \\in [0,1] \\; \\colon \\; |f(x)| \\geqslant N - \\varepsilon \\} .$$ Finally, define $g$ by \n$$\ng(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1, &x \\in S_{\\varepsilon}, \\\\\n0, &\\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n(The definition of $N$ implies that $g$ differs from zero in a positive measure set.)

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to show that the norm of the multiplication operator \\( M_f \\) on \\( L^2[0,1] \\) is equal to the essential supremum norm \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\) of the function \\( f \\). \n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions. The operator norm \\( \\|M_f\\| \\) is defined as the supremum of \\( \\|M_f(g)\\|_2 \\) over all \\( g \\) in \\( L^2[0,1] \\) with \\( \\|g\\|_2 = 1 \\). So we need to show that this supremum is exactly \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\).\n\nThe user already established that \\( M_f \\) is a bounded linear operator and that \\( \\|M_f\\| \\leq \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). The key part left is to show the reverse inequality, that \\( \\|M_f\\| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). \n\nTo do this, we need to find a function \\( g \\) in \\( L^2[0,1] \\) such that \\( \\|fg\\|_2 / \\|g\\|_2 \\) is close to \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). The user mentioned trying \\( g = 1 \\), but that's not in \\( L^2[0,1] \\) if the measure is not finite. Wait, no, on [0,1], the function 1 is actually in \\( L^2 \\) because the integral of 1^2 over [0,1] is 1, which is finite. So maybe they thought it's not, but actually it is. However, using \\( g = 1 \\) would give \\( \\|fg\\|_2 = \\|f\\|_2 \\), which isn't necessarily equal to \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). So that might not work.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the essential supremum \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\) is the smallest number \\( N \\) such that \\( |f(x)| \\leq N \\) almost everywhere. So for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the set where \\( |f(x)| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon \\) has positive measure. Let's call this set \\( E_\\epsilon \\). Then, we can choose \\( g \\) to be the characteristic function of \\( E_\\epsilon \\), normalized in \\( L^2 \\). \n\nLet me verify this. The characteristic function \\( \\chi_{E_\\epsilon} \\) has \\( L^2 \\) norm equal to the square root of the measure of \\( E_\\epsilon \\). Then, \\( \\|fg\\|_2 \\) would be the integral over \\( E_\\epsilon \\) of \\( |f(x)|^2 \\), which is at least \\( (\\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon)^2 \\) times the measure of \\( E_\\epsilon \\). Therefore, \\( \\|fg\\|_2 / \\|g\\|_2 \\) is at least \\( (\\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon) \\sqrt{\\mu(E_\\epsilon)} / \\sqrt{\\mu(E_\\epsilon)}} = \\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon \\). Taking \\( \\epsilon \\) to 0, we can show that the operator norm is at least \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\).\n\nBut wait, does this hold? Because as \\( \\epsilon \\) approaches 0, the measure of \\( E_\\epsilon \\) might approach zero, but the key point is that for each \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the set \\( E_\\epsilon \\) has positive measure. So by choosing such a \\( g \\), even if the measure is small, the ratio \\( \\|fg\\|_2 / \\|g\\|_2 \\) would still be at least \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon \\). Since \\( \\epsilon \\) is arbitrary, this would show that the operator norm is at least \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\).\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to construct a sequence of functions \\( g_n \\) such that \\( \\|fg_n\\|_2 / \\|g_n\\|_2 \\) approaches \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). The characteristic functions of the sets where \\( |f(x)| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty - 1/n \\) would work here.\n\nBut let's make sure that these sets \\( E_\\epsilon \\) are measurable. Since \\( f \\) is in \\( L^\\infty \\), it's measurable, so the preimage of \\( [\\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon, \\infty) \\) under \\( |f| \\) should be measurable. Hence, \\( E_\\epsilon \\) is measurable.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the measure of \\( E_\\epsilon \\) is positive. By the definition of essential supremum, the measure of the set where \\( |f(x)| > \\|f\\|_\\infty \\) is zero, but for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the set where \\( |f(x)| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon \\) must have positive measure. Otherwise, \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\) would be smaller, which contradicts its definition. Therefore, such \\( E_\\epsilon \\) indeed has positive measure.\n\nTherefore, by taking \\( g_\\epsilon = \\chi_{E_\\epsilon} / \\sqrt{\\mu(E_\\epsilon)} \\), which is normalized in \\( L^2 \\), we get \\( \\|fg_\\epsilon\\|_2 \\geq (\\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon) \\|g_\\epsilon\\|_2 \\). Thus, \\( \\|M_f\\| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty - \\epsilon \\) for all \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), so \\( \\|M_f\\| \\geq \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). Combining with the earlier inequality, we have equality.\n\nBut let's see if the user considered this approach. The user mentioned picking \\( g = 1 \\), which as I thought earlier, actually is in \\( L^2[0,1] \\), but \\( \\|fg\\|_2 \\) is the \\( L^2 \\) norm of \\( f \\), which is not necessarily the same as the \\( L^\\infty \\) norm. So perhaps the user was on the wrong track there. The correct approach is to use characteristic functions of sets where \\( f \\) is close to its essential supremum.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to approximate \\( f \\) by simple functions. But since \\( f \\) is already in \\( L^\\infty \\), maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo summarizing, the key assumptions here are that \\( f \\) is in \\( L^\\infty[0,1] \\), the operator \\( M_f \\) is defined by multiplication, and we need to show the operator norm equals \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). The problem structure requires listing all assumptions, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The original problem mentions that \\( f \\in L^\\infty[0,1] \\), defines the operator \\( M_f \\), and asks to show that it's bounded with operator norm equal to \\( \\|f\\|_\\infty \\). The user's question is about constructing the appropriate \\( g \\).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should include that \\( f \\) is in \\( L^\\infty[0,1] \\), \\( M_f \\) maps \\( L^2 \\) to \\( L^2 \\), linearity, and the problem is to show the operator norm equals the essential supremum.",
