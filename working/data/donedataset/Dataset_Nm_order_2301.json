    "AcceptedAnswer": "[Deleting previous answer, and starting over.] This is a special case of a more general result (which I suspect must be known, but wasn't terribly difficult to derive independently) about when the endpoints of three concurrent segments lie on a conic (are \"co-conicear\"?). Proposition. Suppose six distinct points, $P_0$, $P_1$, $P_2$, $Q_0$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$ are such that the lines $P_i Q_i$ are distinct and concur at a distinct seventh point, $R$. Write $p_i := \\pm|RP_i|$, $q_i := \\pm|RQ_i|$, and $\\theta_i = \\angle P_{i-1}RP_{i+1}$; for each $i$, we assign $p_i$ and $q_i$ opposite signs if $R$ is between $P_i$ and $Q_i$, and identical signs otherwise. (The $p_i$ and $q_i$ cannot be zero, nor equal.) Then, those six points lie on a common conic if and only if $$ \\sum_i \\left(\\frac{1}{p_i}+\\frac{1}{q_i}\\right)\\sin\\theta_i = 0$$ Proof. Take $R$ to be the origin, and assign coordinates to the points: $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\nP_0 = p_0 (1, 0) \\hspace{0.25in} P_1 = p_1(\\cos\\phi_1, \\sin\\phi_1) \\hspace{0.25in} P_2 = p_2 (\\cos\\phi_2,\\sin\\phi_2)\\\\\nQ_0 = q_0 (1, 0) \\hspace{0.25in} Q_1 = q_1(\\cos\\phi_1, \\sin\\phi_1) \\hspace{0.25in} Q_2 = q_2 (\\cos\\phi_2,\\sin\\phi_2)\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ Substitute the coordinates into the conic template $A x^2 + 2 B xy + Cy^2 + 2 D x + 2 Ey + 1 = 0$ to get a system of six equations in five unknown coefficients. (Note that any such conic will not pass through the origin, or $R$ in the general context.) A computer algebra system helps to determine that the system imposes a dependency among the $p_i$, $q_i$, and $\\theta_i$ ---for instance, evaluating the determinant in equation (8) of MathWorld's \"Conic Section\" entry , with the sixth point's coordinates entered into the top row--- that dependency can be expressed as the summation above, with (taking $\\phi_0 := 0$) $\\sin\\theta_i := \\sin(\\phi_{i+1}-\\phi_{i-1})$. Note that our assumptions provide that $p_i \\ne 0$, $q_i \\ne 0$, $p_i \\ne q_i$, and that $\\sin\\theta_i\\ne 0$. To the problem at hand ... The Proposition is clearly relevant, since pairs of a triangle's \"sub-incenters\" determine three segments that concur at the triangle's incenter. We just have to figure out the lengths and angles involved to run the \"co-conicearity test\". First, some notation: Let $\\triangle ABC$ have incenter $I$, and let $N_A$, $N_B$, $N_C$ be the points where angle bisectors $AI$, $BI$, and $CI$ meet sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. (If you consult the first figure in MathWorld's \"Incircle\" entry , my $N$s are close to their $M$s ... which is why I chose \"$N$\" to denote them.) Let $P_{AB}$ be the incenter of $\\triangle IAN_C$; the \"$AB$\" indicates that the triangle lies along $A$'s end of side $AB$. Likewise, let $P_{BC}$ and $P_{CA}$ be the incenters of $\\triangle IBN_A$ and $\\triangle ICN_B$; and let $Q_{BA}$, $Q_{CB}$, $Q_{AC}$ be the incenters of $\\triangle IBN_C$, $\\triangle ICN_A$, and $\\triangle IAN_B$. (The concurrent segments are then $P_{CA}Q_{BA}$, $P_{AB}Q_{CB}$, $P_{BC}Q_{AC}$.) Because $AI$, $BI$, and $CI$ bisect vertex angles, and each $P_\\star I$ and $Q_\\star I$ bisects an angle at $I$, finding (the sines of) the angles between segments is straightforward, as shown below. Note. To save space, I write \"$\\theta_n$\" for \"$\\frac{\\theta}{n}$\". Observe that $\\alpha_n+\\beta_n+\\gamma_n = \\pi_n$. $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sin\\angle P_{BC}IP_{CA} &=& \\sin(\\angle BIN_B - \\angle BIP_{BC} - \\angle N_B IP_{CA} \\\\\n&=& \\sin\\left( \\pi - \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BIN_A - \\frac{1}{2}\\angle CIN_B \\right) \\\\\n&=& \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha_2+\\beta_2)+\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_2+\\beta_2)\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\alpha_4 + 2\\beta_4+\\gamma_4\\right) \\\\\n&=& \\sin\\left( \\pi_4 + \\beta_4 \\right)\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ For the length information, we need to formulate the distance from a triangle's incenter to one of its vertices. Let $\\triangle ABC$ have edge lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ (in the standard arrangement), and let $d$ be the triangle's circumdiameter (which of course, satisfies $d = \\frac{a}{\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{b}{\\sin\\beta}=\\frac{c}{\\sin\\gamma}$). Invoke the Law of Sines in $\\triangle IBA$, and manipulate appropriately, to get the following $$|IA| = \\frac{|AB|\\sin\\angle IBA}{\\sin(\\pi-\\angle IBA-\\angle IAB)} = \\frac{c\\sin\\beta_2}{\\sin(\\alpha_2+\\beta_2)} = \\frac{d\\sin\\gamma\\sin\\beta_2}{\\cos\\gamma_2}= 2 d \\sin\\beta_2\\sin\\gamma_2$$ (The use of the circumdiameter makes the symmetry clear.) We want to apply that formula to, say, $\\triangle IAN_C$, which has incenter $P_{AB}$. Within this triangle, the angles at $A$ and $N_C$ are, respectively $\\alpha_2$ and (from looking at $ACN_C$) $\\pi-\\alpha-\\gamma_2=\\pi_2+\\beta_2-\\alpha_2$. The circumdiameter is $$d_{AB} = \\frac{|IA|}{\\sin\\angle N_C} = \\frac{2d\\sin\\beta_2\\sin\\gamma_2}{\\sin(\\pi_2+\\beta_2-\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{2d\\sin\\beta_2\\sin\\gamma_2}{\\cos(\\beta_2-\\alpha_2)}$$ and we can compute $$|IP_{AB}| = 2 d_{AB} \\sin\\frac{\\alpha_2}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\pi_2+\\beta_2-\\alpha_2}{2} = \\frac{4d\\sin\\alpha_4 \\sin\\beta_2\\sin\\gamma_2\\sin(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)}{\\cos(\\beta_2-\\alpha_2)}$$ That's a little ugly. If we conveniently scale $\\triangle ABC$ so that $d\\sin\\alpha_2\\sin\\beta_2\\sin\\gamma_2=1$, then we have $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n|IP_{AB}| &=& \\frac{2\\sin(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)}{\\cos\\alpha_4\\cos(\\beta_2-\\alpha_2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\left( \\cos(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)+\\sin(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)\\right)}{\\cos\\alpha_4 \\left( \\cos^2(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)-\\sin^2(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)\\right)} \\\\\n&=& \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\cos\\alpha_4 \\left(\\cos(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)-\\sin(\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\alpha_4\\cos\\left(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-\\alpha_4\\right)}\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ Recall that the co-conicearity test requires reciprocating these lengths; convenient, indeed! All we need to do now is compute the terms from the test's sum. With $I$ indisputably separating members of each $PQ$ pair, we know to assign opposite signs to the corresponding segment lengths, giving this factor $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{1}{|IP_{AB}|}-\\frac{1}{|IQ_{CB}|} &=& \\cos\\alpha_4 \\cos(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-\\alpha_4)-\\cos\\gamma_4\\cos(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-\\gamma_4) \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\cos(\\pi_4-2\\alpha_4+\\beta_4)-\\cos(\\pi_4+\\beta_4-2\\gamma_4)\\right) \\\\\n&=& -\\sin(\\pi_4-\\alpha_4+\\beta_4-\\gamma_4)\\sin(\\gamma_4-\\alpha_4)\\\\\n&=& -\\sin\\beta_2 \\sin(\\gamma_4-\\alpha_4)\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ so that $$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\left( \\frac{1}{|IP_{AB}|}-\\frac{1}{|IQ_{CB}|} \\right) \\sin\\angle P_{BC}IP_{CA} &=& -\\sin\\beta_2 \\sin(\\gamma_4-\\alpha_4)\\sin(\\pi_4+\\beta_4) \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{2} \\sin\\beta_2 \\left( \\sin\\gamma_2 - \\sin\\alpha_2 \\right)\n\\end{eqnarray*}$$ (The utter simplicity here makes me think that my approach has ignored a Putnamian insight.) Clearly, the Proposition's cyclic sum vanishes, so that the six sub-incenters lie on a common conic. Verification that the conic is, specifically, an ellipse is --for now-- left to the reader.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to structure this problem correctly. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format with Assumptions and Problem. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The title is \"The Ellipse Problem - finding an ellipse inside a triangle.\" The question states: A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nWait, the example given in the instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem here, the example might not have explicit numerical assumptions but rather geometric conditions.\n\nSo, the task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Let me parse the problem.\n\nThe main object is a triangle. The problem states that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Then, we need to prove that the intersections (probably the incenter or something else) of the angle bisectors of each smaller triangle lie on an ellipse.\n\nAssumptions here might be:\n\n1. The original triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. So, the angle bisectors are drawn, and they divide the triangle into six smaller triangles.\n\n2. For each of these smaller triangles, consider their angle bisectors. The intersections of these angle bisectors (probably the incenters of each smaller triangle) must lie on an ellipse.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- There exists a triangle.\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n- For each smaller triangle, their angle bisectors are considered.\n- The intersections (i.e., incenters) of these angle bisectors for each smaller triangle are points to be considered.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user needs to extract the assumptions from the problem. However, in the problem statement, it's given that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. That is part of the problem's premise. So that's an assumption. Then, the problem is to prove that the intersections (which would be the incenters of the smaller triangles) lie on an ellipse.\n\nWait, angle bisectors intersect at the incenter, right? So for each smaller triangle, their angle bisectors intersect at their respective incenters. So the problem is to prove that these six incenters lie on an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- There is a triangle.\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its three angle bisectors.\n- Each smaller triangle has three angle bisectors which intersect at a point (their incenter).\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points (incenters) lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\" So each smaller triangle's angle bisectors intersect at a point (the incenter), and all those points lie on an ellipse.\n\nSo the structured format should list assumptions step by step:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- There exists a triangle.\n\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. (This is given in the problem statement.)\n\n- Each smaller triangle has three angle bisectors. (This is inherent because each is a triangle, so angle bisectors exist.)\n\n- The intersections of the angle bisectors of each smaller triangle are considered. (These are the incenters.)\n\nProblem: Prove that these six intersection points lie on an ellipse.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumptions were specific, like n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Here, in the geometry problem, the assumptions are more about the construction. So the key assumptions from the problem statement are:\n\n1. A triangle is given.\n\n2. The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\n3. For each smaller triangle, consider the intersections of their angle bisectors (i.e., their incenters).\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut the problem statement as given is: \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\"\n\nSo, the user wants me to break down the assumptions. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- There exists a triangle.\n\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\n- Each smaller triangle has three angle bisectors.\n\n- The intersections of the angle bisectors of each smaller triangle are considered (i.e., the incenters of each smaller triangle).\n\nBut perhaps the first two points are sufficient as assumptions. The other points might be inherent. Alternatively, the problem might not have more assumptions beyond what's stated. The problem says \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\"\n\nSo, the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The original triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles via its angle bisectors. (So, the angle bisectors are drawn, creating six smaller triangles.)\n\n- Each of these six smaller triangles has their own angle bisectors. (Which is naturally true because they are triangles.)\n\n- The intersections (incenters) of these angle bisectors for each smaller triangle are the points in question.\n\nBut maybe the problem is simply:\n\nAssumption: A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut according to the example, they listed each assumption line by line. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- There is a triangle.\n\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\n- Each smaller triangle's angle bisectors intersect at a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points lie on an ellipse.\n\nYes, that's better. Each assumption is one line. The first line states the existence of a triangle. The second line states the dissection via angle bisectors. The third line states that each smaller triangle's angle bisectors meet at a point (which is true for any triangle, but maybe needs to be stated as an assumption here). However, in reality, angle bisectors of a triangle always meet at the incenter, so that's a property, but the problem might assume that.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the problem structured as per the example. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". So the user split the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. So the first assumption is that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Then, each of these smaller triangles has angle bisectors, which intersect at points. The problem is to prove that those points lie on an ellipse.\n\nSo following the example's structure, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\n- Each smaller triangle has three angle bisectors.\n\n- The angle bisectors of each smaller triangle intersect at a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points lie on an ellipse.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement already includes the first part. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut according to the example, they broke down even the implicit conditions. For example, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split it into two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Here, maybe the implicit assumption is that angle bisectors of each smaller triangle intersect at a point (since they are triangles). But since the problem states \"the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles\", it's implied that each such triangle's angle bisectors meet at a point, which is standard for triangles.\n\nBut maybe the user wants explicit listing of each assumption. So:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A triangle exists.\n\n- The triangle is divided into six smaller triangles by its three angle bisectors.\n\n- Each smaller triangle is a triangle (so has three angle bisectors).\n\n- Each of the smaller triangles' angle bisectors intersect at a point (their incenter).\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut maybe the key is to only list what's given in the problem statement. The original problem says \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut the example included multiple assumptions even when the original problem was a single statement. The example had the original problem stating \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Wait, the original problem in the example was: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem changed it to n is an integer, n divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, original problem was: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. But in the formatted problem, they changed the assumption to n is an integer and n divisible by 7, but that's not the original problem. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Because 91 is 7*13. So if the problem is to prove for every integer n, then the divisibility by 91 would require that it's divisible by both 7 and 13 for any n. But the formatted problem added \"n divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. So maybe the example was wrong. But I shouldn't get stuck on that. The user provided the example as such, so we need to follow the structure even if the example may have errors.\n\nIn that example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts the problem. Maybe the user intended to show how to extract assumptions even if the original problem is more general. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nExample: Original problem: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\n\nWait, in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem changed it to assuming n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless there was a misinterpretation. Maybe the user wanted to filter out some conditions? But in any case, I need to follow the structure as per the example given by the user. So in the example, even though the original problem was for all integers n, the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer, n divisible by 7, and then the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But 91 is 7*13, so maybe the original problem actually required n divisible by 7 and 13? But that's not indicated. Hmm. It's possible that the example had a mistake, but the user wants the current problem structured similarly.\n\nIn the current problem, the original problem states: \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\"\n\nFollowing the example's approach, the assumptions should be broken down into individual conditions. The example broke down \"for every integer n\" into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even though the original problem didn't state the latter. So maybe in the current problem, the user wants to split the given conditions into separate lines. The given condition is \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\" So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- There exists a triangle.\n\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles.\n\n- The dissection is done by the triangle's angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nAlternatively, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\" can be broken into:\n\n- The triangle has three angle bisectors.\n\n- The three angle bisectors dissect the triangle into six smaller triangles.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the original problem's assumption is that the triangle is divided into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors, which is a single condition. So in the example, the original problem had a condition \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually changed the problem. So perhaps the user wants to list all the conditions, even if they are not explicitly stated but necessary for the problem.\n\nBut in the current problem, the only given condition is that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The original triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nThen, the problem is to prove that the intersections (incenters) lie on an ellipse. But the problem statement includes that the intersections are of the angle bisectors of each smaller triangle. So maybe we need to state that each smaller triangle has angle bisectors that intersect at a point. But since all triangles have angle bisectors that meet at the incenter, this is a property of triangles, not an assumption. So perhaps the only assumption is the original triangle's dissection.\n\nBut following the example, which included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\", even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", it's possible that the user wants to list all necessary conditions as assumptions, even implicit ones.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- There exists a triangle.\n\n- The triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\n- Each smaller triangle is a triangle (so they have angle bisectors).\n\n- The angle bisectors of each smaller triangle intersect at a point.\n\nProblem: Prove that these six points lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut maybe this is overcomplicating. The problem states that the triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors. So that is the main assumption. The rest follows from the properties of triangles. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nBut according to the example, even if the original problem said \"for every integer n\", they split into two assumptions. So maybe here, the assumption is split into two parts:\n\n- The original triangle is divided into six smaller triangles.\n\n- The division is done by the original triangle's angle bisectors.\n\nBut I think that's unnecessary. The problem states the division is done by the angle bisectors. So the assumption is as given.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n\n- A triangle is dissected into six smaller triangles by its angle bisectors.\n\nProblem: Prove that the intersections of the angle bisectors of each of these smaller triangles lie on an ellipse.\n\nThis seems correct. Each assumption line addresses one property (dissection into six triangles via angle bisectors), applied to one object (the original triangle). The problem is to prove the six incenters lie on an ellipse.",
