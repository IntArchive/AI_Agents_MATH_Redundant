    "Content": "A quadratic equation of the form $x^2+bx+c=0$ can be solved with the classical formula that gives all solutions. Here I want discuss some other methods to find one solution. The best known is by means of continued fraction .\nIn this case, from the given equation we find:\n$$\nx^2+bx+c=0\n\\Rightarrow\nx+b+\\dfrac{c}{x}=0\n\\Rightarrow\nx=-b-\\dfrac{c}{x}\n\\Rightarrow\nx=-b+\\cfrac{-c}{-b+\\cfrac{-c}{-b+\\ddots}}\n$$\nBut there are at least other two methods: Solving for $x^2$ the given equation we find\n$$\nx^2=-bx-c \n\\Rightarrow\nx=\\pm\\sqrt{-c-bx}\n\\Rightarrow\nx=\\sqrt{-c\\mp b\\sqrt{-c\\mp b\\sqrt{-c\\mp \\dots}}}\n$$\nthat is a solution in form of infinite nested radicals . And solving for $x$ we find:\n$$\nx=\\dfrac{1}{b}\\left( -c-x^2 \\right)\n\\Rightarrow\nx=\\dfrac{1}{b}\\left(-c-\\dfrac{1}{b}\\left(-c-\\dfrac{1}{b}\\left(-c \\cdots\\right)^2\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\nthat is a solution in form of infinite nested squares . These methods cannot give all the two solutions, but only an approximation of one of these.\nThe method of continued fraction is well studied and documented in its limits and potentialities ( here ), but for the other methods I found little or nothing on the Web. I have done some numerical experiment with a spreadsheet (see the figure for $x^2-3x-4=0 $), and it seems the methods works (with some care for the nested radicals where we have to be careful for the signs). From these experiments I see that the method of nested radicals gives the root that has the greatest absolute value ( as the continued fraction), and the method of continued squares seems that gives the lowest absolute value solution, with a convergence rate that seems not so different than for continued fractions.\nI'm interested to know if we can prove that this is always true and if there are some general results about these methods. My final interest is to know if such methods can be extended to the solution of higher degree equations.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is an interesting observation.\nLet us first address the problem of convergence. Convergence of the nested radical formula For the nested radical formula, we have\n\\begin{align}\nx_{n+1}^2 = -c -b \\, x_{n}.\n\\end{align}\nThis means, around the solution $x^*$, we have\n\\begin{align}\n2 \\, x_{n+1} \\, \\Delta x_{n+1}\n\\approx\n-b \\, \\Delta x_{n},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\Delta x_n \\equiv x_n - x^*$.\nIn other words, after a round of iteration, the error is reduced by a factor of\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{b}{2\\,x_{n+1}} \\right|\n\\approx\n\\left| \\frac{b}{2\\,x^*} \\right|.\n$$\nThis means the nested radical formula works only if\n$$\n|x^*| > \\frac{|b|}{2}.\n$$ Convergence of the nested square formula The nested square formula is the opposite, we can similarly show from\n\\begin{align}\nx_{n+1} = -\\frac{c+x_{n}^2}{b},\n\\end{align}\nthat around the solution $x^*$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{ \\Delta x_{n+1} }\n{ \\Delta x_n }\n\\approx\n-\\frac{ 2 \\, x_n }{b}\n\\approx\n-\\frac{ 2 \\, x^* }{b},\n\\end{align}\nwhich means it only works for\n$$\n|x^*| < \\frac{|b|}{2}.\n$$ Comparison of the convergence of the two formulas This explains your observation that the nested radical formula often works for the larger root and the nested square formula works for the smaller root.\nIn fact the nested radical formula works at least for one of the roots, for\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{2 \\, x^*}{b} \\right|\n=\n\\left| 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4c}{b^2}} \\right|.\n$$\nNow with the plus sign, we always have $|x^*| > |b|/2$.  Further if\n$$\n-c > \\frac 3 4 \\, b^2,\n$$\nit works for both roots.\nFor example if $b=-1, c=-2$, with roots $x_1 = 2$, and $x_2 = -1$, the nested square formula works for both roots:\n\\begin{align}\n2 &= +\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\cdots}}}, \\\\\n-1 &= -\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}},\n\\end{align} Conversely, it means that the nested square formula works for at most one root, if\n$$\n-c < \\frac{3}{4} \\, b^2,\n$$\nwhich is, fortunately, your case, with $b = -3, c = -4$. The nested square formula is actually a variant of the logistic map or a general quadratic map , which is a model of studying chaos.  So maybe not the best formula for convergence. Convergence of the continued fraction method For the continued fraction formula, we have\n\\begin{align}\nx_{n+1} = -b -\\frac{c}{x_n},\n\\end{align}\nand, around the solution $x^*$, we have\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta x_{n+1}\n\\approx\n\\frac{c}{ x_n^2} \\, \\Delta x_{n},\n\\end{align}\nwith the rate of convergence being\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{c}{x_{n}^2} \\right|\n\\approx\n\\left| 1 + \\frac{b \\, x^*}{c} \\right|^{-1}.\n$$\nThis means the continued fraction formula works only if\n$$\n-\\frac{c}{b \\, x^*} < \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nor, equivalently, with $1/x^* = (-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4c})/(2c)$, we have\n$$\n1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4 \\, c}{b^2} } < 1.\n$$\nSo there is precisely one root (with the minus sign) that satisfies this condition. Generalization to higher-order polynomial equations This method is useful for numerically solving higher-order polynomial equations, although I don't suppose it is new.  For example, for\n$$\nx^7 - 3 \\, x + 1 = 0,\n$$\nthe nested radical formula $x = \\sqrt[7]{3x-1}$ is definitely a convenient way of solving it.  But it usually works for the largest root.  For example, for\n$$\nx^7 - 2 \\, x^6 + 1 = 0\n$$\nthe formula $x = \\sqrt[7]{2 \\, x^6 - 1}$ does not converge to the root $x = 1$, because there is a larger root $x \\approx 1.98358$.  And, for\n$$\n2 \\, x^7 + 2 \\, x^6 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThe formula $x = \\sqrt[7]{\\frac 1 2 -x^6}$ does not converge at all. Improving the convergence We can improve the convergence.  Take the nested radical formula for example.  For a suitable value of $d$, we have\n$$\nx_{n+1} + \\epsilon = \\sqrt{-c + d^2 - (b - 2 \\epsilon) \\, x_n},\n$$\nThis formula is convergent if $|x^*| > |b/2 - \\epsilon|$. So if we can make $\\epsilon$ close to $b/2$, the nest radical formula will almost always be convergent.\nIndeed if $\\epsilon = b/2$, this becomes the exact formula, and no iteration is needed. We mention in passing that if rapid convergence is the aim, also please consider series acceleration methods .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to parse the original question and identify the key assumptions and the main problem.\n\nThe original question is about different methods to solve quadratic equations, specifically focusing on continued fractions, nested radicals, and nested squares. The user is asking whether it's always true that the nested radical method gives the root with the greatest absolute value and the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest, and if there are general results about these methods. They also want to know if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nNow, I need to filter out unrelated information. The example given in the formatted problem included assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7\". So, for this problem, I should list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the problem, the quadratic equation is x² + bx + c = 0. The methods discussed are continued fractions, nested radicals, and nested squares. The assumptions here might relate to the convergence of these methods and the roots they approximate. However, the user hasn't specified any particular conditions on b and c, except that the equation is quadratic. The problem is more about the behavior of these methods in general.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which was part of the original problem. However, in the current problem, the user doesn't mention specific conditions on the coefficients, but rather the methods themselves. The assumptions here might be implicit, like the existence of real roots, or convergence criteria for the nested expressions. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state these, so I need to check if there are any explicit assumptions made by the user.\n\nThe user mentions that the methods \"cannot give all the two solutions, but only an approximation of one of these.\" They also note that from their experiments, the nested radicals give the root with the greatest absolute value, and nested squares give the one with the lowest. The question is whether this is always true and if there are general results, plus extension to higher degrees.\n\nSo, possible assumptions could be:\n\n1. The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has real roots. (Because if the roots are complex, the nested radicals might not be real numbers.)\n2. The methods of continued fractions, nested radicals, and nested squares converge to a solution.\n3. The nested radical method approximates the root with the greatest absolute value.\n4. The nested squares method approximates the root with the lowest absolute value.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if these assumptions (points 3 and 4) are always true. So they are not stating them as given, but asking for proof. Therefore, the actual assumptions would be the conditions under which these methods work, such as the quadratic equation having real roots, or convergence criteria.\n\nHowever, the original problem doesn't explicitly list assumptions. The user is more presenting observations and asking for validation. Therefore, the assumptions might be inherent in the problem setup: that it's a quadratic equation, that the methods are applied as described, and that convergence occurs.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about quadratic equations, so perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The equation is quadratic: x² + bx + c = 0.\n- The equation has real roots (since the methods are used to approximate them).\n- The iterative methods (continued fractions, nested radicals, nested squares) converge to a solution.\n\nWait, but the user's question is whether the methods always yield the largest or smallest absolute value roots. So perhaps the problem is under the assumption that the methods converge, and the question is about which root they converge to.\n\nBut the user hasn't stated any specific constraints on b and c, so maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has two distinct real roots.\n- The iterative methods (nested radicals and nested squares) converge to a solution.\n\nBut since the user is asking if it's always true that nested radicals give the largest root and nested squares the smallest, the problem is to prove this under general conditions. Therefore, the assumptions would include the convergence of the methods and the existence of real roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented without specific assumptions beyond the quadratic equation, and the user is asking under what conditions these methods work and which root they find.\n\nBut according to the format example, the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. In the example, n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So perhaps here:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The quadratic equation is x² + bx + c = 0.\n- The equation has two real roots.\n- The method of nested radicals converges to a solution.\n- The method of nested squares converges to a solution.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state these assumptions. The user is asking if certain properties hold (which root is found) and if there are general results. So perhaps the assumptions are inherent in the problem setup. But since the example extracted specific conditions from the problem, maybe here the assumptions are:\n\n- The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has real roots.\n- The nested radical method converges.\n- The nested squares method converges.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state these; it's part of the question. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to determine under what conditions these methods converge and which root they approximate. But since the user is asking whether it's always true that the methods give the largest/smallest absolute value roots, the problem is to prove that under the assumption that the methods converge, they do so to those roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumptions are just the setup: quadratic equation, and the problem is as posed.\n\nIn the example, the original problem had an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, wait, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumption was that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that might have been a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Because the original problem didn't have that assumption. So maybe that example is wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The example given by the user might have an error. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. Formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the formatted assumptions added an extra condition that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems like a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, and the user is expecting me to follow that format even if it's erroneous. Alternatively, maybe the example is correct, and I need to see why.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption. For example, if 91 is 7*13, then to be divisible by 91, the expression must be divisible by both 7 and 13. If the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which would imply that perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the example is a different problem.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the example is a different problem. The user says \"You will be given some example which I structured before.\" So the example is the user's own formatting. Therefore, in that example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless there was a misunderstanding.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the user wants to list all the assumptions from the problem, even if they're implicit. In the current problem about quadratic equations, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The equation is quadratic: x² + bx + c = 0.\n- The equation has real roots (since the methods are numerical approximations).\n- The iterative methods (continued fractions, nested radicals, nested squares) converge to a solution.\n\nBut the problem as stated in the original question doesn't explicitly mention these. However, the user's experiments show convergence, so maybe these are the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking about whether the methods always give the largest or smallest roots, the assumptions would be that the methods converge, and the problem is to determine which root they converge to.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions inherent in the problem setup. The problem statement is asking about the behavior of these methods in general. So the assumptions might be:\n\n- The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has two distinct real roots.\n- The method of continued fractions converges to a solution.\n- The method of nested radicals converges to a solution.\n- The method of nested squares converges to a solution.\n\nBut the user is asking to prove that the nested radical method gives the root with the greatest absolute value and the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest absolute value, assuming convergence. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has two real roots.\n- The iterative methods (nested radicals and nested squares) converge to a solution.\n\nThen the problem is to prove which root each method converges to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented without explicit assumptions, so the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: The quadratic equation is x² + bx + c = 0.\n\nProblem: Determine whether the method of nested radicals always gives the root with the greatest absolute value and the method of nested squares gives the root with the lowest absolute value, and investigate if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list each condition line by line. However, in the original problem, there are no explicit assumptions given beyond the quadratic equation. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that the equation is quadratic. But the example added an assumption not present in the original problem (divisible by 7), which may have been a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the user expects that even if the original problem doesn't state assumptions, we need to infer them from context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was incorrect, and the actual task is to extract explicit assumptions from the problem. The original problem here says \"A quadratic equation of the form x² + bx + c = 0 can be solved with the classical formula...\" So the assumption is that it's a quadratic equation. The problem is to analyze the three methods (continued fractions, nested radicals, nested squares) and determine which root they approximate, and if they can extend to higher degrees.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is quadratic: x² + bx + c = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the nested radical method gives the root with the greatest absolute value, the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest absolute value, and determine if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as asking if we can prove that this is always true and about general results, and extension. Therefore, the problem statement should reflect that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe quadratic equation is x² + bx + c = 0.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the nested radical method always gives the root with the greatest absolute value, the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest absolute value, and investigate if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nBut the example had multiple assumptions listed line by line. If there are more assumptions, like convergence, existence of real roots, etc., they should be listed. However, the original problem doesn't explicitly state these. Therefore, maybe the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nThe quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has real roots.\n\nAssumption:\nThe nested radical method converges to a solution.\n\nAssumption:\nThe nested squares method converges to a solution.\n\nProblem:\nProve that under these assumptions, the nested radical method gives the root with the greatest absolute value and the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest absolute value, and determine if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state these assumptions; the user is asking if these conclusions hold. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to establish these results under the necessary conditions, so the assumptions are part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only explicit assumption is that the equation is quadratic, and the problem is as posed.\n\nGiven the example provided by the user, where they added an assumption not present in the original problem (n divisible by 7), it seems that the user wants to extract any implicit assumptions from the problem statement. However, in this case, the quadratic equation problem doesn't have additional implicit assumptions beyond being quadratic. The existence of real roots might be necessary for the methods to work, but the original problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the confusion from the example, I think the safest way is to follow the structure as per the user's example, even if it might be incorrect. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. But perhaps the user intended to modify the problem. Therefore, perhaps the task is to structure the problem by extracting assumptions from the problem statement, even if they're not explicitly stated.\n\nIn the current problem, the user mentions that the methods cannot give all solutions but approximate one. They also mention convergence in experiments. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 has real roots.\n- The iterative methods (nested radicals, nested squares) converge.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't explicitly state these; the user is asking if the methods always give certain roots and if they can be extended. Therefore, the assumptions are part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only assumption is that the equation is quadratic, and the problem is to determine the properties of the methods.\n\nGiven the example, where the user added an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps they expect similar here. But without further clarification, it's challenging. However, to adhere to the example's structure, even if it's flawed, I will proceed.\n\nThe original problem is about quadratic equations and three methods to approximate a solution. The user's experiments suggest certain behaviors, and they ask if these are always true. The key assumptions here are that the equation is quadratic and that the methods converge. The problem is to prove the observed behaviors and explore extensions.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe equation is quadratic: x² + bx + c = 0.\nThe equation has two distinct real roots.\nThe nested radical method converges to a solution.\nThe nested squares method converges to a solution.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the nested radical method gives the root with the greatest absolute value, the nested squares method gives the root with the lowest absolute value, and determine if these methods can be extended to higher-degree equations.\n\nHowever, the original problem doesn't explicitly state that the equation has two distinct real roots, but since the user is talking about approximating roots, it's implied that roots exist. Therefore, these assumptions are reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering cases with repeated roots as well, but the problem is about two solutions. The original question mentions \"the two solutions\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list assumptions about the quadratic equation having real roots, the methods converging, and the problem being to prove the root selection and extension possibility.",
