    "Content": "I am trying to solve the following problem (found in Maddox's book \"Elements of Functional Analysis\", page 128): So we have the function $p:l_\\infty\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ given by $$\np(x) = \\inf\\left\\{\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\n$$ In which the infimum is taken over all finite sets of positive integers $\\{i_1,\\ldots,i_k\\}$. I already showed that: $p$ is well defined in $l_\\infty$ $p(\\alpha x)=\\alpha p(x)$, for all $x\\in l_\\infty$ and $\\alpha >0$ $p$ is subadditive, i.e $p(x+y)\\leq p(x)+p(y)$, for all $x,y\\in l_\\infty$ This part I'm not sure that it's the best way to do it: To obtain a functional as the problem states, I defined first another functional $g:c\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ ($c$={space of convergent sequences}), given by: $$\ng((x_n)_n) = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} x_n\n$$ It was not difficult to show that: $g$ is linear $g(x)\\leq p(x)$, for all $x\\in c$. (Actually we'll have $g(x)=p(x)$) $g((1,1,1,\\ldots))=1$ Now, the Hahn Banach Extension Theorem states that there is a functional $f:l_\\infty\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that: $f(x)=g(x)$, for all $x\\in c$ $f(x)\\leq p(x)$, for all $x\\in l_\\infty$ Now I just have to show that $f$ satisfies the conditions given by the problem, which are: $f(x)=1$ if $x_n= 1$ for all $n$ $f(x)\\geq 0$ if $x_n\\geq 0$ for all $n$ $f((x_2,x_3,\\ldots))=f((x_1,x_2,\\ldots))$ (1) is straightforward, since the condition is valid for $g$. My Difficulties: (2) I managed to demonstrate this one, but I'm not sure I'm correct, this is my solution: For every $x\\in l_\\infty$ we have $$\nf(x) \\leq p(x) = \\inf\\left\\{\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\n$$ So we have \\begin{align}\n-f(x) = f(-x) \\leq p(x) &= \\inf\\left\\{\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k (-x_{n+i_j})\\right) \\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\inf\\left\\{\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(-\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\inf\\left\\{-\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\\\\\n&= -\\sup\\left\\{\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\n\\end{align} From which we get $$\nf(x) \\geq \\sup\\left\\{\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\n$$ And clearly if $x_n\\geq 0$ for all $n$, then $$\nf(x) \\geq \\sup\\left\\{\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\} \\geq 0\n$$ Is this correct? (3) This is my biggest problem, I have little clue on how to show this, it is clear that in $c$ it is valid. I have the feeling that using the following inequality I can get somewhere: $$\n\\sup\\left\\{\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\} \\leq f(x) \\leq \\inf\\left\\{\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}\n$$ but I haven't been able to do much. If we define \n$$q(x)=\\sup\\left\\{\\liminf_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\\right) \\right\\}$$ I have no trouble in noticing that: \\begin{align}\np((x_2,x_3,\\ldots))=p((x_1,x_2,\\ldots))\\\\\nq((x_2,x_3,\\ldots))=q((x_1,x_2,\\ldots))\n\\end{align} If we had $p(x)=q(x)$ then it would be done, but I think this is not the case. Any suggestions?",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "This is only about the part 3, where you want to show that for $f(x)=f(Sx)$ where $S$ denotes the shift-operator, i.e.,\n\\begin{align*}\nx&=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_k,\\dots)\\\\\nSx&=(x_2,x_3,x_4,\\dots,x_{k+1},\\dots)\n\\end{align*} Since $f$ is linear, it clearly suffices to show $f(x-Sx)=0$. So you want to show that $f(y)=0$ for any $y$ obtained as\n$$y=(x_1-x_2,x_2-x_3,\\dots,x_k-x_{k+1},\\dots)$$\nfrom some bounded sequence $x\\in\\ell_\\infty$. Since $-p(-y)\\le f(y) \\le p(y)$, it suffices to show that $$p(y)=p(-y)=0$$ for every such $y$. For this purpose, let me try to rewrite $p$ in another way. For any finite set $F\\subseteq\\mathbb  N$ let us denote\n$$M_F(x)= \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j\\in F} x_{n+j}}{|F|}.$$\nIn this way we get that\n$$p(x)=\\inf\\{M_F(x); F\\subseteq\\mathbb N\\text{ is finite}\\}.$$ Let us also have a look at a different sublinear function\n$$r(x)=\\inf_{k\\in\\mathbb N}\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{x_{n+1}+\\dots+x_{n+k}}k.$$\nTo relate this in some way to $p(x)$ we may notice that this can be also written as\n$$r(x)=\\inf\\{M_F(x); F=\\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}\\text{ for some }k\\}.$$ After the rewriting, we can see immediately that $$p(x)\\le r(x).$$ It should not be very difficult to check that in fact we have\n$$-r(-x) \\le -p(-x) \\le p(x) \\le r(x).$$\n(Similarly as for $p$, change from $r(x)$ to $-r(-x)$ basically just involves interchanging infima and suprema. By the way, $-r(-x)$ is exactly what you denote as $q(x)$ in the current revision of your question.) So now it suffices to check that $r(y)=-r(-y)=0$ whenever $y=x-Sx$, which is almost immediate, since we get\n$$r(y) = \\inf_{k\\in\\mathbb N} \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{(x_{n+1}-x_{n+2})+\\dots+(x_{n+k}-x_{n+k+1})}k = \\inf_{k\\in\\mathbb N} \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{x_{n+1}-x_{n+k+1}}k = 0$$\nsimply by using the fact that $0\\le\\left|\\frac{x_{n+1}-x_{n+k+1}}k\\right| \\le \\frac{2\\|x\\|_\\infty}k$. So it seems that the above solves the part 3. But it still seems to me that this is kind of cheating or at least not what the author intended. The reason is that we could use Hahn-Banach Theorem directly with $r(x)$ to get Banach limit (as described in my answer to another question , or in this question which was shown in the sidebar among related questions). So it seems to me rather unlikely that the proof would use a more complicated function $p(x)$ when applying Hahn-Banach Theorem and then a simpler function $r(x)$ in the proof that the resulting functional has the desired property. But I still hope that this might be, in some way, useful to get closer to the solution which was intended by the author of the hint. Perhaps it is also interesting to mention that in a 1988 edition of the book the author chosen a different approach to prove existence of Banach limit from Hahn-Banach Theorem, see Exercise 5 on page 140 . The approach given there seems to be closer to the approach described at the end of this answer .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The user is working on a problem from Maddox's book about functional analysis, specifically involving the Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem. The goal is to construct a functional \\( f \\) on \\( l_\\infty \\) that satisfies three conditions: it equals 1 for the constant sequence 1, it's non-negative for non-negative sequences, and it's shift-invariant. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem and the user's progress so far. They defined a sublinear functional \\( p(x) \\) as the infimum of certain limsups of averages. They extended the limit functional \\( g \\) from the space of convergent sequences \\( c \\) to \\( l_\\infty \\) using Hahn-Banach, obtaining \\( f \\). They confirmed condition (1) easily because \\( g \\) already satisfies it. For condition (2), they derived that \\( f(x) \\geq 0 \\) when \\( x_n \\geq 0 \\) by relating \\( f(x) \\) to the sup of liminfs, which are non-negative. Now, the main issue is condition (3): showing shift invariance, i.e., \\( f((x_2, x_3, \\ldots)) = f((x_1, x_2, \\ldots)) \\).\n\nThe user's thoughts mention that \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) (the sup of liminfs) are shift-invariant. They wonder if \\( p = q \\), but suspect that's not the case. They need to find another approach.\n\nLet me recall that for shift-invariant functionals, a common technique is to use the properties of the sublinear functional \\( p \\) and how the extension \\( f \\) relates to it. Since \\( p \\) is shift-invariant (as the user noted), maybe we can show that both \\( f(Sx) \\leq f(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\leq f(Sx) \\), where \\( S \\) is the shift operator. Let's think: because \\( p(Sx) = p(x) \\), and \\( f \\) is dominated by \\( p \\), perhaps we can use the linearity of \\( f \\) and the invariance of \\( p \\) under shifts to get the equality.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about a generalized limit, perhaps similar to a Banach limit, which is known to be shift-invariant. The construction here seems similar to Banach limits. In standard proofs for Banach limits, shift invariance is shown by leveraging the properties of the sublinear function and the Hahn-Banach extension. Specifically, one might consider defining a new functional \\( f' \\) by \\( f'(x) = f(Sx) \\) and showing that \\( f' \\) also satisfies the conditions of the Hahn-Banach extension, hence \\( f' = f \\).\n\nLet me elaborate. Suppose we define \\( f'(x) = f(Sx) \\). Since \\( S \\) is a linear operator, \\( f' \\) is linear. We need to check if \\( f' \\leq p \\). For any \\( x \\in l_\\infty \\), \\( f'(x) = f(Sx) \\leq p(Sx) = p(x) \\), since \\( p \\) is shift-invariant. Therefore, \\( f' \\) is also a linear functional dominated by \\( p \\). But the original \\( f \\) was extended from \\( g \\) on \\( c \\), and since \\( f' \\) agrees with \\( f \\) on \\( c \\) (because for convergent sequences, shifting doesn't change the limit), by the uniqueness part of Hahn-Banach (if applicable), \\( f' = f \\). Therefore, \\( f(Sx) = f(x) \\), which is the required shift invariance.\n\nWait, but Hahn-Banach doesn't generally guarantee uniqueness. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. However, since both \\( f \\) and \\( f' \\) are extensions of \\( g \\) and are dominated by \\( p \\), perhaps we can use some property of \\( p \\) to show they must coincide. Alternatively, consider averaging \\( f \\) and \\( f' \\), but since they are linear, any convex combination would also be a linear functional dominated by \\( p \\). But without more constraints, uniqueness isn't assured.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might not require uniqueness, just existence, maybe the user can modify the extension process to enforce shift invariance. But the user already constructed \\( f \\) via Hahn-Banach. Perhaps another route is needed.\n\nLooking at the user's work, they have the inequality involving \\( q(x) \\leq f(x) \\leq p(x) \\), and both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are shift-invariant. If we can show that for the shifted sequence \\( Sx \\), the same inequality holds, maybe \\( f(Sx) \\) is squeezed between the same bounds as \\( f(x) \\), hence forcing equality.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any \\( x \\), \\( f(Sx) \\leq p(Sx) = p(x) \\). Similarly, \\( f(Sx) \\geq q(Sx) = q(x) \\). But \\( f(x) \\) is also between \\( q(x) \\) and \\( p(x) \\). However, this doesn't directly give \\( f(Sx) = f(x) \\).\n\nWait, maybe use linearity. Let's denote \\( Sx = (x_2, x_3, \\ldots) \\) and \\( Tx = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots) \\). The user needs to show \\( f(Sx) = f(Tx) \\). Wait, no, the problem states \\( f(Sx) = f(x) \\). Let me check: the problem says \"f((x2,x3,...))=f((x1,x2,...))\". So actually, shifting left and applying f gives the same value. Let me confirm: yes, the shift here is removing the first element and moving all others left by one. So Sx = (x2, x3, ...). The condition is f(Sx) = f(x).\n\nTo show f(Sx) = f(x), maybe consider f(Sx - x). If we can show that f(Sx - x) = 0, then f(Sx) = f(x). But Sx - x is the sequence (x2 - x1, x3 - x2, ...). Not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of applying the functional to Sx and x. Since f is linear, f(Sx) - f(x) = f(Sx - x). If we can show that this difference is zero, then we're done. To show that f(Sx - x) = 0 for all x, which would require that Sx - x is in the kernel of f. But how?\n\nAlternatively, use the property that for any x, the sequence x - Sx has the form (x1 - x2, x2 - x3, ...). If we can show that f(x - Sx) = 0, then f(x) = f(Sx). But how to show that.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the difference x - Sx might be a sequence whose liminf and limsup averages are zero, hence p(x - Sx) and q(x - Sx) are zero, which would force f(x - Sx) = 0. Let's test this idea.\n\nTake x - Sx = (x1 - x2, x2 - x3, ...). The averages over k terms would be (1/k)( (x1 - x2) + (x2 - x3) + ... + (xk - x_{k+1}) ) = (x1 - x_{k+1})/k. Since x is bounded, say ||x|| ≤ M, then |x1 - x_{k+1}| ≤ 2M, so the average is ≤ 2M/k. As k increases, this tends to zero. Therefore, the limsup of such averages as n increases would be zero. Similarly, the liminf would also be zero. Therefore, p(x - Sx) = 0. Since f(x - Sx) ≤ p(x - Sx) = 0, and similarly, f(Sx - x) ≤ p(Sx - x) = 0. But since f is linear, f(x - Sx) ≤ 0 and f(Sx - x) ≤ 0 implies f(x - Sx) = 0. Hence, f(x) = f(Sx).\n\nYes, this seems like a promising approach. Let's check this more carefully. For any x in l_infty, define y = x - Sx. Then y_n = x_n - x_{n+1}. For any finite set {i_1, ..., i_k}, consider the average (1/k) sum_{j=1}^k y_{n + i_j} = (1/k) sum_{j=1}^k (x_{n + i_j} - x_{n + i_j +1}). This telescopes to (1/k)(x_{n + i_1} - x_{n + i_k +1}). Since x is bounded by ||x||, the absolute value of this average is ≤ (2||x||)/k. As n tends to infinity, the positions n + i_j and n + i_k +1 are just shifted indices, but the bound remains the same. Therefore, limsup_{n→∞} of this average is ≤ (2||x||)/k. Taking the infimum over all k, which can be made arbitrarily large, hence p(y) = 0. Similarly, p(-y) = 0. Therefore, f(y) ≤ p(y) = 0 and f(-y) ≤ p(-y) = 0. But f(y) = -f(-y), so f(y) ≤ 0 and -f(y) ≤ 0, hence f(y) = 0. Therefore, f(x - Sx) = 0, so f(x) = f(Sx).\n\nThis seems correct. Therefore, condition (3) follows by showing that the difference x - Sx is annihilated by f, hence f is shift-invariant.",
