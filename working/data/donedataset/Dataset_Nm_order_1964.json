I also found for $p=9p'$ where $p'$ is $1$ or a prime, and $p'\\equiv 1 \\mod 6$ , the Euler's totient function of $p$ is \\begin{align}\n&\\varphi(p)=\\varphi(9)=6 \\;\\;\\;\\text{when }p'=1\\\\\n&\\varphi(p)=6(p'-1) \\;\\;\\;\\text{when }p'\\text{ is a prime}\n\\end{align} The integers up to $p$ that are relatively prime to $p$ can also be divided into $3$ subgroups $H_1, H_2, H_3$ . When $p'$ is a prime, the count of integers in each subgroup is $2(p'-1)$ . Generating the subgroups is not as simple as that for a prime.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. The main question seems to be about proving that certain Gauss sums related to cubic characters are roots of a specific polynomial. The problem is split into two parts: one when p is a prime congruent to 1 mod 6, and another when p is 9 times a prime or 1, also with certain congruence conditions.\n\nStarting with the first part where p is a prime, p ≡ 1 mod 6. The user mentions that the sums t1, t2, t3 (defined as sums over cosets of the subgroup H generated by g³ in the multiplicative group F_p^×) are roots of a cubic polynomial. The polynomial is given as t³ + t² - (p-1)/3 t - (ap + 3p -1)/27, where a is determined by 4p = a² + 27b² with a ≡ 1 mod 3. The user is asking for a proof or reference in English since the original source is in German.\n\nThen there's a second scenario where p = 9p', with p' either 1 or a prime congruent to 1 mod 6. Here, the totient function is different, and the sums over subgroups H1, H2, H3 (each of size 2(p' -1) when p' is prime) are roots of another polynomial: t³ - (p/3)t - (ap)/27, where now a ≡ 0 mod 3 in the equation 4p = a² + 27b².\n\nThe user has verified this with examples and wants a proof. Let's try to parse the assumptions and structure the problem properly.\n\nFirst, for the prime case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. p is a prime number.\n2. p ≡ 1 mod 6.\n3. g is a primitive root modulo p, generating F_p^× ≅ C_{p-1}.\n4. H is the subgroup generated by g³, so H has elements {1, g³, g⁶, ..., g^{p-4}}.\n5. The cosets are gH and g²H.\n6. The sums t1, t2, t3 are defined as sums of ζ^x where ζ = e^(2πi/p) and x is in H, gH, g²H respectively.\n7. By Gauss's theorem, there exist integers a and b such that 4p = a² + 27b².\n8. a ≡ 1 mod 3 and b > 0, making a and b unique.\n9. The polynomial whose roots are t1, t2, t3 is t³ + t² - (p-1)/3 t - (ap + 3p -1)/27.\n\nThen the problem is to prove this polynomial equation given these assumptions.\n\nFor the composite case where p = 9p':\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. p = 9p', where p' is 1 or a prime.\n2. If p' is a prime, then p' ≡ 1 mod 6.\n3. The Euler totient function φ(p) is 6 when p' =1 and 6(p' -1) when p' is prime.\n4. The multiplicative group (Z/pZ)^× is isomorphic to C_{p'-1} × C_6 when p' is prime.\n5. The integers coprime to p are divided into three subgroups H1, H2, H3, each of size 2(p' -1) when p' is prime.\n6. The sums t1, t2, t3 are sums over these subgroups with ζ = e^(2πi/p).\n7. There exist integers a and b such that 4p = a² + 27b² with a ≡ 0 mod 3.\n8. The polynomial here is t³ - (p/3)t - (ap)/27.\n\nThe problem here is to prove this polynomial relation.\n\nThe user wants both cases addressed, but the original problem mentions two separate scenarios. However, when structuring the problem, maybe we need to split them into two separate problems? But according to the example, the user combined all the assumptions into one. But in the original problem here, the user has two cases: prime p ≡1 mod6 and composite p=9p'. The way the example was structured combined the assumptions line by line. However, since these are two separate cases with different conditions, perhaps they should be structured as two separate problems. But the user might have intended them as one problem with two parts. But the example given by the user (the divisibility by 91) was a single problem. So perhaps here, the user has two distinct problems but presented in one question. However, the initial instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" per each problem. So maybe each case is a separate problem.\n\nBut looking back at the user's original problem, they wrote it as a single question on Math Stack Exchange, asking about both cases. So perhaps we need to structure both as one problem with multiple assumptions, but that might be conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to structure each case separately. However, the example given by the user only had one problem. Let's check the original example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user formatted it with two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, but the original problem didn't have that. Wait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would include all integers, not just those divisible by 7. But in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which wasn't in the original. That suggests maybe the example had a mistake. Wait, this is confusing. Because if the original problem is for every integer n, then the assumption shouldn't restrict n to be divisible by 7. But the formatted problem in the example includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the example provided by the user is incorrect, but the instruction is to follow that format. So maybe the user made a mistake in their example. For the problem they presented, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7, which is not present in the original. That seems like an error. But regardless, the task is to follow the format given, so even if the example has a mistake, we need to proceed as per instructions.\n\nIn the current problem, the user has two different scenarios: when p is prime and when p is composite (9p'). The original question on Math Stack Exchange includes both, so perhaps we need to structure both as one problem with multiple assumptions. However, the assumptions for each case are different, so perhaps the user wants two separate formatted problems. But the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\" for each problem. Since the original question includes both cases, maybe we should structure each case separately.\n\nBut since the user provided one example, perhaps they want us to combine all the relevant assumptions into one problem. Alternatively, given that the original question discusses two different cases (prime and composite p), perhaps they should be split into two problems. However, the user hasn't specified that. Let me check the exact original problem again.\n\nLooking back, the user's original question starts with the prime case, then discusses the composite case. The title is \"Gauss Sums of Cubic Characters\", so it's about cubic characters in finite fields. The first part is when p is a prime ≡1 mod6, and the second part is when p=9p' where p' is 1 or a prime ≡1 mod6.\n\nIn the problem statement, the user is asking for proofs of both cases. So perhaps the two cases are part of the same problem but under different assumptions. Therefore, when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions for each case separately but within the same problem. However, the example given had a single problem with assumptions listed line by line. But here, the two cases have different assumptions, so it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each case as a separate problem. However, since the user mentioned both in the same question, perhaps it's better to treat them as two separate problems. But the example combined different conditions into one problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps we should structure each case as a separate problem.\n\nFirst problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- p is a prime number.\n- p ≡ 1 mod 6.\n- g is a primitive root modulo p.\n- H is the subgroup generated by g³.\n- The sums t1, t2, t3 are defined over the cosets H, gH, g²H with ζ = e^(2πi/p).\n- 4p = a² + 27b² with a ≡1 mod3 and b>0.\n- The polynomial is t³ + t² - (p-1)/3 t - (ap +3p -1)/27.\n\nProblem: Prove that t1, t2, t3 are roots of the given polynomial.\n\nSecond problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- p =9p' where p' is 1 or a prime.\n- If p' is a prime, then p' ≡1 mod6.\n- φ(p) is 6 when p'=1, else 6(p' -1).\n- The multiplicative group is isomorphic to C_{p'-1} × C_6 when p' is prime.\n- The integers coprime to p are divided into three subgroups H1, H2, H3 each of size 2(p' -1) when p' is prime.\n- The sums t1, t2, t3 are over these subgroups.\n- 4p =a² +27b² with a ≡0 mod3.\n- The polynomial is t³ - (p/3)t - (ap)/27.\n\nProblem: Prove that t1, t2, t3 are roots of the given polynomial.\n\nBut the user's original question seems to present these as two related cases under the same problem. However, given the formatting example, which combines all assumptions into one list, perhaps we need to structure each case as a separate problem. However, since the user might have intended both cases as part of the same problem, but with different assumptions, perhaps the correct approach is to present them as two separate problems. But since the original question is a single post, maybe we need to include both under the same problem with two sets of assumptions. But the example didn't do that. The example had one problem with a list of assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants each case to be treated as a separate problem. However, since the user hasn't specified, and the example only structures a single problem, perhaps we should structure each case separately. But the user's instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". Since the original question is a single post discussing both cases, perhaps we need to combine all relevant assumptions into one problem. However, the two cases have different conditions. Alternatively, the user might have intended each case as a separate problem, so maybe we should structure them as two separate problems. But given the example provided, which structures one problem, perhaps the user expects a single problem. However, in the original question, the user is asking about two different scenarios, so maybe they should be structured as two separate problems. But the user hasn't specified whether to split them or not.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest way is to structure each case as a separate problem. But since the user provided an example with a single problem, maybe we should try to combine them. However, that would complicate the assumptions. Let me attempt to do so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the composite case is an extension or a different problem, and the user is asking for both. Given that, perhaps the answer should present two separate formatted problems. However, since the user's instruction is to format the given problem (singular) into the specified structure, perhaps the entire question is considered one problem with two parts. But the example didn't do that; it only formatted a single problem. Therefore, maybe the user wants both cases to be formatted into two separate problems. However, the initial instruction says \"read the mathematics question on Math Stack Exchange, filtered the unrelated informations, and structure that problem as the following format\". The user's original question is one post, so perhaps it's intended to be one problem with multiple parts. However, the example was a single problem. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to structure each case as a separate problem, but the user's example didn't do that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example by adding an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. In the original problem, they wanted to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added n divisible by 7. That seems like an error. But regardless, following the instructions, we should follow the format given in the example, even if the example is flawed. \n\nTherefore, for the current problem, we need to list all the assumptions line by line for each problem. Given that the original question has two distinct cases, perhaps the answer should present two separate formatted problems. But since the user hasn't explicitly instructed that, maybe we need to combine them. However, combining them would mix different assumptions. Therefore, I think the answer should present two separate formatted problems, each corresponding to one case (prime p and composite p=9p'). \n\nBut the user's example only had one problem. Maybe the user expects both cases to be in one problem. Alternatively, the reference to composite p=9p' might be part of extending the original problem, but perhaps the main problem is the prime case, and the composite case is an additional inquiry. But the user is asking for both. \n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps structuring two separate problems is better, but within the same answer. However, the original example structures one problem. Given the user's instructions, perhaps they expect each case to be a separate problem. But since the user hasn't specified, but the example is single, maybe we should structure the main problem (prime case) and then the composite case as another problem. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended the composite case as part of the same problem but under different assumptions. For example, when p is a prime ≡1 mod6, and when p is composite 9p'. However, since these are different structures, it's challenging to combine them. \n\nGiven that the user includes both cases in their question and asks for proofs of both, perhaps the formatted problem should include both. However, the example given in the instruction had a single problem with multiple assumptions. Therefore, perhaps we can structure the problem as two separate problems, each with their own assumptions and problem statements. \n\nBut how to present that? The user's example only had one problem. Since the user's original question includes two different scenarios, I think the correct approach is to format each as a separate problem. However, the user's instruction might expect a single formatted problem. Alternatively, maybe the composite case is part of the same problem but under different assumptions. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the best approach is to format each case separately. Therefore, the first formatted problem is for prime p ≡1 mod6, and the second is for composite p=9p' with the given conditions. Each will have their own assumptions and problem statements. However, since the user's example combined all assumptions into one list, perhaps we need to do the same here. But given the two different cases, it's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's main problem is the prime case, and the composite case is additional context but not part of the main problem to be formatted. The user starts with the prime case, discusses the reference, then moves to the composite case. So perhaps the formatted problem should focus on the prime case, and the composite case is a follow-up question. However, the user explicitly asks about both. \n\nThis is quite confusing. Given the instructions and the example, perhaps we should format each case as a separate problem. Therefore, two formatted problems. But the user's example only shows one. However, the user's instruction says \"structure that problem as the following format\", implying each problem should be formatted individually. Since the original question has two distinct problems, we should structure each accordingly.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified whether to split them. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed by structuring each case as a separate problem.",
