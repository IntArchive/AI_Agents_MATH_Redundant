    "Content": "I'm beginner with proofs and I got the follow exercise: Prove the inequality $$(a + b)\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{4}{b}\\Bigr) \\ge 9$$ when $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. Determine when the equality occurs. I'm lost, could you guys give me a tip from where to start, or maybe show a good resource for beginners in proofs ? Thanks in advance.",
    "AcceptedAnswer": "The first thing to do is simplify the expression on the lefthand side of the inequality. $$(a + b)\\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{4}{b}\\right)=\\frac{(a+b)(4a+b)}{ab}=\\frac{4a^2+5ab+b^2}{ab}=\\frac{4a}b+5+\\frac{b}a\\;.$$ Now notice that the resulting expression contains both $\\frac{a}b$ and $\\frac{b}a$ ; this is an indication that it might simplify matters to introduce a new quantity, $x=\\frac{a}b$ , and rewrite the inequality as $$4x+5+\\frac1x\\ge 9\\;,$$ or $$4x+\\frac1x\\ge 4\\;.\\tag{0}$$ The natural thing to do now is to multiply through by $x$ to get rid of the fraction, but be careful: since this is an inequality, the sign of $x$ matters. If $x\\ge 0$ we get $4x^2+1\\ge 4x$ , or $4x^2-4x+1\\ge 0$ , but if $x<0$ we get $4x^2+1\\le 4x$ , or $4x^2-4x+1\\le 0$ . In either case, though, we recognize that $4x^2-4x+1=(2x-1)^2$ , so either $$x\\ge 0\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(2x-1)^2\\ge 0\\tag{1}$$ or $$x<0\\quad\\text{and}\\quad(2x-1)^2\\le 0\\;.\\tag{2}$$ Now $(2)$ is impossible: $(2x-1)^2\\le 0$ if and only if $(2x-1)^2=0$ , in which case $2x=1$ , $x=\\frac12$ , and $x\\not<0$ . Thus, any solution must come from $(1)$ : $x>0$ , and $(2x-1)^2\\ge 0$ . If $2x\\ne 1$ , then $2x-1\\ne0$ , so $(2x-1)^2>0$ , and we have a solution. If $2x=1$ , then $x=\\frac12>0$ and $(2x-1)^2=0\\ge0$ , and again we have a solution. In short, every positive $x$ is a solution, no negative $x$ is a solution, and $x$ can’t be $0$ . (Why not?) We could actually have discovered this just by looking more closely at $(0)$ , but one won’t always have so nice an inequality as that. What does this mean in terms of $a$ and $b$ ? Recall that $x=\\dfrac{a}b$ ; thus, $x>0$ if and only if $\\dfrac{a}b>0$ , which is true if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same algebraic sign: both are positive, or both are negative. Since we were told that both are positive, we know that the inequality holds for all $a$ and $b$ in the given domain. Finally, we have equality in $(0)$ if and only if $4x^2-4x+1=0$ , or $(2x-1)^2=0$ , i.e., if and only if $x=\\frac12$ . Since $x=\\frac{a}b$ , that’s equivalent to $\\frac{a}b=\\frac12$ , or $b=2a$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem": "Okay, so I need to help structure this problem according to the given format. Let's start by looking at the original question from Math Stack Exchange. The user is asking how to prove the inequality (a + b)(1/a + 4/b) ≥ 9 when a and b are positive, and also determine when equality holds.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The problem states that a > 0 and b > 0. Each assumption should be on a separate line and apply to one object. So, \"a is greater than 0\" and \"b is greater than 0\". There's no mention of any other conditions or properties here. The user is a beginner, so maybe they haven't considered techniques like AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz, which are common in such proofs. But the task is just to structure the problem, not solve it.\n\nWait, the example given had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem only said \"for every integer n\". Oh, maybe the example was wrong? Wait, no. Let me check the example again. The original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. The original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That's a mistake. Wait, but looking back, maybe the user made a mistake in their example? Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\", which contradicts. That must be an error. So maybe the example is flawed. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instructions to structure the current problem correctly.\n\nIn the current problem, the user states the inequality holds when a > 0 and b > 0. So the assumptions are simply that a and b are positive. No other hidden conditions. The problem is to prove the inequality and find when equality occurs. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions should list that a and b are each greater than 0, each on their own line. The problem statement is to prove the given inequality and determine the equality condition.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't miss any assumptions. The original problem doesn't mention any other constraints. So the assumptions are just a > 0 and b > 0. The problem is to prove the inequality and find when equality holds. That should be straightforward. I think that's all. No other conditions or objects involved here.",
