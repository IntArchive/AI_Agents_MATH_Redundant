Equivalently, the subspace topology on A is the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map i: A → X, i(a) = a, is continuous.\n\n4. **G as a subset of ℝ²**: By construction, G ⊆ ℝ². Specifically, G consists of all points of the form (x, sin(1/x)) for x ∈ (0,1) together with the point (0,0).\n\n5. **Inheritance of subspace topology**: Since G is a subset of the topological space ℝ² (with Euclidean topology), by the definition of how subsets inherit topology from their containing space, G automatically comes equipped with the subspace topology. Formally:\n   - The topological space (G, τ_G) where τ_G = {U ⊆ G : ∃ V open in ℝ² such that U = V ∩ G}\n   - This τ_G is precisely the subspace topology on G inherited from ℝ².\n\n6. **Verification**: To verify this is indeed the correct topology on G, note that:\n   a) The inclusion map i: G → ℝ², i((x,y(x))) = (x,y(x)), is continuous with respect to τ_G.\n   b) τ_G is the smallest topology on G making the inclusion map continuous.\n   c) For any open set V ⊆ ℝ², its intersection with G, V ∩ G, is open in G by definition of τ_G.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the graph G of the function y is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ². This follows directly from the definition of subspace topology and the fact that G is defined as a subset of ℝ². The specific form of the function y (y(x) = sin(1/x) for x > 0 and y(0) = 0) does not affect this topological inheritance property; it only determines the particular shape of the subset G.\n\nRemark: This result is essentially tautological in topology - when we speak of 'the graph of a function' as a geometric object in ℝ², the natural topology to consider is precisely the subspace topology inherited from ℝ². Any other topology would require explicit specification and justification.",
