    "AcceptedAnswer":"From some of the comments above you seem a little confused. Since you said you are not familiar with proofs I will try to write this out in a way that you can understand. You are trying to prove the equivalence of the following statements: $P:$ A commutative ring $R$ with $1$ is a field. $Q:$ The only ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and $(1)$. Let us look at statement $Q$ closely. Well it is saying that the only ideals of $R$ are the zero ideal (which has only one element, zero) and $(1)$. What is $(1)$? Well by definition of an ideal if you multiply anything in the ideal $(1)$ by anything in $R$, you should get something back in $(1)$ again. But then $1$ is the multiplicative identity of $R$ so multiplying everything in $R$ by $1$ just gives everything in $R$ back again. This means that $(1)$ must be the whole ring $R$. Now suppose we want to prove $P \\implies Q$. Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. Here \"ring\" means \"commutative ring with a unit\". Now here are some things you should know: (1) $I$ is non-empty (2) $I$ must at least contain the element $0$ (Why?) (3) If $I$ has more than one element this means that at least one non-zero element $a$ of the ring must be in $I$. (Why?) Therefore if $I$ contains only $0$, $I = (0)$. If $I$ does not only contain zero, then by (3) above it contains at least one non-zero element $a$ of $R$. Now recall that we are trying to prove $P \\implies Q$. We already know $P$. Therefore this means by definition of a field that $a^{-1}$ exists in $R$. But then by definition of an ideal $I$, $a^{-1} a = 1$ must be in $I$. Therefore $1 \\in I$ so that $I$ must be the whole ring $R$. Hence $I = (1)$. This establishes $P \\implies Q$. Now for the converse: To show $Q \\implies P$ it suffices to show that non-zero every element $a \\in R$ contains a multiplicative inverse. So let $a$ be a non-zero element of $R$. The trick now is to consider the principal ideal generated by $a$ (which we denote by $(a)$ ). Now by assumption of $Q$, since the only ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and $(1)$, this means that $(a)$ being an ideal of $R$ must be either $(0)$ or $(1)$. Now $(a)$ cannot be $(0)$ for $a \\neq 0$. So $(a) = (1)$. But then this means that $1$ is a multiple of $a$, viz. there exists a non-zero $c$ such that $$ac = 1.$$ However this is precisely saying that $a$ has a multiplicative inverse. Since $a$ was an arbitrary non-zero element of $R$, we are done. Q.E.D. Does this help you? I can discuss more if you need help.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem are separated. The original question is about proving that a commutative ring R is a field if and only if the only ideals are (0) and (1). \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that R is a commutative ring with identity. That's one assumption. Then, the other part is about the ideals: the only ideals are R itself and the zero ideal. But since the problem is an \"if and only if,\" I need to consider both directions. However, in the example given, the assumptions are split into individual lines, each addressing one property applied to one object. \n\nLooking at the original problem: \"Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Show that R is a field iff the only ideals are (0) and (1).\" So the assumptions here are that R is a commutative ring with identity. The problem is the biconditional statement. The user example didn't split the biconditional into separate assumptions, but rather kept the problem as the biconditional. So perhaps the assumptions are just the properties of R being commutative and having an identity, and the problem is the equivalence between being a field and having only those two ideals.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem statement here, the assumptions are inherent to the ring: commutative and with identity. So those should be the assumptions. The problem is to show the equivalence. \n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nAssumption 1: R is a commutative ring.\n\nAssumption 2: R has an identity element.\n\nProblem: Show that R is a field if and only if the only ideals of R are (0) and (1).\n\nWait, but in the example, the user split the assumptions even if they were part of the original problem's setup. So here, \"Let R be a commutative ring with identity\" translates to two assumptions: commutative and with identity. But in the example, \"for every integer n\" was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem changed the assumption to n being integer and divisible by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Because 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the original problem had a typo, but the user's formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. Hmm, maybe the user made an error in their example. But regardless, I need to follow their format.\n\nBut according to the problem given here, the original problem is correct: \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted version, they added the assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which actually changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example was a bad one. But I have to proceed with the current problem.\n\nSo the current problem is: Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Show R is a field iff the only ideals are (0) and (1). So the assumptions here are that R is commutative and has identity. The problem is the biconditional. So following the example's structure, even if the example may have had an error, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be:\n\nAssumption: R is a commutative ring.\n\nAssumption: R has an identity element.\n\nProblem: Show that R is a field if and only if the only ideals of R are (0) and (1).\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem was rephrased with the assumptions listed. So maybe the problem statement here doesn't need to repeat the assumptions, but just the actual problem. Let me check the example again.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nSo in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they split it into assumptions that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But that's modifying the original problem's conditions. That seems like a mistake. But perhaps the example was incorrect, but the user wants the current problem to follow that format regardless.\n\nTherefore, in the current problem, the original assumptions are that R is commutative with identity, which should be split into two separate assumptions. Then the problem is the biconditional statement.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nAssumption: R is a commutative ring.\n\nAssumption: R has an identity element.\n\nProblem: Show that R is a field if and only if the only ideals of R are (0) and (1).\n\nBut wait, the original problem says \"the only ideals are R itself and the zero ideal (0)\". So (1) is R itself since 1 generates the entire ring. So maybe the problem statement in the formatted version should use (0) and (1), but in the original question, the user wrote (0) and (1). So the problem as stated in the original question is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem is as above. The key is to split the properties given in the original problem into separate assumptions. Since the original problem starts with \"Let R be a commutative ring with identity\", those are two separate properties: commutativity and existence of identity. So each gets its own line in assumptions.",

Then we don't have new_problem\nWe prove the following theorem: For any positive integer n, n is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by 3.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nLet n be a positive integer. Write n in its decimal expansion:\n\nn = a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0\n\nwhere each a_i is an integer digit with 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 9, and a_k ≠ 0 (since n is positive).\n\nLet S = a_k + a_{k-1} + ... + a_1 + a_0 be the sum of the digits of n.\n\n**Step 1: Show that 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)**\nSince 10 = 9 + 1, and 9 is divisible by 3, we have 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\n**Step 2: Show that 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3) for all nonnegative integers m**\nWe prove this by induction or by using properties of modular arithmetic:\n- Base case: For m = 0, 10^0 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n- For m = 1, we already have 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3) from Step 1.\n- Inductive step: Assume 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3). Then 10^{m+1} = 10 × 10^m ≡ 1 × 1 = 1 (mod 3) by the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we have 10^m ≡ 1^m = 1 (mod 3) for all m ≥ 0.\n\n**Step 3: Compute n modulo 3**\nUsing the decimal expansion and the result from Step 2:\n\nn = a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0\n\nTaking this modulo 3:\n\nn ≡ a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0 (mod 3)\n  ≡ a_k × 1 + a_{k-1} × 1 + ... + a_1 × 1 + a_0 (mod 3)  (since 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3))\n  ≡ a_k + a_{k-1} + ... + a_1 + a_0 (mod 3)\n  ≡ S (mod 3)\n\nThus, n ≡ S (mod 3).\n\n**Step 4: Prove the forward implication (if 3 divides n, then 3 divides S)**\nIf 3 divides n, then n ≡ 0 (mod 3). From Step 3, we have n ≡ S (mod 3), so S ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, 3 divides S.\n\n**Step 5: Prove the reverse implication (if 3 divides S, then 3 divides n)**\nIf 3 divides S, then S ≡ 0 (mod 3). From Step 3, we have n ≡ S (mod 3), so n ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, 3 divides n.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that n ≡ S (mod 3), which means n and S leave the same remainder when divided by 3. In particular, n is divisible by 3 if and only if S is divisible by 3. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The same proof technique works for divisibility by 9, since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9) as well. For divisibility by other numbers, different approaches are needed.",
