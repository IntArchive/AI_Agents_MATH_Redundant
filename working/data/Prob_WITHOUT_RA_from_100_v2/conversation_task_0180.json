Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We have $f(\\\\alpha) = (\\\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$. Therefore, $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Prove $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\\nWe apply Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p = 2$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are: $a_3 = 1$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_1 = 0$, $a_0 = -2$. We check:\\n1. $p = 2$ divides all non-leading coefficients: $2 \\\\mid 0$, $2 \\\\mid 0$, $2 \\\\mid (-2)$\\n2. $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term: $4 \\\\nmid (-2)$\\n3. The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2\\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied, $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Step 3: $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\\nSince $f(x)$ is monic, irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and has $\\alpha$ as a root, it must be the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of smallest degree with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$ having $\\alpha$ as a root.\\n\\n**Step 4: Construct the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$**\\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ consists of all polynomial expressions in $\\alpha = \\\\sqrt[3]{2}$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\alpha^3 = 2$, any power $\\alpha^n$ with $n \\\\geq 3$ can be reduced using the relation $\\alpha^3 = 2$. Therefore, every element of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ can be written uniquely in the form:\\n$$a + b\\\\alpha + c\\\\alpha^2$$\\nwhere $a, b, c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\alpha^2 = (\\\\sqrt[3]{2})^2 = \\\\sqrt[3]{4}$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Show $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}] \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ as fields**\\nConsider the evaluation homomorphism:\\n$$\\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{Q}[x] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$$\\ndefined by $\\\\phi(g(x)) = g(\\\\alpha)$. This is a ring homomorphism. The kernel of $\\phi$ is precisely the set of polynomials that vanish at $\\alpha$, which is the ideal generated by the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$. Therefore, $\\\\ker(\\\\phi) = (x^3 - 2)$.\\n\\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings:\\n$$\\\\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\\\ker(\\\\phi) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{im}(\\\\phi)$$\\nSince $\\phi$ is surjective (every element $a + b\\\\alpha + c\\\\alpha^2$ is the image of $a + bx + cx^2$), we have:\\n$$\\\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2) \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$$\\n\\nMoreover, since $f(x)$ is irreducible, the ideal $(x^3 - 2)$ is maximal in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, making $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ a field. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is also a field.\\n\\n**Step 6: Determine the extension degree $[\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\\\mathbb{Q}]$**\\nThe degree of the field extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial of the primitive element $\\alpha$. Since the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ has degree 3, we have:\\n$$[\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\\\mathbb{Q}] = \\\\deg(f(x)) = 3$$\\n\\nAlternatively, we can see that $\\\\{1, \\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2\\\\}$ forms a basis for $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. This basis has 3 elements, confirming the dimension is 3.\\n\\n**Step 7: Conclude $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3**\\nA number field is defined as a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. We have shown:\\n1. $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a field extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$\\n2. The extension is finite with degree $[\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\\n\\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Additional verification**: To confirm $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is indeed a field (not just a ring), we note that for any nonzero element $a + b\\\\alpha + c\\\\alpha^2$, its inverse exists in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ because:\\n1. The minimal polynomial $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible, so $\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ is a field\\n2. The isomorphism $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}] \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ preserves the field structure\\n\\nThus, we have rigorously proven that $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\"\n}",
