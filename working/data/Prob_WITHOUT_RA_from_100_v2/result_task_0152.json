    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem states that if an entire function f(z) satisfies |f(z)| ≤ k|z|^n for sufficiently large |z|, where n is a positive integer and k is a positive constant, then f must be a polynomial of degree at most n. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an entire function is. An entire function is a function that's holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane. Examples include polynomials, exponential functions, sine, cosine, etc. Now, the key thing here is that the function is bounded by a polynomial of degree n for large |z|. The question is to show that under this condition, the entire function must itself be a polynomial of degree at most n.\n\nI remember that there's a theorem related to entire functions bounded by polynomials. Isn't it Liouville's theorem? Wait, Liouville's theorem states that if an entire function is bounded (i.e., |f(z)| ≤ M for some constant M for all z), then f must be constant. But this is a more general case where the bound is a polynomial instead of a constant. So maybe there's a generalization of Liouville's theorem here.\n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is the Taylor series expansion of entire functions. Since f is entire, it can be expressed as a power series expansion around 0 (or any point, but let's take 0 for simplicity) that converges everywhere in the complex plane. So, f(z) = Σ_{k=0}^∞ a_k z^k. The coefficients a_k can be given by Cauchy's integral formula: a_k = f^{(k)}(0)\/k! = (1\/(2πi)) ∫_{C_R} f(z)\/z^{k+1} dz, where C_R is a circle of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nNow, if we can show that all coefficients a_k for k > n are zero, then f would be a polynomial of degree at most n. That seems like a plan. So, how can we use the given inequality |f(z)| ≤ k|z|^n for |z| sufficiently large to show that a_k = 0 when k > n?\n\nUsing the Cauchy estimate for the coefficients. The Cauchy estimate says that |a_k| ≤ (1\/(2π)) * max_{|z|=R} |f(z)| \/ R^{k} * 2πR. Simplifying, this becomes |a_k| ≤ max_{|z|=R} |f(z)| \/ R^k. \n\nGiven the condition, for sufficiently large R, |f(z)| ≤ k R^n when |z| = R (since |z| = R, so |z|^n = R^n). Therefore, substituting into the Cauchy estimate, we get |a_k| ≤ (k R^n) \/ R^k = k \/ R^{k - n}.\n\nNow, if k > n, then k - n is a positive integer. Therefore, as R approaches infinity, R^{k - n} becomes very large, so the right-hand side k \/ R^{k - n} approaches zero. But the left-hand side |a_k| is a constant that doesn't depend on R. The only way this inequality can hold for all sufficiently large R is if |a_k| = 0. Hence, a_k = 0 for all k > n.\n\nTherefore, all coefficients beyond degree n are zero, which implies that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most n. That seems to be the solution. Let me check if I missed anything. The key steps are: entire function has power series expansion, apply Cauchy estimates using the given bound, take the limit as R approaches infinity to force the coefficients to be zero beyond degree n. Yep, that should do it.",

For any $R > 0$ and any non-negative integer $m$, Cauchy's integral formula for derivatives gives:\n$$f^{(m)}(0) = \\frac{m!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{m+1}} \\, dz.$$\nThis holds for any circle centered at 0 with radius $R > 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the growth condition**\nLet $R_0 > 0$ be such that $|f(z)| \\leq k|z|^n$ for all $|z| > R_0$. For any $R > \\max(R_0, 0)$, we can apply this estimate on the circle $|z| = R$.\n\n**Step 3: Estimating the derivatives**\nFor $m > n$, we estimate $|f^{(m)}(0)|$ using the integral representation:\n\\begin{align*}\n|f^{(m)}(0)| &= \\left|\\frac{m!}{2\\pi i} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{f(z)}{z^{m+1}} \\, dz\\right| \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{m!}{2\\pi} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{|f(z)|}{|z|^{m+1}} \\, |dz| \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{m!}{2\\pi} \\oint_{|z|=R} \\frac{k|z|^n}{|z|^{m+1}} \\, |dz| \\quad \\text{(using the growth condition)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{m!}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{kR^n}{R^{m+1}} \\cdot \\oint_{|z|=R} |dz| \\\\\n&= \\frac{m!}{2\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{kR^n}{R^{m+1}} \\cdot 2\\pi R \\\\\n&= m! \\, k \\, R^{n-m}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 4: Taking the limit as $R \\to \\infty$**\nFor $m > n$, we have $n - m < 0$, so $R^{n-m} \\to 0$ as $R \\to \\infty$. Therefore, taking the limit as $R \\to \\infty$ in the inequality:\n$$|f^{(m)}(0)| \\leq \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} m! \\, k \\, R^{n-m} = 0.$$\nThus $|f^{(m)}(0)| = 0$, which implies $f^{(m)}(0) = 0$ for all $m > n$.\n\n**Step 5: Taylor series expansion**\nSince $f$ is entire, it has a Taylor series expansion about $z = 0$ that converges for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$:\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(m)}(0)}{m!} z^m.$$\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nFrom Step 4, we have $f^{(m)}(0) = 0$ for all $m > n$. Therefore, the Taylor series reduces to:\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{m=0}^{n} \\frac{f^{(m)}(0)}{m!} z^m,$$\nwhich is a polynomial of degree at most $n$. (The degree is exactly $n$ if $f^{(n)}(0) \\neq 0$, and less than $n$ if $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$.)\n\nThus we have proved that $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$.\n\n**Remark:** This result is a generalization of Liouville's theorem, which corresponds to the case $n = 0$ (bounded entire functions are constant).",
