            "text": "Now I need to output the answer in the required JSON format. According to the guidelines, if there's no redundant assumption, I should output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"no\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"Assumption 1: $G$ is a non-abelian group\", \"Assumption 2: $G$ is a simple group\", \"Assumption 3: The order of $G$ is less than 100\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": null,\n  \"redundant_assumption_number\": null,\n  \"new_problem\": null,\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": null\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, let me re-read the guidelines. Guideline_2 says: \"If there is not a redundant assumption, output JSON with 'answer_to_21', 'assumptions', 'redundant_assumption: no', 'redundant_assumption_number: no', 'new_problem: no' and 'solution_for_new_problem: no'.\"\n\nActually, it says \"answer_to_21\" but I think that's a typo and should be \"answer_to_Q1\". Also, it says to use \"no\" for string fields, but the schema shows type can be string or null. Looking at the schema:\n- \"redundant_assumption\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}]\n- \"new_problem\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}]\n- \"solution_for_new_problem\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"string\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}]\n\nSo I can use null for these. For \"redundant_assumption_number\", the schema shows {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}]}, so I can use null.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Guideline_2: it says \"output JSON with 'answer_to_21', 'assumptions', 'redundant_assumption: no', 'redundant_assumption_number: no', 'new_problem: no' and 'solution_for_new_problem: no'.\" This seems to suggest using the string \"no\" for these fields. But the schema allows either string or null. I'll follow the schema and use null for consistency.\n\nActually, wait - the example in the guidelines shows \"redundant_assumption: no\" (string \"no\"), not null. Let me check the schema again... The schema shows the fields can be string OR null. So \"no\" as a string is valid. I'll use \"no\" for string fields to match the guideline example.\n\nActually, re-reading: Guideline_2 says \"redundant_assumption: no\" (with colon, suggesting key-value pair where value is \"no\"). So I should use the string \"no\", not null.\n\nLet me output the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"no\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"Assumption 1: $G$ is a non-abelian group\", \"Assumption 2: $G$ is a simple group\", \"Assumption 3: The order of $G$ is less than 100\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"no\",\n  \"redundant_assumption_number\": \"no\",\n  \"new_problem\": \"no\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, \"redundant_assumption_number\" should be \"no\" as a string? The schema says it can be integer or null. Guideline_2 says \"redundant_assumption_number: no\". But \"no\" is not an integer. Maybe I should use null? Or maybe the guideline has a typo?\n\nLooking at the schema: \"redundant_assumption_number\": {\"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}]}. So it can be integer or null, not string. So I should use null, not \"no\".\n\nSimilarly for other fields: The schema shows they can be string or null. Since Guideline_2 says to use \"no\", and \"no\" is a string, that's valid for string-or-null fields. But for redundant_assumption_number which is integer-or-null, I should use null.\n\nActually, let me re-examine Guideline_2: \"output JSON with 'answer_to_21', 'assumptions', 'redundant_assumption: no', 'redundant_assumption_number: no', 'new_problem: no' and 'solution_for_new_problem: no'.\"\n\nIt says \"redundant_assumption_number: no\" but the schema says integer or null. This is inconsistent. I think the guideline has a typo. I should follow the schema: use null for redundant_assumption_number since it expects integer or null.\n\nActually, wait - maybe \"no\" is meant as a string that's not \"null\"? But the schema explicitly says type can be integer or null. So \"no\" as a string wouldn't be valid. I'll use null.\n\nFor consistency, I'll use:\n- \"redundant_assumption\": \"no\" (string \"no\")\n- \"redundant_assumption_number\": null (since schema says integer or null)\n- \"new_problem\": \"no\" (string \"no\")  \n- \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"no\" (string \"no\")\n\nActually, looking at the schema again: all the \"anyOf\" fields have \"type\": \"string\" as one option and \"type\": \"null\" as another. So \"no\" as a string is valid for all of them. Even redundant_assumption_number says \"anyOf\": [{\"type\": \"integer\"}, {\"type\": \"null\"}], so \"no\" as a string wouldn't be valid. I should use null for that one.\n\nActually, I think the guideline has an error. I'll follow the schema properly.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"no\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"Assumption 1: $G$ is a non-abelian group\", \"Assumption 2: $G$ is a simple group\", \"Assumption 3: The order of $G$ is less than 100\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"no\",\n  \"redundant_assumption_number\": null,\n  \"new_problem\": \"no\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
