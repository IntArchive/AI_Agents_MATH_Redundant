Using properties of modular arithmetic, for any non-negative integer $m$, we have:\n$$10^m \\equiv 1^m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$$\nThis follows from the fact that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a^n \\equiv b^n \\pmod{m}$ for any non-negative integer $n$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply modular arithmetic to $n$**\nNow consider $n$ modulo $3$:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv a_k \\times 10^k + a_{k-1} \\times 10^{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 10 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\\\\n&\\equiv a_k \\times 1 + a_{k-1} \\times 1 + \\cdots + a_1 \\times 1 + a_0 \\pmod{3} \\quad \\text{(by Step 2)} \\\\\n&\\equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0 \\pmod{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 4: Define the sum of digits**\nLet $S$ denote the sum of the decimal digits of $n$:\n$$S = a_k + a_{k-1} + \\cdots + a_1 + a_0$$\nThen from Step 3, we have:\n$$n \\equiv S \\pmod{3}$$\n\n**Step 5: Equivalence of divisibility conditions**\nThe congruence $n \\equiv S \\pmod{3}$ means that $n - S$ is divisible by $3$, or equivalently, $n$ and $S$ have the same remainder when divided by $3$. Therefore:\n$$3 \\mid n \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad 3 \\mid S$$\n\nThis completes the proof. We have shown that a positive integer $n$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $3$.\n\n**Additional note:** The proof also establishes the converse: if $n$ is divisible by $3$, then the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, since the congruence $n \\equiv S \\pmod{3}$ works in both directions.",
