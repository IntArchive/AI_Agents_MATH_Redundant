    "Content":"While reading an article on Hoeffding's Inequality, I came across a curious inequality. Namely $$\\cosh x \\leq e^{x^2\/2} \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$$ I tried many ways to prove it and finally, the Taylor series approach worked: $$e^x = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\cdots$$\n$$e^{-x} = 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\cdots$$\n Adding the two and dividing by 2 (This operation being justified as both series converge),\nwe get $$\\cosh x  = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!}+ \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\cdots$$ Expanding $e^{x^2\/2}$ yields $$e^{x^2\/2}  = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2!}+ \\frac{x^4}{4\\times 2!} + \\cdots$$ If you do a term by term comparison, you get the desired result. My question is: Is there another more \"Cute\"\/elegant way to get this result? If so, what is it? I tried using Jensen's Inequality but that didn't help. Also I searched for this inequality using the keywords \"cosh x\" and \"inequality\", but didn't get it. Any ideas will be appreciated.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that cosh x is less than or equal to e^(x²\/2) for all real x. They mentioned using the Taylor series expansion, which worked, but they're looking for a more elegant or \"cute\" method. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I recall that cosh x is (e^x + e^(-x))\/2. So maybe there's a way to relate this expression directly to e^(x²\/2) without expanding into series. Let me think about inequalities involving exponentials. \n\nOne approach could be to use the inequality that for any real number t, e^t ≥ 1 + t. That's the basic exponential inequality. But how does that apply here? Alternatively, maybe consider taking logarithms on both sides. If I take the natural log of both sides, the inequality becomes ln(cosh x) ≤ x²\/2. Then, perhaps show that ln(cosh x) is always less than or equal to x²\/2. But does that hold? Let's check at x=0: ln(cosh 0) = ln(1) = 0, and x²\/2 = 0, so equality holds. For small x, maybe approximate using Taylor series? The Taylor series of ln(cosh x) is x²\/2 - x^4\/12 + ... which is less than x²\/2. For large x, cosh x behaves like e^x \/ 2, so ln(cosh x) ≈ x - ln 2. Compare that to x²\/2. For large x, x²\/2 grows much faster than x, so x - ln 2 ≤ x²\/2 would hold for sufficiently large x. That might work. But is there a more straightforward way?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe use the fact that for any real y, sinh y ≤ y e^{y²\/2}. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the moment generating function or some probabilistic approach, since the original context was Hoeffding's inequality. Hoeffding's inequality uses bounded random variables and applies exponential bounds. Maybe there's a connection here.\n\nAlternatively, consider comparing the two functions directly. Let’s define f(x) = e^{x²\/2} - cosh x. We need to show that f(x) ≥ 0 for all x. Let's compute f(0) = 1 - 1 = 0. Compute the derivative f’(x) = x e^{x²\/2} - sinh x. At x=0, f’(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. The second derivative f''(x) would be e^{x²\/2} + x² e^{x²\/2} - cosh x. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe using the Taylor series for both functions and comparing term by term as the original approach did. But the user already did that and wants another method.\n\nWait, maybe using the inequality that for any t, cosh t ≤ e^{t²\/2}. If we set t = x, then that's exactly the inequality we need. But how to prove that? Maybe by considering the integral form or using some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that cosh x can be represented as the expectation of e^{xY} where Y is a random variable taking values ±1 with probability 1\/2 each. Then, by Jensen's inequality, but the user mentioned that Jensen didn't help. Alternatively, using the moment generating function and expanding it. Wait, the moment generating function of Y is E[e^{xY}] = (e^x + e^{-x})\/2 = cosh x. Then, perhaps relate this to the MGF of a normal distribution, which is e^{x²\/2}. But I'm not sure how to directly compare them.\n\nAnother approach: Use the inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean. For example, e^{x} and e^{-x}; their arithmetic mean is cosh x, and their geometric mean is 1. But that gives cosh x ≥ 1, which is not helpful here. Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's take the logarithm again. We need to show that (e^x + e^{-x})\/2 ≤ e^{x²\/2}. Taking logarithms on both sides would require care because log is monotonic, but maybe exponentiating. Alternatively, square both sides? Let's see:\n\nSquaring both sides: cosh²x ≤ e^{x²}. But cosh²x = (e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x})\/4. So comparing to e^{x²}... Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio of the two functions: cosh x \/ e^{x²\/2} ≤ 1. Let’s define g(x) = cosh x \/ e^{x²\/2}. We need to show that g(x) ≤ 1 for all x. Check at x=0: g(0) = 1 \/ 1 = 1. Compute derivative g’(x). Let’s compute:\n\ng’(x) = [sinh x * e^{x²\/2} - cosh x * x e^{x²\/2}] \/ e^{x²}\n\nSimplify numerator: sinh x - x cosh x. So g’(x) = (sinh x - x cosh x) \/ e^{x²\/2}\n\nNow, we can analyze the sign of g’(x). For x > 0, let's see sinh x = (e^x - e^{-x})\/2, cosh x = (e^x + e^{-x})\/2. So sinh x - x cosh x = [e^x - e^{-x}]\/2 - x[e^x + e^{-x}]\/2. Factor out 1\/2: [ (e^x - e^{-x}) - x(e^x + e^{-x}) ] \/ 2.\n\nLet’s denote h(x) = (e^x - e^{-x}) - x(e^x + e^{-x}). We can analyze h(x). Compute h(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. Compute h’(x) = (e^x + e^{-x}) - [ (e^x + e^{-x}) + x(e^x - e^{-x}) ] = (e^x + e^{-x}) - (e^x + e^{-x}) - x(e^x - e^{-x}) = -x(e^x - e^{-x}).\n\nFor x > 0, e^x > e^{-x}, so h’(x) = -x(positive) < 0. So h(x) is decreasing for x > 0. Since h(0)=0 and decreasing, h(x) < 0 for x > 0. Hence, numerator sinh x - x cosh x < 0 for x > 0. Therefore, g’(x) < 0 for x > 0. Similarly, for x < 0, since cosh is even and sinh is odd, we can check that the derivative would be positive for x < 0, but let me verify:\n\nFor x < 0, let x = -y where y > 0. Then sinh(-y) = -sinh y, cosh(-y) = cosh y. So h(-y) = ( -sinh y ) - (-y) cosh y = -sinh y + y cosh y. Which is the negative of h(y) when x > 0. Since h(y) < 0, then h(-y) = -h(y) > 0. Therefore, for x < 0, h(x) > 0, so g’(x) = h(x)\/e^{x²\/2} > 0. Thus, g(x) increases for x < 0 and decreases for x > 0, with maximum at x=0 where g(0)=1. Therefore, g(x) ≤ 1 for all x. Hence proved.\n\nThat seems like a valid approach using calculus. Maybe this is the \"cute\" method the user is looking for. Alternatively, using the fact that the derivative shows the maximum is at zero and then decreases on both sides. So that could be a method without expanding Taylor series. Let me check if there's another way.\n\nAnother possible method: Using the inequality 1 + t ≤ e^t. Let’s consider the expression for cosh x. We have cosh x = E[e^{xY}] where Y is ±1 with probability 1\/2 each. Then, using Hoeffding's lemma, which states that for a random variable Y with |Y| ≤ 1, the log of the moment generating function is bounded by ψ(t) ≤ t²\/2. So ln E[e^{tY}] ≤ t²\/2. Taking exponential on both sides gives E[e^{tY}] ≤ e^{t²\/2}, which is exactly the inequality we need. So this is a reference to Hoeffding's lemma itself, which might be the elegant method given the original context was Hoeffding's inequality. That would tie it back to the article the user was reading. That's probably the more elegant method they were looking for, connecting it directly to the lemma used in Hoeffding's proof.",

This is the standard mathematical notation where $e^y$ denotes the exponential function evaluated at $y$.\\n\\n2. **Domain consideration**: By Assumption 1, $x$ is a real number.
