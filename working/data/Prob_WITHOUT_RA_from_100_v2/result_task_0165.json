    "Content":"I am confused about complex numbers. Does $1-i$ lie outside the unit circle? How do I show that the absolute value of $1-i$ is larger than that of $1$ ?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let me do something very different for me. Let me give a geometric proof: Note that $1-i$ is the bottom-right corner of the square whose center is $0$ and whose edges have length $2$. The other corners are $1+i; -1+i; -1-i$. The diagonal running from $-1+i$ to $1-i$ is a straight line passing through $0$. Its length, by the Pythagoras theorem, is $2\\sqrt2=\\sqrt8$. Therefore the distance between $0$ and each of the corners is exactly half, i.e. $\\sqrt2$. And it is trivial to see that $\\sqrt2>1$. Here is a drawing: $\\hspace{5cm}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants to know if |1 - i| is larger than |1| and how to show that. First, I need to recall how absolute values work for complex numbers. The absolute value, or modulus, of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²). So for 1 - i, which is the same as 1 + (-1)i, the modulus would be sqrt(1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). The modulus of 1, which is a real number, is just sqrt(1² + 0²) = 1. Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, which is greater than 1, that means |1 - i| is indeed larger than |1|. But wait, the original problem in the example had assumptions listed. Let me check the formatting again. The user provided an example where assumptions were listed, even if they weren't all explicitly stated in the original problem. In the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just said \"for every integer n\". So maybe I need to list assumptions here too. Let's see. The problem here is comparing |1 - i| and |1|. The assumptions would be that we're dealing with complex numbers, and the modulus is defined in the standard way. But since the user wants each assumption to address one property or condition applied to one object, perhaps I should break it down. Let me think: the complex numbers in question are 1 - i and 1. The modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a² + b²). So for 1 - i, a = 1, b = -1. For 1, a = 1, b = 0. Therefore, the assumptions would be that the modulus is defined as sqrt(a² + b²) for each complex number. But maybe the user wants each assumption as a separate line. So for the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\n1 - i is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part -1,\n1 is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 0,\nThe modulus of a complex number a + bi is calculated as sqrt(a² + b²).\n\nBut wait, the original problem doesn't mention the modulus definition; it's a standard part of complex numbers. But in the example provided, the assumption included that n is divisible by 7 even though the original problem didn't state that. Wait, the example had an original problem that said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, looking back, the original example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user's formatted problem added the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But in reality, the original problem didn't state that; it just said \"for every integer n\". So maybe there was an error in the example, or perhaps the user intended to include additional assumptions. Hmm. This is confusing. Wait, perhaps the example was incorrect. But regardless, the user's instruction is to structure the problem as per the format, listing all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So in the given example, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to restructure the problem with necessary assumptions. But in the current problem, the user is asking about |1 - i| vs |1|. The assumptions needed here would be:\n\n- 1 - i is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part -1.\n\n- 1 is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 0.\n\n- The modulus of a complex number is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts.\n\nBut maybe the original problem doesn't mention the modulus definition, so to structure it properly, we need to list those as assumptions. However, in the example, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, but it was included in the formatted assumption. That suggests that maybe the user wants to include implicit assumptions necessary for solving the problem. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But 91 is 13*7. So perhaps the user split the problem into assumptions that n is divisible by 7 and 13? Wait, no. The example's formatted assumption lists n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. That seems incorrect. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the example was for a different problem. Regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the current problem according to the format, listing assumptions line by line. So for the problem \"Is |1 - i| larger than |1|? Show that |1 - i| > |1|\", the assumptions would be:\n\n- 1 - i is a complex number.\n\n- 1 is a complex number.\n\n- The modulus (absolute value) of a complex number a + bi is defined as sqrt(a² + b²).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption addressing one property or object. Then the problem is to show that |1 - i| > |1|. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\n1 - i is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part -1,\n1 is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 0,\nThe modulus of a complex number a + bi is calculated as sqrt(a² + b²).\nProblem:\nProve that |1 - i| is larger than |1|.\n\nBut maybe the user wants even more atomic assumptions. For instance, breaking down the modulus definition into parts. However, the example given in the user's query had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each line is a separate condition. Applying that here, the complex numbers 1 - i and 1 have their real and imaginary parts specified separately. So each part could be a separate assumption. Let me check:\n\nOriginal problem: Is |1 - i| larger than |1|? How to show that?\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- 1 - i is a complex number where the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is -1.\n\n- 1 is a complex number where the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is 0.\n\n- The modulus of a complex number is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts.\n\nEach of these is a separate line. That seems to fit the format. The problem then is to prove that |1 - i| > |1|. So the formatted problem would have those three assumptions and then the problem statement.",
