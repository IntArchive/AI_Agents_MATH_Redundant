By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these fractional parts must fall into the same subinterval.\n\n7. **Identify the two fractional parts:** Let i and j be distinct integers with 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N+1 such that {i√2} and {j√2} lie in the same subinterval. Without loss of generality, assume i > j.\n\n8. **Bound on their difference:** Since both {i√2} and {j√2} are in the same subinterval of length 1/N, we have:\n   |{i√2} - {j√2}| < 1/N < ε.\n\n9. **Construct x ∈ S:** Define:\n   x = {i√2} - {j√2}\n     = (i√2 - ⌊i√2⌋) - (j√2 - ⌊j√2⌋)\n     = (i - j)√2 - (⌊i√2⌋ - ⌊j√2⌋).\n\n10. **Show x ∈ S:** Let n = i - j and m = -(⌊i√2⌋ - ⌊j√2⌋). Since i and j are integers, n = i - j ∈ ℤ. Since ⌊i√2⌋ and ⌊j√2⌋ are integers, m = -(⌊i√2⌋ - ⌊j√2⌋) ∈ ℤ. Therefore,\n    x = m + n√2 ∈ S.\n\n11. **Show 0 < |x| < ε:**\n    - First, note that x ≠ 0 because if x = 0, then {i√2} = {j√2}, which would imply (i - j)√2 is an integer. Since √2 is irrational and i - j is a nonzero integer, (i - j)√2 cannot be an integer. Thus x ≠ 0.\n    - From step 8, we have |x| = |{i√2} - {j√2}| < 1/N < ε.\n    - To see that x > 0, note that since i > j and √2 > 0, we have i√2 > j√2. However, we need to consider the fractional parts. Since {i√2} and {j√2} are in the same subinterval, we cannot immediately conclude which is larger. But we can ensure positivity by taking the absolute value if necessary. Actually, if {i√2} ≥ {j√2}, then x ≥ 0, and since x ≠ 0, we have x > 0. If {i√2} < {j√2}, then x < 0, but we can simply swap i and j in our construction to get a positive x. Alternatively, we can note that the absolute value |x| gives a positive element of S with |x| < ε, and since S is symmetric (if x ∈ S then -x ∈ S), we can obtain a positive element.\n\n12. **Conclusion:** For the given ε > 0, we have constructed an element x ∈ S with 0 < |x| < ε. Since ε was arbitrary, this shows that S intersects (0, ε) for every ε > 0. In other words, S contains arbitrarily small positive numbers.\n\n**Additional note:** The proof relies on the irrationality of √2, which ensures that the fractional parts {k√2} are all distinct. If √2 were rational, the set S would be discrete and would not contain arbitrarily small positive elements.",
