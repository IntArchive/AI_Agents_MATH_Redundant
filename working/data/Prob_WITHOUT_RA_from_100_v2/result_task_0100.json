    "Content":"Let us define a properly discontinuous action of a group $G$ on a topological space $X$ as an action such that every $x \\in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$ implies $g = e$. I would like to prove that this property is equivalent to, having given $G$ the discrete topology and in the $X$ locally compact Hausdorff case, the map $G \\times X \\rightarrow X \\times X$ given by $(g, x) \\mapsto (x, gx)$ being proper (i.e. closed and preimage of compact sets is compact) plus the action being free. I have managed to prove one direction, that is, if the action is proper and free with $G$ having the discrete topology then it is properly discontinuous. I'm having trouble though with the other direction. Here is an attempt: let's denote by $\\rho : G \\times X \\rightarrow X \\times X$ the map $\\rho(g, x) = (x, gx)$. Suppose $K \\subset X \\times X$ is compact. We wish to show $\\rho^{-1}(K)$ is compact. Let $(g_i, x_i)$ be a net in $\\rho^{-1}(K)$. Then $\\rho(g_i, x_i) = (x_i, g_i x_i)$ admits a convergent subnet, so passing to it we may assume $x_i \\rightarrow x$ and $g_i x_i \\rightarrow y$. Essentially we must now find a way to prove $g_i$ converges, but I can't seem to do this. Any hints?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"These properties are not equivalent. Here's a counterexample: Let $X=\\mathbb R^2\\smallsetminus\\{(0,0)\\}$, and define an action of $\\mathbb Z$ on $X$ by $n\\cdot (x,y) = (2^n x, 2^{-n} y)$. This is properly discontinuous by your definition, but it's not a proper action. The subset $K \\times K \\subseteq X\\times X$ is compact, where $K = \\{(x,y): \\max(|x|,|y|)=1\\}$,   but $\\rho^{-1}(K\\times K)$ contains the sequence $(n, (2^{-n},1))$, which has no convergent subsequence. I think one reason for your confusion is that different authors give different definitions of \"properly discontinuous.\" Topologists concerned primarily with actions that determine covering maps often give the definition you gave: (i) Every $x \\in X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$ implies $g = e$. This is necessary and sufficient for the quotient map $X\\to X\/G$ to be a covering map. However, in order for the action to be proper (and thus for the quotient space to be Hausdorff), an additional condition is needed: (ii) If $x,x'\\in X$ are not in the same $G$-orbit, then there exist neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ and $U'$ of $x'$ such that $gU\\cap U' = \\emptyset$ for all $g\\in G$. When $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $G$ is a discrete group acting freely on $X$, the action is proper if and only if both conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied. Differential geometers, who are typically concerned with forming quotient spaces that are manifolds, are more apt to define \"properly discontinuous\" to mean both (i) and (ii) are satisfied. Because of this ambiguity (and because the term \"properly discontinuous\" leads to oxymoronic phrases such as \"a continuous properly discontinuous action\"), Allen Hatcher in his Algebraic Topology coined the term covering space action for an action satisfying condition (i). I've adopted that terminology, and I use free and proper action for an action satisfying (i) and (ii) (at least for locally compact Hausdorff spaces). I sincerely hope the term properly discontinuous will eventually die out. You can find more about these issues in the second editions of my books Introduction to Topological Manifolds (Chapter 12) and Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (Chapter 21).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about equivalent definitions of a properly discontinuous group action. The original definition they give is that every point x in X has a neighborhood U such that if gU intersects U non-trivially, then g must be the identity element. They want to show that this is equivalent to the action being proper (with G discrete and X locally compact Hausdorff) and free.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions. A properly discontinuous action, in some sources, is often defined such that the action is proper and free when G is discrete. But here, the user has a specific definition and wants to show equivalence. The problem splits into two directions: proving that a proper free action implies the given definition of properly discontinuous, which they've done, and the converse, which they're struggling with.\n\nThe user's attempt is to consider the map ρ: G×X → X×X given by (g,x) ↦ (x,gx). Properness here means that the preimage of a compact set is compact. Since G has the discrete topology, compactness in G×X is equivalent to finite subsets. So, for K compact in X×X, ρ⁻¹(K) should be a finite set of points in G×X.\n\nBut the user is using nets to approach this. They take a net (g_i, x_i) in ρ⁻¹(K), so (x_i, g_i x_i) is in K. Since K is compact, there's a convergent subnet, so x_i → x and g_i x_i → y. They need to show that g_i converges in G. Since G is discrete, convergence implies that g_i is eventually constant. So, if they can show that g_i stabilizes to some g, then (g, x) would be the limit point in ρ⁻¹(K), proving compactness.\n\nBut why would g_i stabilize? Because the action is properly discontinuous in the original sense. Let's see. Take x in X. There exists a neighborhood U of x such that gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ implies g = e. Now, since x_i → x, eventually x_i is in U. Suppose g_i x_i → y. If y is in X, which is Hausdorff, then perhaps using local compactness to separate points and group elements. But how to relate this to the original definition?\n\nAlternatively, since the action is free, if g_i x = x, then g_i is e. But here, we have g_i x_i approaching y. Maybe using the fact that X is Hausdorff and locally compact, we can find neighborhoods that separate the group elements. If the action is properly discontinuous, then for each x, there's a neighborhood U where only e translates U to overlap with U. As x_i approaches x, perhaps the g_i can't be infinitely many distinct elements because otherwise, their translates would intersect U infinitely often, contradicting the properly discontinuous assumption.\n\nWait, the user's original definition is that for every x, there's a neighborhood U where gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ only when g = e. So if we have g_i x_i in a compact set K, and x_i approaching x, then for large i, x_i is in U. Then g_i x_i is in K, which is compact. If K is compact in X×X, then the projection onto the second coordinate is also compact. So y would be in the projection. But since X is Hausdorff and locally compact, maybe we can use the proper discontinuity to show that only finitely many g_i can map x_i into the compact set containing y. Because otherwise, infinitely many g_i would move x_i (which are near x) into a neighborhood of y, which might require that g_i sends a neighborhood of x to a neighborhood of y. But since the action is properly discontinuous, there can't be infinitely many such g_i.\n\nAlternatively, since G is discrete, the set {g_i} must be finite, otherwise, it would have no convergent subnet. Because in a discrete group, only finite subsets are compact. So if the preimage ρ⁻¹(K) had infinitely many group elements, then it would not be compact. But since the action is properly discontinuous, maybe the number of g's such that gK' ∩ K' is non-empty is finite for K' compact. Hmm.\n\nBut I think the key point is to use the original definition of properly discontinuous to show that only finitely many group elements can map points near x into a compact set. So given K compact in X×X, the first projection is compact in X, say K1, and the second projection K2. For each x in K1, take a neighborhood U_x where only e translates U_x to intersect U_x. By compactness, cover K1 with finitely many such U_x. Then, any g that maps a point in K1 to K2 must have g in a finite set, otherwise, it would contradict the properly discontinuous condition. Therefore, the g_i can only take finitely many values, hence the net (g_i, x_i) must eventually be in a finite subset of G, hence convergent.\n\nBut I need to structure this as assumptions and problem. The problem is to prove the equivalence between the two definitions. The assumptions would be the conditions given: G has discrete topology, X is locally compact Hausdorff, the action is free, and the map ρ is proper. Wait, the problem is to show that the original definition (neighborhoods with only trivial stabilizers) is equivalent to the action being free and the map ρ being proper. So the user needs to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nIn the example given, the user filtered out some parts. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the problem statement, that wasn't mentioned. Wait, no, in the example, the formatted problem lists assumptions as n is integer, n divisible by 7, and the problem is to prove divisibility by 91. But in the original problem, the user had for every integer n, but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps that example is incorrect? Or maybe the original problem had a hidden assumption.\n\nBut in this case, the user's problem is to show equivalence between two definitions. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem: G is a group with discrete topology, X is locally compact Hausdorff, the action is free, and the map ρ is proper. But actually, the problem is to show that the properly discontinuous action (as defined) is equivalent to the action being free and proper (with G discrete and X locally compact Hausdorff). So the user wants to structure this as assumptions and problem.\n\nSo the assumptions would include:\n\n- G is a group with discrete topology.\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- The action of G on X is free.\n\n- The map ρ: G×X → X×X given by (g,x) ↦ (x,gx) is proper.\n\nBut the problem is to prove that this is equivalent to the original definition of properly discontinuous. Wait, the user's problem is in two directions: one is already proven (proper and free implies properly discontinuous), and they need to prove the converse (properly discontinuous implies proper and free). But the problem as stated in the question is to show equivalence. So perhaps the assumptions are split accordingly.\n\nWait, the user's original problem is to prove that the definition of properly discontinuous (neighborhoods with gU ∩ U non-empty only if g=e) is equivalent to, when G is discrete and X is locally compact Hausdorff, the action being free and the map ρ being proper. So the two directions are:\n\n1. If the action is free and proper (map ρ is proper), then it is properly discontinuous (as per the original definition).\n\n2. Conversely, if the action is properly discontinuous (original definition), then the action is free and the map ρ is proper.\n\nBut the user has done direction 1 and is stuck on direction 2. So the problem is to prove the equivalence, but specifically the user is asking about direction 2.\n\nBut when structuring the problem, the assumptions should include all the conditions given in the problem. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question:\n\n\"Let us define a properly discontinuous action of a group G on a topological space X as an action such that every x ∈ X has a neighborhood U such that gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ implies g = e. I would like to prove that this property is equivalent to, having given G the discrete topology and in the X locally compact Hausdorff case, the map G × X → X × X given by (g, x) ↦ (x, gx) being proper (i.e. closed and preimage of compact sets is compact) plus the action being free. [...]\"\n\nSo the equivalence is between:\n\n- Properly discontinuous action as per the definition given.\n\n- The action is free and the map (g,x) ↦ (x,gx) is proper, with G discrete and X locally compact Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to show that when G is discrete and X is locally compact Hausdorff, the following are equivalent:\n\n1. The action is properly discontinuous (every x has a neighborhood U with gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ only if g=e).\n\n2. The action is free and the map ρ is proper.\n\nBut the user is stuck on proving that 1 implies 2. So structuring this as per the required format:\n\nAssumptions need to list all conditions given. The problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user's specific question is about proving that a properly discontinuous action (as defined) implies the action is free and ρ is proper. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- G is a group with discrete topology.\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- The action of G on X is properly discontinuous (every x has a neighborhood U with gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ ⇒ g=e).\n\nProblem: Prove that the action is free and the map ρ: G×X → X×X defined by (g,x) ↦ (x,gx) is proper.\n\nBut the original problem statement mentions the equivalence. However, the example given in the user's instruction shows that sometimes assumptions are listed even if they are part of the problem's conditions. For example, in the example, the assumption was added that n is divisible by 7, even though the original problem said \"for every integer n\". But perhaps in that case, there was a mistake. However, in our case, the problem's conditions include that G is discrete and X is locally compact Hausdorff. So those are given as part of the problem's setup.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n\nG is a group equipped with the discrete topology,\n\nX is a locally compact Hausdorff space,\n\nThe action of G on X is properly discontinuous (i.e., every x ∈ X has a neighborhood U such that gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ implies g = e).\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the action of G on X is free and the map ρ: G×X → X×X defined by (g, x) ↦ (x, gx) is proper.\n\nBut wait, the action being free is part of what needs to be proven, so it's not an assumption. The original problem's equivalent conditions are: properly discontinuous (as defined) vs. action is free and map is proper (with G discrete and X l.c.H.). So the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem (G discrete, X l.c.H, action is properly discontinuous), and the problem is to prove that the action is free and the map is proper.\n\nBut in the example provided by the user, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, which was not in the original problem statement. That seems to be an error. However, in our case, the user's problem does include the conditions (G discrete, X l.c.H.), which are part of the equivalence's hypotheses. So those are the assumptions.\n\nBut the problem is to prove the equivalence. However, the user has split it into two directions. Since the user is struggling with the direction: properly discontinuous (as defined) implies action is free and map is proper. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would include G discrete, X l.c.H, action is properly discontinuous, and the problem is to show the action is free and map is proper.\n\nBut the user's specific question is about this direction, so the formatted problem should reflect that. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group with the discrete topology.\n\n- X is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n\n- The action of G on X is properly discontinuous (every x has a neighborhood U where gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ ⇒ g = e).\n\nProblem:\n\nProve that the action is free and the map ρ: G × X → X × X defined by ρ(g, x) = (x, gx) is proper.\n\nYes, that's correct. The assumptions are the given conditions, and the problem is to prove the two conclusions: freeness and properness of the map.",

Recall the definitions:\n\n**Definition (Free Action):** An action of a group $G$ on a space $X$ is called free if for every $x \\in X$ and every $g \\in G$, if $g \\cdot x = x$, then $g = e$ (where $e$ is the identity element of $G$).\n\n**Definition (Properly Discontinuous Action):** An action of a discrete group $G$ on a topological space $X$ is properly discontinuous if for every $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that for all $g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, we have $gU \\cap U = \\emptyset$. Equivalently, $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$ implies $g = e$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Assume the action is properly discontinuous.** By definition, for every $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that for all $g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, we have $gU_x \\cap U_x = \\emptyset$.\n\n2. **Take any $x \\in X$ and any $g \\in G$ such that $g \\cdot x = x$.** We need to show that $g = e$.\n\n3. **Apply the properly discontinuous condition to $x$.** Since the action is properly discontinuous, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ (we can take $U = U_x$ from step 1) with the property that for all $h \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, $hU \\cap U = \\emptyset$.\n\n4. **Analyze the condition $g \\cdot x = x$.** Since $x \\in U$ (as $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$) and $g \\cdot x = x$, we have:\n   - $x \\in U$ (by definition of neighborhood)\n   - $x = g \\cdot x \\in gU$ (since $g \\cdot x$ is the image of $x$ under the action of $g$, and $gU = \\{g \\cdot y : y \\in U\\}$)\n\n5. **Therefore, $x \\in gU \\cap U$.** This shows that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$, since it contains at least the point $x$.\n\n6. **Apply the property of $U$ from step 3.** The neighborhood $U$ has the property that for all $h \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, $hU \\cap U = \\emptyset$. Since we have established that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$, the only possibility is that $g \\notin G \\setminus \\{e\\}$.\n\n7. **Conclude $g = e$.** If $g \\notin G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, then $g$ must be the identity element $e$.\n\n8. **General conclusion.** Since $x \\in X$ and $g \\in G$ with $g \\cdot x = x$ were arbitrary, we have shown that for all $x \\in X$ and all $g \\in G$, if $g \\cdot x = x$, then $g = e$. This is precisely the definition of a free action.\n\nThus, we have proved that a properly discontinuous action is necessarily free. The proof uses only the definition of properly discontinuous action and does not require the additional assumptions that $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff or that $G$ has the discrete topology (though these are typically part of the context for properly discontinuous actions).",
