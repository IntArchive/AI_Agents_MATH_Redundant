    "Content":"How to show that $x^4+1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb Z[x]$ but it is reducible modulo every prime $p$? For example I know that $x^4+1=(x+1)^4\\bmod 2$. Also $\\bmod 3$ we have that $0,1,2$ are not solutions of $x^4+1=0$ then if it is reducible the factors are of degree $2$. This gives that $x^4+1=(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$ and solving this system of equations $\\bmod 3$  gives that $x^4+1=(x^2+x+2) (x^2+2x+2) \\pmod 3$. But is there a simpler method to factor $x^4+1$ modulo a prime $p$?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"For every odd prime $p$ we have $8\\mid p^2-1$. The multiplicative group of the finite field $F=GF(p^2)$ is cyclic of order $p^2-1$. Putting these two bits together tells us that there is a primitive root $u$ of order $8$ in $F$. We must have $u^4=-1$, because $-1$ is the only element of multiplicative order two. Because $F$ is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbf{Z}\/p\\mathbf{Z}$, the minimal polynomial of $u$ is of degree $\\le 2$. That minimal polynomial is then a factor of \n$$x^4+1=(x-u)(x-u^3)(x-u^5)(x-u^7)=(x-u)(x-u^3)(x+u)(x+u^3).$$ ==================== Edit: Here's an idea for finding the factorization. I split it into cases according to the residue class of $p$ modulo 8. Assume first that $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 4$ (or $p$ equivalent to $1$ or $5$ modulo 8). In that case all we need is a square root $i$ of $-1$ modulo $p$. IIRC there is an algorithm for finding two integers $x,y$ such that $p=x^2+y^2$, and then $i=x*y^{-1}$ is the desired square root in the prime field $F_p=GF(p)$. A factorization is then\n$$\nx^4+1=(x^2+i)(x^2-i).\n$$\nObserve that if $p\\equiv1\\pmod8$ then both quadratic factors will split further. If $p\\equiv 3\\pmod 8$, then $u$ is not in the prime field, and its conjugate is $u^p=u^3$. Therefore the minimal polynomial is\n$$\nm(x)=(x-u)(x-u^p)=(x-u)(x-u^3)=x^2-[u+u^3]x + u^4= x^2-ax-1,\n$$\nwhere $a$ is some unknown element of the prime field. Because $u^5=-u$ and $u^7=-u^3$, the other factor of $x^4+1$ must be $m(-x)=x^2+ax-1$. We need to find the coefficient $a$.\nLet's multiply\n$$\n(x^2-ax-1)(x^2+ax-1)=(x^2-1)^2-a^2x^2=x^4-(2+a^2)x^2+1.\n$$\nWe see that we have found the factorization, if we can find $a=\\sqrt{-2}$. It is well known that when $p\\equiv 3\\pmod 8$, then $-2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$ confirming our finding. In the last case $p\\equiv 7\\pmod8$ the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $F_p$ is\n$$\nm(x)=(x-u)(x-u^p)=(x-u)(x-u^7)=x^2-[u+u^7]x+u^8=x^2-bx+1\n$$\nfor some $b\\in F_p$. Again the other factor is $m(-x)$, and a similar calculation shows that we need $b=\\sqrt{2}$. Again this fits together with the known fact that in this case $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. ================== Edit(2): TonyK described the following methods for finding the square roots. They depend on the fact that if $p$ is an odd prime, and $gcd(a,p)=1$, then $a^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv\\pm1\\pmod p$. Here we have the plus sign, if and only if $a$ is a quadratic residue (=QR) modulo $p$. If $p\\equiv 3\\pmod8$, then we know that $2$ is not a QR modulo $p$. Therefore\n$2^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv -1\\pmod p$. Hence $2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv -2\\pmod p$. But here $(p+1)\/2$ is an even integer, so writing $z=2^{(p+1)\/4}$ we get $z^2\\equiv 2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv -2$, and we have found a square root of $-2$. Similarly, if $p\\equiv 7\\pmod 8$, we know that $2$ is a quadratic residue modulo $p$. This time $2^{(p+1)\/2}\\equiv 2$, and the same calculation shows that $z=2^{(p+1)\/4}$ is a square root of $2$ in $F_p$. If $p\\equiv 5\\pmod 8$, then again $2$ is not a QR modulo $p$, so $2^{(p-1)\/2}\\equiv -1\\pmod p$ and $(p-1)\/2$ is even. Thus $z=2^{(p-1)\/4}$ is a square root of $-1$. If $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 8$, then we cannot use $2$ (but could use any non-QR in its place, or the method mentioned earlier).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking two things: first, to show that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\) (meaning it can't be factored into lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients), and second, to prove that it becomes reducible modulo every prime \\( p \\). They also mentioned wanting a simpler method to factor it modulo primes.\n\nStarting with the irreducibility over \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\). I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is the 8th cyclotomic polynomial. Cyclotomic polynomials are irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which by Gauss's lemma implies they're also irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). So maybe that's the route. Alternatively, perhaps trying to factor it into quadratics or cubics and showing it's impossible.\n\nSuppose \\( x^4 + 1 \\) factors into quadratics: \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\). Expanding gives \\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\). Setting coefficients equal to \\( x^4 + 1 \\), we get:\n\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\)\n3. \\( ad + bc = 0 \\)\n4. \\( bd = 1 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1, \\( c = -a \\). Plugging into equation 4, since \\( bd = 1 \\), possible integer solutions are \\( b = 1, d = 1 \\) or \\( b = -1, d = -1 \\). Let's try \\( b = 1, d = 1 \\). Then equation 2 becomes \\( -a^2 + 1 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow -a^2 + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 2 \\). But \\( a \\) must be integer, so no solution. Similarly, if \\( b = -1, d = -1 \\), equation 2 becomes \\( -a^2 -1 -1 = 0 \\Rightarrow -a^2 -2 = 0 \\), which is impossible. Hence, no quadratic factors. Similarly, trying linear factors would require roots, but \\( x^4 +1 =0 \\) has roots which are 8th roots of unity, not integers, so no linear factors over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Thus, irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nNow for reducibility modulo every prime \\( p \\). The user showed examples mod 2 and 3. For mod 2, \\( x^4 +1 = (x+1)^4 \\). For mod 3, they factored into two quadratics. The question is how to do this in general. Maybe using properties of finite fields. For a prime \\( p \\), in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p[x] \\), \\( x^4 +1 \\) factors depending on the value of \\( p \\) modulo 8. Because the polynomial splits into linear or quadratic factors based on the multiplicative order of certain elements.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( x^4 +1 = (x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x +1)(x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x +1) \\), but in finite fields, square roots exist depending on the field. For primes where 2 is a quadratic residue, this would factor. But 2 is a quadratic residue mod p if \\( p \\equiv \\pm1 \\mod 8 \\). Wait, but maybe another approach: \\( x^4 +1 = (x^2 +1)^2 - 2x^2 = (x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x +1)(x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x +1) \\). So if 2 is a square in \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), then this factors into quadratics. If not, maybe another method. Also, \\( x^4 +1 \\) divides \\( x^8 -1 \\), so it's related to the 8th roots of unity. In a field \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\), the multiplicative group is cyclic of order \\( p-1 \\), so if 8 divides \\( p-1 \\), then there are primitive 8th roots, so \\( x^4 +1 \\) splits into linear factors. If not, maybe into quadratics. Wait, but regardless of the prime, it seems reducible. Let's check primes:\n\nCase 1: p=2. As shown, \\( x^4 +1 = (x+1)^4 \\).\n\nCase 2: p is odd. If p ≡ 1 mod 8, then 8 divides p-1, so multiplicative group has elements of order 8, hence x^4 +1 splits into linear factors.\n\nIf p ≡ 3,5,7 mod 8, then 8 doesn't divide p-1. For example, p ≡ 3 mod 4, then p ≡ 3 mod 8 or 7 mod 8. Wait, perhaps need to check:\n\nFor primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8: splits into 4 linear factors.\n\np ≡ 5 mod 8: Then 8 divides p^2 -1, since p^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 1 mod 8, so p^2 -1 ≡ 0 mod 8. So in the field extension \\( \\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \\), the multiplicative group has order p^2 -1, which is divisible by 8, so there are 8th roots of unity. Therefore, the polynomial x^4 +1 factors into quadratics over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\).\n\nSimilarly, for p ≡ 3 mod 8, p^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 1 mod 8, so same as above. So in these cases, x^4 +1 factors into quadratics over \\( \\mathbb{F}_p \\). Hence, modulo any prime, x^4 +1 is reducible.\n\nBut how to give a simple method for factoring? Maybe note that for any prime p, either -1 is a quadratic residue or not. Wait, but -1 is a quadratic residue mod p if p ≡ 1 mod 4. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, use the fact that in any field, x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 + ax +1)(x^2 - ax +1) if there exists an a such that a^2 = 2. Alternatively, if 2 is a square, which is when p ≡ ±1 mod 8. If 2 is not a square, maybe another approach. Wait, but if 2 is not a square, perhaps -2 is a square? Let's see: For example, when p=3, 2 is not a square (since 1^2=1, 2^2=4≡1 mod 3), but -2 ≡1 mod 3, which is a square. Wait, but in p=3, 1 is a square. Wait, maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, note that x^4 +1 = (x^2 +1)^2 - 2x^2, so if 2 is a square, then it factors as difference of squares. If not, maybe factors another way. Alternatively, x^4 +1 = (x^4 + 2x^2 +1) - 2x^2 = (x^2 +1)^2 - (√2 x)^2, so if 2 is a square, factor as (x^2 +√2 x +1)(x^2 -√2 x +1). If 2 is not a square, then maybe use other methods. Wait, but for primes where 2 is not a square, maybe use that x^4 +1 can be written as (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). However, solving for coefficients might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for primes where p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a quadratic residue. But x^4 +1 can be factored as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)), but if sqrt(-1) doesn't exist, then maybe combine into quadratics. Wait, in p ≡ 3 mod 4, -1 is not a quadratic residue, so sqrt(-1) isn't in F_p. But then, x^4 +1 factors into quadratics as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)) over F_p^2. But over F_p, maybe as (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). Let's take p=3, as in the example. The user found x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2). Multiply them out: x^4 + (1+2)x^3 + (2 + 2 + 4)x^2 + (4 + 2)x + 4. Wait, modulo 3, coefficients:\n\nFirst term: x^4.\n\nSecond term: (1+2)x^3 = 0x^3.\n\nThird term: (2 +2 +4)x^2 = 8x^2 ≡ 2x^2 mod 3.\n\nFourth term: (4 +2)x = 6x ≡ 0x mod3.\n\nConstant term: 4 ≡1 mod3. So total: x^4 +2x^2 +1. But x^4 +1 is x^4 +1. Wait, but 2x^2 ≡ -x^2 mod3. So x^4 -x^2 +1. Hmm, not the same as x^4 +1. Wait, maybe the user's example is incorrect? Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal problem statement says: In mod3, x^4 +1 factors as (x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2). Let's multiply these:\n\n(x^2 +x +2)(x^2 +2x +2) = x^4 +2x^3 +2x^2 +x^3 +2x^2 +2x +2x^2 +4x +4.\n\nCombine terms modulo3:\n\nx^4 + (2+1)x^3 + (2+2+2)x^2 + (2+4)x +4\n\n= x^4 +0x^3 + (6)x^2 +6x +4\n\n= x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x +1\n\n= x^4 +1. Yes, correct. So in this case, the cross terms cancel out. Interesting. So perhaps there's a general method where for primes not congruent to 1 mod8, you can still find such factorizations. Maybe by trying to set up the equations for the coefficients and solve them in F_p. Alternatively, use the fact that x^4 +1 splits into quadratic factors if the field has a certain extension degree.\n\nBut the user is asking for a simpler method. Maybe note that x^4 +1 = x^4 - (-1), and so over F_p, if -1 is a square, say -1 = a^2, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 +a)(x^2 -a). If -1 is not a square, then maybe factor into quadratics (x^2 +ax +b)(x^2 +cx +d). Alternatively, use the fact that for any prime p, either 2 is a square, -2 is a square, or something else. Wait, perhaps using the identity x^4 +1 = (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1) when 2 is a square, and another identity when 2 is not a square. For example, if -1 is a square, then factor as (x^2 + sqrt(-1))(x^2 - sqrt(-1)), but that would require sqrt(-1) to exist. For primes p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue, so this would work. But if p ≡3 mod4, then -1 is not a residue. But in that case, maybe use another method. Alternatively, note that x^4 +1 factors as (x+1)^4 when p=2. For odd primes, perhaps use the fact that in F_p, x^4 +1 divides x^8 -1, which splits into linear factors if 8 divides p-1 or into quadratic factors otherwise. So depending on p mod8:\n\n- If p ≡1 mod8, splits into 4 linear factors.\n\n- If p ≡5 mod8, splits into two quadratics.\n\n- If p ≡3 or7 mod8, splits into two quadratics.\n\nWait, but how to see this? Maybe using the fact that the order of 2 modulo p affects the factorization. Alternatively, considering the field extensions. If the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p is k, then in F_p, x^4 +1 factors accordingly. But this might be too advanced. Maybe a simpler way is to note that for any odd prime p, either 2 is a quadratic residue or not. If 2 is a quadratic residue (i.e., p ≡ ±1 mod8), then x^4 +1 factors into (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1). If 2 is not a quadratic residue, then -2 is a quadratic residue (since the product of two non-residues is a residue; if p ≡3,5 mod8, then 2 is a non-residue, but -1 is a non-residue if p ≡3 mod4. So p ≡3 mod8: -2 is a residue? Let me check. For p=3, -2 ≡1 mod3, which is a residue. For p=5, -2=3 mod5, which is a non-residue since 3 is a quadratic non-residue mod5. Wait, maybe this approach isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity x^4 +1 = (x^2 + ax +1)(x^2 -ax +1) with a such that a^2 =2. If 2 is a square, done. If not, try a different substitution. For instance, if we can find some a such that a^2 = -2, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 + ax -1)(x^2 -ax -1). Let's check:\n\n(x^2 + ax -1)(x^2 -ax -1) = x^4 -a x^3 -x^2 +a x^3 -a^2 x^2 -a x -x^2 +a x +1 = x^4 + (-1 -a^2 -1)x^2 +1. So middle term is (-2 -a^2)x^2. For this to equal x^4 +1, we need -2 -a^2 =0, so a^2 = -2. Therefore, if -2 is a square in F_p, then this factorization works. So if p ≡1,3 mod8, then either 2 or -2 is a square, allowing such a factorization.\n\nBut how does this relate to p modulo 8? Let's recall that 2 is a quadratic residue mod p iff p ≡ ±1 mod8. So for p ≡ ±1 mod8, 2 is a square, so factor as (x^2 + sqrt(2)x +1)(x^2 - sqrt(2)x +1). For p ≡3,5 mod8, 2 is not a square, but -1 is a non-residue when p ≡3 mod4 (i.e., p ≡3,7 mod8). Wait, p ≡5 mod8 is ≡1 mod4, so -1 is a residue there. So for p ≡5 mod8, since 2 is a non-residue but -1 is a residue, maybe combine them. Let's see, if p ≡5 mod8, then 2 is a non-residue, but -2 is also a non-residue? Because (-2\/p) = (-1\/p)(2\/p). For p ≡5 mod8, (-1\/p) =1 (since 5≡1 mod4) and (2\/p) = -1, so (-2\/p)= -1. So -2 is a non-residue. Hmm. So maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that x^4 +1 splits into quadratic factors for any p. For example, in F_p, if there exists an element a such that a^2 = -1, then x^4 +1 = (x^2 +a)(x^2 -a). If not, then find a different way. Wait, but even if a^2 = -1 doesn't exist, the polynomial might still factor into quadratics with different coefficients.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that for any prime p, x^4 +1 is reducible modulo p. This can be shown by considering that in F_p[x], x^4 +1 divides x^8 -1, which splits into linear factors since the multiplicative group of F_p is cyclic of order p-1. So the roots of x^8 -1 are the 8th roots of unity. Depending on whether 8 divides p-1, the polynomial x^8 -1 will split into linear factors, so x^4 +1 factors accordingly. If 8 doesn't divide p-1, then the factors are of higher degree. Wait, but if 8 doesn't divide p-1, then the multiplicative order of elements in F_p is a divisor of p-1, so the 8th roots of unity lie in an extension field. But since x^4 +1 is a factor of x^8 -1, its splitting field is an extension of degree dividing 2. Therefore, x^4 +1 factors into quadratic factors over F_p.\n\nHence, regardless of p, x^4 +1 factors modulo p into linear or quadratic factors. Therefore, it is reducible modulo every prime p.\n\nPutting this together, the assumptions and problem are as follows:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The polynomial in question is \\( x^4 + 1 \\).\n- The polynomial is considered in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\).\n- For reducibility modulo primes, consider all prime numbers \\( p \\).\n\nProblem:\n- Prove that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\).\n- Prove that \\( x^4 + 1 \\) is reducible modulo every prime \\( p \\).",

For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p (i.e., in 𝔽_p[x])\n\n**Part 1: Irreducibility in ℤ[x]**\n\nWe use Eisenstein's criterion. First, make the substitution x = y + 1. Then:\n\nx^4 + 1 = (y + 1)^4 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2\n\nNow consider this polynomial in ℤ[y]: f(y) = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2.\n\nCheck Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = 2:\n- All coefficients except the leading coefficient are divisible by 2:\n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\n  - 6 ≡ 0 mod 2  \n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\n  - 2 ≡ 0 mod 2\n- The constant term 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 2^2 = 4\n- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2\n\nThus by Eisenstein's criterion with p = 2, f(y) is irreducible in ℤ[y]. Since the substitution x = y + 1 is an automorphism of ℤ[x] (it's invertible with inverse y = x - 1), the irreducibility of f(y) implies the irreducibility of x^4 + 1 in ℤ[x].\n\n**Part 2: Reducibility modulo every prime p**\n\nWe consider two cases: p = 2 and p odd.\n\n**Case 1: p = 2**\nIn 𝔽_2[x], we have:\nx^4 + 1 = x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)^4 in 𝔽_2[x] since (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 = x^4 + 1 in 𝔽_2 (all coefficients except first and last are even, hence 0 mod 2).\nThus x^4 + 1 is clearly reducible modulo 2.\n\n**Case 2: p odd prime**\nLet p be an odd prime. We work in the finite field 𝔽_p.\n\n**Lemma**: In any finite field 𝔽_q of odd characteristic, -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\nProof: The multiplicative group 𝔽_{q^2}^× is cyclic of order q^2 - 1. Since q is odd, q^2 - 1 = (q - 1)(q + 1) is divisible by 4 (as both q-1 and q+1 are even). Thus there exists an element α ∈ 𝔽_{q^2}^× of order 4. Then α^2 has order 2, so α^2 = -1. Hence -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\n\nNow take q = p. Since -1 is a square in 𝔽_{p^2}, there exists β ∈ 𝔽_{p^2} such that β^2 = -1.\n\nConsider the polynomial x^4 + 1. We can factor it as:\nx^4 + 1 = (x^2)^2 - (-1) = (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) in 𝔽_{p^2}[x]\n\nBut we need factors in 𝔽_p[x]. Note that β and -β are conjugates over 𝔽_p since they satisfy the same minimal polynomial x^2 + 1. More precisely, if β ∉ 𝔽_p, then its conjugate under the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p is β^p = -β (since (β^2)^p = (-1)^p = -1, and β^p = ±β, but β ∉ 𝔽_p implies β^p ≠ β, so β^p = -β).\n\nThus the product (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) has coefficients in 𝔽_p. To see this explicitly:\n(x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) = x^4 - β^2 = x^4 + 1\n\nAlternatively, we can find an explicit factorization in 𝔽_p[x]. Let a ∈ 𝔽_p be such that a^2 = -1 if -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, or find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p such that a^2 + b^2 = -1 if -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. In fact:\n\n- If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, so there exists a ∈ 𝔽_p with a^2 = -1. Then:\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + a)(x^2 - a) in 𝔽_p[x]\n\n- If p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. However, we can find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p, not both zero, such that a^2 + b^2 = -1. This is always possible in finite fields. Then:\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) in 𝔽_p[x]\n  To verify: (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2\n  We need 2b - a^2 = 0 and b^2 = 1. So we need a^2 = 2b and b^2 = 1, hence b = ±1.\n  If b = 1, we need a^2 = 2. If 2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\n  If b = -1, we need a^2 = -2. If -2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\n  For p ≡ 3 mod 4, one of 2 or -2 is always a square in 𝔽_p.\n\nA more uniform approach: In 𝔽_p, consider the polynomial x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1). The roots of x^8 - 1 are the 8th roots of unity. In characteristic p, if p ≠ 2, the 8th roots of unity exist in some extension field. Since the Galois group of the splitting field is abelian, all irreducible factors of x^4 + 1 over 𝔽_p have the same degree. This degree divides 4 and must be 1 or 2 (since if it were 4, x^4 + 1 would be irreducible over 𝔽_p, but we can show this never happens).\n\n**Complete proof for odd p**:\nLet ζ be a primitive 8th root of unity in some extension of 𝔽_p. Then ζ^4 = -1, so ζ^2 is a primitive 4th root of unity. The roots of x^4 + 1 are ζ, ζ^3, ζ^5, ζ^7.\n\nConsider the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p. The orbit of ζ under σ determines the minimal polynomial. We have:\nσ(ζ) = ζ^p\n\nSince the multiplicative order of ζ is 8, and p is odd, p mod 8 is either 1, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- If p ≡ ±1 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±1}, so the orbit has size 1 or 2, giving linear or quadratic factors.\n- If p ≡ ±3 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±3}, and ζ^{p^2} = ζ^{9} = ζ (since ζ^8 = 1), so the orbit has size 2, giving quadratic factors.\n\nThus in all cases, x^4 + 1 factors into polynomials of degree at most 2 over 𝔽_p.\n\n**Explicit factorizations**:\n- For p ≡ 1 mod 8: x^4 + 1 splits completely into linear factors.\n- For p ≡ 5 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\n- For p ≡ 3 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\n- For p ≡ 7 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\n\nIn all cases, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWe have shown:\n1. x^4 + 1 is irreducible in ℤ[x] by Eisenstein's criterion after substitution.\n2. For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible in 𝔽_p[x] (trivially for p=2, and by the above argument for odd p).\n\nThis completes the proof.",
