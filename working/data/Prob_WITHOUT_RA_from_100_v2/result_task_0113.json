    "Content":"Regarding this problem , I conjectured that $$ I(r, s) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^{2} + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^{2} - sx + 1} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4 \\pi \\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2r + 2\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}}{s^{2}} - 1}. $$ Though we may try the same technique as in the previous problem, now I'm curious if this generality leads us to a different (and possible a more elegant) proof. Indeed, I observed that $I(r, 0) = 0$ and $$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial s}(r, s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left\\{ \\frac{2\\sqrt{y}}{(r-s)y^{2} + 2(2-r)y + (r+s)}+\\frac{2\\sqrt{y}}{(r+s)y^{2}+ 2(2-r)y + (r-s)} \\right\\} \\,\\mathrm dy, $$ which can be evaluated using standard contour integration technique. But simplifying the residue and integrating them seems still daunting. EDIT. By applying a series of change of variables, I noticed that the problem is equivalent to prove that $$ \\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s) := \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{ 1 + 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}}{ 1 - 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4\\pi \\alpha $$ for $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$. (This is equivalent to the condition that the expression inside the logarithm is positive for all $x \\in \\Bbb{R}$.) Another simple observation. once you prove that $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$ does not depend on the variable $s$ for $s > 1$, then by suitable limiting process it follows that $$ \\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\log \\left( \\frac{ 1 + 2x \\sin\\alpha + x^{2}}{ 1 - 2x \\sin\\alpha + x^{2}} \\right) \\, \\frac{\\mathrm dx}{x}, $$ which (I guess) can be calculated by hand. The following graph may also help us understand the behavior of this integral.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"So, following the procedure I outlined here , I get for the transformed integral: $$I(r,s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dv \\frac{4 s \\left(v^2-1\\right) \\left(v^4-(4 r-6) v^2+1\\right)}{v^8+4 \\left(2 r-s^2-1\\right) v^6 +2 \\left(8 r^2-8 r-4 s^2+3\\right) v^4 +4 \\left(2 r-s^2-1\\right) v^2 +1} \\log{v} $$ Note that this reduces to the integral in the original problem when $r=3$ and $s=2$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem and extract the necessary information. The original question is about an integral I(r, s) defined from -1 to 1 of a complex expression involving a logarithm and a square root. The user has a conjecture for the value of this integral in terms of arccotangent and square roots. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The integral is defined with specific bounds (-1 to 1), the integrand has a 1\/x term, a square root of (1+x)\/(1-x), and a logarithm of a rational function. The parameters r and s are involved in the numerator and denominator of the log's argument. The problem mentions that the expression inside the logarithm must be positive for all x in ℝ, which relates to the conditions on r and s. Also, the user provides an equivalent form with variables α and s, where they state that -π\/2 < α < π\/2 and s > 1. Additionally, there's a note that after variable changes, the integral is supposed to equal 4πα. \n\nSo, the assumptions should include the domain of integration, the structure of the integrand, conditions on r and s (or α and s), and perhaps the equivalence between different forms. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object. Let me break it down:\n\n1. The integral is over the interval [-1, 1].\n2. The integrand is (1\/x) * sqrt[(1+x)\/(1-x)] * log[( (r-1)x² + sx +1 ) \/ ( (r-1)x² - sx +1 )].\n3. The parameters r and s satisfy conditions such that the argument of the logarithm is positive for all x ∈ ℝ.\n4. For the equivalent integral Ỹ(α, s), -π\/2 < α < π\/2 and s > 1.\n5. The expression inside the logarithm in Ỹ(α, s) is positive for all x ∈ ℝ.\n\nThe problem is to prove that I(r, s) equals the given expression involving arccotangent. Alternatively, after the equivalent transformation, proving Ỹ(α, s) = 4πα. However, the user mentions that proving Ỹ does not depend on s would allow simplifying to another integral which can be computed. But the main problem statement seems to be the original conjecture. I need to check the user's exact problem statement.\n\nThe original problem in the question starts with \"I conjectured that...\" followed by the integral expression equals 4π arccot(...). Then they mention trying techniques from a previous problem and wanting a more elegant proof. The problem as posed is to prove that conjecture. The equivalent form with α and s is a step they took, but the main problem is still the original integral I(r, s) equals the given expression. However, in the edit, they rephrase the problem in terms of Ỹ(α, s) = 4πα. The user is asking for help in proving either of these, but the main problem is the original conjecture.\n\nBut to structure the problem as per the example, perhaps focus on the original integral I(r, s) and list the assumptions. However, the user's own rephrasing introduces the equivalent problem with Ỹ(α, s). The problem statement might need to capture both, but the example given in the instruction lists assumptions and the problem. The user also mentions conditions on s and r (or α and s). So, the assumptions would be the domain of integration, the integrand's form, the conditions on parameters ensuring the log's argument is positive, and possibly the equivalence to Ỹ(α, s). But since the problem is to prove the equality, the main assumptions are about the parameters and the integrand's structure.\n\nTherefore, structuring as:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The integral is computed over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log\\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^{2} + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^{2} - sx + 1} \\right)$.\n- The parameters $r$ and $s$ are such that the argument of the logarithm is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- For the equivalent integral $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$.\n- The expression inside the logarithm in $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$ is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\nI(r, s) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^{2} + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^{2} - sx + 1} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4 \\pi \\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2r + 2\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}}{s^{2}} - 1}.\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if focusing on the equivalent form:\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\n\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{ 1 + 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}}{ 1 - 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4\\pi \\alpha\n$$\nfor $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$.\n\nBut the original problem is the first integral I(r, s). The user's own rephrasing is part of their approach. So the main problem is the original conjecture. However, in the EDIT, they mention the equivalent problem. The user is asking for help proving either, but the problem as posed is the first equation. The example given in the instruction had the problem restated, so perhaps we need to include the main problem and the equivalent form as part of the assumptions.\n\nWait, the example in the instruction includes the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it was for every integer n. So the example added an assumption that wasn't there, probably as part of the problem's actual hidden condition. Hmm, maybe in that example, the user had an error, but the assistant followed the instruction.\n\nWait, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems contradictory. Maybe the example was incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which doesn't require n to be divisible by 7. So that example might have a mistake. However, the instruction says to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. So maybe the assistant in the example made a mistake by adding \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original problem. Therefore, perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's original conjecture is the integral equals 4π arccot(...). The equivalent problem with α is their own step, but the main problem is the first integral. The assumptions would include the integral's structure and the conditions on r and s. The user also mentions that the expression inside the logarithm is positive for all x, which is an important condition.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral is evaluated over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n- The integrand is $\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log\\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^2 + s x + 1}{(r-1)x^2 - s x + 1} \\right)$.\n- The parameters $r$ and $s$ are such that the argument of the logarithm is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The expression inside the logarithm in the equivalent integral $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$ is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- For $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\nI(r, s) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^{2} + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^{2} - sx + 1} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4 \\pi \\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2r + 2\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}}{s^{2}} - 1}.\n$$\n\nAlternatively, if the user's main problem after edit is to show the equivalent integral equals 4πα, then:\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\n\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log \\left( \\frac{ 1 + 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}}{ 1 - 2sx \\sin\\alpha + (s^{2} - \\cos^{2}\\alpha) x^{2}} \\right) \\, \\mathrm dx = 4\\pi \\alpha\n$$\nfor $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$.\n\nBut the user's original problem is the first integral, and the second is a transformed version they're considering. Since the example in the instruction includes the problem statement as the original conjecture, perhaps the problem here should be the first integral. However, the user mentions in their edit that the problem is equivalent to proving the second integral equals 4πα. So maybe the main problem is either, but the user is asking for a proof of the conjecture, which is the original statement.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to present both as separate problems but given the format requires one problem, maybe focus on the original one. However, the user's final note says that if they can prove independence of s, then compute the integral. But the main problem is the conjecture. Given the complexity, perhaps stick to the original problem.\n\nAlternatively, in the example, even though the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems incorrect. Maybe the example is faulty. Therefore, in this case, to avoid similar mistake, need to be precise.\n\nThe original problem is to prove I(r, s) equals the given expression. The user's equivalent formulation is part of their approach. So the main problem is the original integral.\n\nThe assumptions would be:\n\n- The integral is over x from -1 to 1.\n- The integrand is (1\/x)sqrt[(1+x)\/(1-x)] times the log ratio.\n- The parameters r and s are such that the expression inside the log is positive for all x ∈ ℝ.\n- The equivalent integral Ỹ(α, s) is defined with specific substitutions leading to the equation involving α.\n- For Ỹ(α, s), α is between -π\/2 and π\/2, and s > 1.\n\nBut the problem is to prove I(r, s) = 4π arccot(...). Therefore, the key assumptions are about the integral's structure and the conditions on r and s. The equivalent form is part of the user's approach, not the problem's assumption.\n\nThus, structuring as:\n\nAssumption:\n- The integral $I(r, s)$ is evaluated over $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n- The integrand of $I(r, s)$ is $\\frac{1}{x}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+x}{1-x}} \\log\\left( \\frac{(r-1)x^2 + s x + 1}{(r-1)x^2 - s x + 1} \\right)$.\n- The parameters $r$ and $s$ are such that the argument of the logarithm is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The equivalent integral $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$ is defined with $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $s > 1$.\n- The expression inside the logarithm in $\\tilde{I}(\\alpha, s)$ is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nProblem: Prove that \n$$\nI(r, s) = 4 \\pi \\operatorname{arccot} \\sqrt{ \\frac{2r + 2\\sqrt{r^{2} - s^{2}}}{s^{2}} - 1}.\n$$\n\nBut maybe the equivalent integral is a separate problem. However, according to the user's question, the main problem is the first integral. The rest is their approach. The example in the instruction included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem, but here, the assumptions are part of the problem's conditions. For example, the original problem requires that the expression inside the log is positive, which is an implicit assumption. So including that as an assumption is correct.\n\nSo the final answer would list the integral's structure, the domain, and the conditions on r and s. The equivalent form with α and s is part of the user's approach but is an additional assumption if we consider it part of the problem's conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentions that proving the integral equals 4πα is equivalent, perhaps the problem can be stated in terms of Ỹ(α, s) = 4πα, given the conditions on α and s. However, the original conjecture is about I(r, s). Given the user's instruction example, which restructured the problem to include an assumption not present in the original problem, perhaps here the key is to extract all the necessary conditions and structure the problem clearly.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should include assumptions about the integral's interval, integrand form, and conditions on parameters ensuring the log's argument is positive. The problem is to prove the integral equals the given expression.",

When (r-1) < 0, both open downward and are negative everywhere, making their ratio positive.\nStep 8) The conditions reduce to: s² < 4(r-1) if r > 1, or s² < 4(r-1) if r < 1 (but note r-1 negative in second case).",

Therefore, for both $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ to maintain constant sign, we require:\n\\[\\Delta = s^2 - 4(r-1) < 0\\]\nThis condition also ensures $D(x) \\neq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Sign analysis based on leading coefficient**\nThe sign of the quadratic polynomials is determined by their leading coefficient $(r-1)$ when $\\Delta < 0$:\n\n1. **Case $r > 1$**: Then $(r-1) > 0$, so both $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ open upward. With $\\Delta < 0$, both are positive definite: $N(x) > 0$ and $D(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus $\\frac{N(x)}{D(x)} > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2. **Case $r < 1$**: Then $(r-1) < 0$, so both $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ open downward. With $\\Delta < 0$, both are negative definite: $N(x) < 0$ and $D(x) < 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus $\\frac{N(x)}{D(x)} > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (negative divided by negative is positive).\n\n3. **Case $r = 1$**: Then $(r-1) = 0$, so $N(x) = sx + 1$ and $D(x) = -sx + 1$ are linear functions. For $s > 1$ (from Assumption 3), these linear functions will have opposite signs for some $x$ (specifically when $x < -1\/s$ or $x > 1\/s$). Therefore $r = 1$ does not satisfy the condition that $\\frac{N(x)}{D(x)} > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 5: Summary of conditions**\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for $\\frac{(r-1)x^2 + sx + 1}{(r-1)x^2 - sx + 1} > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $s^2 < 4(r-1)$ (ensuring $\\Delta < 0$)\n\\item $r \\neq 1$ (to avoid the linear case)\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n**Step 6: Verification**\nWhen $s^2 < 4(r-1)$ and $r \\neq 1$:\n- If $r > 1$, then $s^2 < 4(r-1) > 0$, so $\\Delta < 0$ and both quadratics are positive definite.\n- If $r < 1$, then $4(r-1) < 0$, so $s^2 < 4(r-1)$ implies $s^2 < \\text{negative number}$, which forces $\\Delta < 0$ and both quadratics are negative definite.\n\nIn both valid cases, $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ have the same sign for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, making their ratio positive.
