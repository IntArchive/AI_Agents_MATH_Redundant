    "Content":"Problem : Given $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ show $a + b + c$ is always even My Attempt , Case by case analysis : Case 1: a is odd, b is odd. From the first equation, $odd^2 + odd^2 = c^2$ $odd + odd = c^2 \\implies c^2 = even$ Squaring a number does not change its congruence mod 2. Therefore c is even $ a + b + c = odd + odd + even = even$ Case 2: a is even, b is even. Similar to above $even^2 + even^2 = c^2 \\implies c$ is even $a + b + c = even + even + even = even$ Case 3:\nOne of a and b is odd, the other is even\nWithout loss of generality, we label a as odd, and b as even $odd^2 + even^2 = c^2 \\implies odd + even = c^2 = odd$ Therefore c is odd $a + b + c = odd + even + odd = even$ We have exhausted every possible case, and each shows $a + b + c$ is even. QED Follow Up :\nIs there a proof that doesn't rely on case by case analysis?\nCan the above be written in a simpler way?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the sum of a Pythagorean triple a + b + c is always even. They provided a case-by-case analysis, but they're asking if there's a proof without that and if it can be simplified.\n\nFirst, I need to structure the original problem according to the given format. The original question mentions a Pythagorean triple where a² + b² = c², and the goal is to prove a + b + c is always even. The user considered three cases: both a and b odd, both even, and one odd one even. Each case led to the conclusion that the sum is even.\n\nSo, for the assumptions, I need to list each condition. The main assumption here is that a, b, c are integers satisfying a² + b² = c². Since it's a Pythagorean triple, they are positive integers, but the problem doesn't specify positivity, but usually triples are considered positive. However, maybe that's an implicit assumption. The problem also wants to show the sum is even, which relates to parity. The assumptions should capture the necessary conditions without extra info.\n\nWait, the problem as stated in the title and question is \"Given a² + b² = c², show a + b + c is always even.\" So the key assumptions are that a, b, c are integers (since Pythagorean triples are integers) and that they satisfy the equation. The user didn't mention any divisibility conditions beyond that. So the assumptions are:\n\n- a, b, c are integers\n- a² + b² = c²\n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the assumption included specific conditions like n being an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem doesn't specify any such conditions on a, b, c except that they form a Pythagorean triple. So in the formatted problem, the assumptions would just be that a, b, c are integers satisfying a² + b² = c². Wait, but in the user's original problem, they might have considered that in a Pythagorean triple, exactly one of a, b is even, but that's actually part of known properties. However, the problem as stated doesn't make any assumptions beyond the equation. So the assumptions should just be:\n\nAssumption:\na, b, c are integers,\na² + b² = c².\n\nProblem:\nProve that a + b + c is always even.\n\nBut the user's own solution considered cases based on parity. Maybe there's a way to avoid case analysis by using modular arithmetic. Let me think. For any integer, squares modulo 2 are either 0 or 1. So if a² + b² ≡ c² mod 2. Let's see: if a is even, a² ≡ 0 mod 2; if odd, 1. Similarly for b. So possible combinations:\n\nIf a and b are both even: a² + b² ≡ 0 + 0 = 0 mod 2 ⇒ c² ≡ 0 ⇒ c even.\n\nIf one even, one odd: a² + b² ≡ 1 + 0 = 1 mod 2 ⇒ c² ≡1 ⇒ c odd.\n\nIf both odd: a² + b² ≡1 +1 = 2 ≡0 mod2 ⇒ c even.\n\nSo in each case, the parity of c is determined. Then, the sum a + b + c:\n\nCase 1: both a and b even ⇒ c even ⇒ sum even + even + even = even.\n\nCase 2: one even, one odd ⇒ c odd ⇒ sum even + odd + odd = even.\n\nCase 3: both odd ⇒ c even ⇒ sum odd + odd + even = even.\n\nSo in all cases, the sum is even. But this is still case analysis. However, maybe we can use modulo 2 arithmetic for the sum directly.\n\nLet’s consider modulo 2:\n\na + b + c ≡ a + b + c (mod 2).\n\nBut from a² + b² = c², we have:\n\na² ≡ c² - b² ≡ (c - b)(c + b) mod 2.\n\nWait, but maybe better to note that squares modulo 2 are either 0 or 1. So:\n\nIf a is even: a ≡0 ⇒ a²≡0.\n\nIf a is odd: a ≡1 ⇒a²≡1.\n\nSame for b and c.\n\nThus, the equation a² + b² ≡ c² mod 2 implies:\n\nPossible cases:\n\n0 + 0 ≡0: c²≡0 ⇒ c even.\n\n0 +1 ≡1: c²≡1 ⇒c odd.\n\n1 +1 ≡0: c²≡0 ⇒c even.\n\nSo, in terms of parity:\n\nIf a and b have the same parity (both even or both odd), then c is even.\n\nIf a and b have different parity (one even, one odd), then c is odd.\n\nNow, the sum a + b + c mod 2:\n\nIf a and b same parity:\n\nIf both even: 0 +0 +0 =0.\n\nIf both odd:1 +1 +0=2≡0.\n\nIf different parity: say a even, b odd: 0 +1 +1=2≡0.\n\nSimilarly, a odd, b even: same.\n\nSo in all cases, the sum is 0 mod2 ⇒ even.\n\nThus, we can argue without case analysis by considering that:\n\nFrom the equation, a² + b² ≡ c² mod2.\n\nBut squares modulo2 are 0 or1. The possible sums are 0,1, or2 (≡0).\n\nThus, either c is even (sum 0 or2) or odd (sum1). Then, the sum a + b + c:\n\nIf c is even, then a and b must be both even or both odd. Both even: sum even. Both odd: sum odd + odd + even = even.\n\nIf c is odd, then one of a or b is even, the other odd. Sum even + odd + odd = even.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of modulo2:\n\na + b + c ≡a + b + c mod2.\n\nBut since a² + b² ≡c² mod2, and squares are a² ≡a mod2 (since 0²=0,1²=1), so:\n\na + b ≡ c mod2.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c ≡ (c) + c ≡2c ≡0 mod2.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because if we know that a² + b² ≡ c² mod2, but since squares mod2 are equal to the original numbers mod2, because 0²=0 and1²=1. Therefore:\n\na² ≡a mod2,\n\nb² ≡b mod2,\n\nc² ≡c mod2.\n\nTherefore, the equation a² + b² ≡c² mod2 becomes:\n\na + b ≡c mod2.\n\nTherefore, a + b ≡c mod2 ⇒ a + b + c ≡ c + c ≡2c ≡0 mod2.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c is even.\n\nThus, this is a more concise proof without case analysis. So the key step is recognizing that squares modulo2 are the same as the original numbers, leading to a + b ≡c mod2, hence the sum is 0 mod2.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have assumptions that a, b, c are integers and satisfy a² + b² = c². The problem is to prove the sum is even. The user's follow-up asks for a non-case analysis proof, which can be done via this modular approach.",
