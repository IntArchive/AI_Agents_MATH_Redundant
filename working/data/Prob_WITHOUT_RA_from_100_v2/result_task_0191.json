    "Content":"Assume that there exists a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is bijective and satisfies\n$$\nf(x) + f^{-1}(x)=x\n$$\nfor all $x$. Here $f^{-1}$ is the inverse function. Show that $f$ is odd. This was a brain-teaser given to me by a friend. Two other related questions are: Show that $f$ is discontinuous Give an example of such a function (if indeed one exists). Edit: As an initial idea, maybe approaching the problem graphically would help? A function and its inverse are reflections of each other about $y=x$ on the $x$-$y$ plane. Does this lead to anywhere?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here is finally a constructive example of a solution, continuous except on a countable set.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the required format. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proving that a function is odd.\" The problem states that there's a bijective function f from R to R satisfying f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x for all x. They need to show f is odd. There are also other parts mentioned, like showing f is discontinuous and giving an example, but the main task here is just the first part about the function being odd.\n\nNow, following the example provided, the Assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem mentions that f is a function from R to R, it's bijective, and satisfies the equation f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x for all x. Each of these should be separate assumptions.\n\nWait, the original example included an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Each as separate lines. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- f: R → R is a function.\n- f is bijective.\n- For all x, f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x.\n\nThen the problem is to show that f is odd, meaning f(-x) = -f(x) for all x.\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example had an assumption about n being an integer and another about n being divisible by 7. Here, the assumptions are about the function f. Each property (being a function from R to R, bijective, satisfying the equation) should be separate. So I need to split them into individual points.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The problem doesn't mention continuity or differentiability, so those aren't part of the assumptions. The user also mentioned to filter out unrelated information. The question mentions other parts (show discontinuous, give example) but those are additional questions, not part of the current problem. So the formatted problem should only address showing f is odd under the given assumptions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function with domain and codomain ℝ,\nf is bijective,\nFor all real numbers x, f(x) + f⁻¹(x) = x.\n\nProblem:\nShow that f is odd.\n\nI need to check if each assumption is one condition per line. The first line is about the function's domain and codomain. The second is bijectivity. The third is the functional equation. Each is a separate condition, so that's correct. The problem statement is to show f is odd. That seems to fit the required format.",

We need to prove such g exists and is unique.\nStep 2) Show f is injective: Assume f(a) = f(b). From the given equation, f(a) + g(a) = a and f(b) + g(b) = b. Since f(a) = f(b), we have g(a) = a - f(a) and g(b) = b - f(b). If f(a) = f(b), then g(a) = a - f(a) and g(b) = b - f(a). Apply f to both sides: f(g(a)) = a and f(g(b)) = b. Since f is a function, if g(a) = g(b), then a = b. Need to show g(a) = g(b) when f(a) = f(b).\nStep 3) Show f is surjective: For any y∈ℝ, we need to find x∈ℝ such that f(x) = y. Consider x = y + g(y). Then f(x) = f(y + g(y)). Need to show this equals y using the given equation.\nStep 4) Since f is bijective, the inverse function f^{-1} exists properly and satisfies f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x for all x∈ℝ.\nStep 5) Verify that the given equation f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x holds with the properly defined inverse, completing the proof.",

Then by definition, $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Prove $f$ is injective.**\nAssume $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We need to show $a = b$.\n\nFrom the given equation: $f(a) + g(a) = a$ and $f(b) + g(b) = b$.\nSince $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:\n$g(a) = a - f(a)$ and $g(b) = b - f(b) = b - f(a)$.\n\nNow apply $f$ to both $g(a)$ and $g(b)$:\n$f(g(a)) = a$ (by definition of $g$)\n$f(g(b)) = b$ (by definition of $g$)\n\nIf we can show $g(a) = g(b)$, then $f(g(a)) = f(g(b))$ implies $a = b$.\n\nFrom $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:\n$g(a) = a - f(a)$ and $g(b) = b - f(a)$.\nWe need to show $a - f(a) = b - f(a)$, which would imply $a = b$.\n\nConsider applying $f$ to $g(a)$ and $g(b)$ differently. Since $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$, if $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the given equation more directly. Since $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:\n$a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.\nThus $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.\n\nNow consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. If $g(a) \\neq g(b)$, then $f$ would map two different inputs to different outputs, which doesn't contradict injectivity. We need a different approach.\n\nLet's use the fact that $g$ is defined by $f(g(x)) = x$. Since $f(a) = f(b)$, let $y = f(a) = f(b)$. Then:\n$f(a) = y \\Rightarrow a = f(a) + g(a) = y + g(a)$\n$f(b) = y \\Rightarrow b = f(b) + g(b) = y + g(b)$\n\nNow apply $f$ to $g(a)$ and $g(b)$:\n$f(g(a)) = a = y + g(a)$\n$f(g(b)) = b = y + g(b)$\n\nBut also, by definition of $g$, we have $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. This is consistent.\n\nConsider the composition: $f(g(f(a))) = f(a) = y$. But also $f(g(f(a))) = f(a) + g(f(a))$ by applying the given equation to $f(a)$ instead of $a$.\nWait, the given equation is $f(x) + g(x) = x$ for all $x$. So for $x = f(a)$, we have:\n$f(f(a)) + g(f(a)) = f(a) = y$.\n\nThis doesn't directly help. Let's try a cleaner approach:\n\nAssume $f(a) = f(b)$. We want to show $a = b$.\nFrom the given: $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.\nSo $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.\n\nNow consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$.\nIf $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$ and we're done.\nIf $g(a) \\neq g(b)$, then $f$ maps $g(a)$ to $a$ and $g(b)$ to $b$.\nBut we also have $f(a) = f(b)$. So $f$ maps $a$ and $b$ to the same value $y$.\n\nConsider applying $g$ to $y$: $g(y) = y - f(y)$ by the given equation.\nBut $f(g(y)) = y$ by definition.\n\nActually, let's prove injectivity by contradiction. Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ but $a \\neq b$.\nThen $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(a) + g(b)$, so $a - b = g(a) - g(b) \\neq 0$.\nThus $g(a) \\neq g(b)$.\n\nNow $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. Since $a \\neq b$, we have $f(g(a)) \\neq f(g(b))$.\nBut $g(a) \\neq g(b)$, so this doesn't give a contradiction.\n\nWait, we need to use the fact that $g$ itself satisfies a similar property. From $f(g(x)) = x$, we can apply the given equation to $g(x)$:\n$f(g(x)) + g(g(x)) = g(x)$ for all $x$.\nBut $f(g(x)) = x$, so $x + g(g(x)) = g(x)$, or $g(g(x)) = g(x) - x$.\n\nThis might help. Let's continue with surjectivity first and see if that helps with injectivity.\n\n**Step 2: Prove $f$ is surjective.**\nFor any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we need to find $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n\nConsider $x = y + g(y)$. Then:\n$f(x) = f(y + g(y))$.\nWe need to show this equals $y$.\n\nFrom the given equation applied to $y$: $f(y) + g(y) = y$, so $g(y) = y - f(y)$.\nThus $x = y + (y - f(y)) = 2y - f(y)$.\n\nThis doesn't seem to directly give $f(x) = y$. Let's try a different approach.\n\nTake $x = g(y)$. Then $f(x) = f(g(y)) = y$ by definition of $g$.\nSo for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $x = g(y)$ satisfies $f(x) = y$.\nThus $f$ is surjective!\n\n**Step 3: Now prove $f$ is injective using surjectivity.**\nWe know $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(a) = f(b)$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exist $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $a = g(u)$ and $b = g(v)$.\nThen $f(g(u)) = u$ and $f(g(v)) = v$.\nBut $f(g(u)) = f(a) = f(b) = f(g(v))$, so $u = v$.\nThus $a = g(u) = g(v) = b$.\nTherefore $f$ is injective.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, $f$ is bijective.\n\n**Step 5: Verification.**\nNow that we've proven $f$ is bijective, the inverse function $f^{-1}$ exists properly and satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The given equation $f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x$ holds with this properly defined inverse, completing the proof.\n\nThus, under the given assumptions, $f$ is bijective.",
