Since $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} > 0$, we have $\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\geq 0$, so $N \\\\geq 1$, making $N$ a natural number.\\n2. By definition of the floor function, $\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right\\\\rfloor \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} < \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 = N$.\\nTherefore, $N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify the condition for $n > N$**\\nTake any $n > N$. Since $N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$, we have:\\n$n > N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$\\nThus $n > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$.\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclude the inequality**\\nFrom $n > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$, we can reverse the steps from Step 3:\\n$n > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\implies \\\\frac{1}{n} < \\\\epsilon \\\\implies \\\\left|\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right| < \\\\epsilon \\\\implies \\\\left|\\\\frac{1}{n} - 0\\\\right| < \\\\epsilon$\\n\\n**Step 7: Complete the proof**\\nWe have shown that for any arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose $N = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1$ such that for all $n > N$, we have $\\\\left|\\\\frac{1}{n} - 0\\\\right| < \\\\epsilon$. By the $\\epsilon$-$N$ definition of limit, this proves that:\\n$\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n} = 0$\\n\\n**Alternative choice of $N$**: Note that we could also choose $N = \\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\right\\\\rceil$ (the ceiling of $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$), or simply any natural number $N$ satisfying $N > \\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon}$. The existence of such $N$ is guaranteed by the Archimedean property of real numbers, which states that for any real number $x$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $n > x$.\"\n}",
