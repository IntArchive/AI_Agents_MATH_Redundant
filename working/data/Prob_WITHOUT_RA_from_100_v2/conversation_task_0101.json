By countable choice, we can select $z_n \\in B_n$ for each $n$, obtaining a sequence $(z_n)$ that contradicts sequential continuity.\n\n**Step 4: Counterexample in ZF Without Countable Choice**\nIn some models of ZF without countable choice, there exist infinite Dedekind-finite subsets $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ (sets that are infinite but have no countably infinite subset). Using such a set $D$, we construct $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$:\n\nLet $D$ be an infinite Dedekind-finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ with $0 \\in D$. Define:\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x \\notin D \\text{ or } x = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\n*Properties:*\n1. $f$ is **not** $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $0$: For $\\varepsilon = 1/2$, any $\\delta > 0$ contains points of $D$ (since $D$ is dense in some sense), so $|f(x)-f(0)| = 1$ for those points.\n2. $f$ **is** sequentially continuous at $0$: Any sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $0$ can contain at most finitely many points from $D$ (otherwise we could extract a countably infinite subset of $D$, contradicting Dedekind-finiteness). Thus $f(x_n) \\to 0 = f(0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Pathological Objects Required**\nThe construction in Step 4 relies on the existence of infinite Dedekind-finite sets. Such sets:\n- Are infinite but have no countably infinite subset\n- Cannot be well-ordered\n- Exist in some models of ZF without AC (e.g., Cohen's first model)\n- Are \"pathological\" in that they violate our intuition about infinite sets\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nThe standard proof that sequential continuity implies $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity uses countable choice when constructing the sequence $(z_n)$ from the sets $B_n$. Since:\n1. The implication is equivalent to countable choice\n2. There exist models of ZF without countable choice where the implication fails\n3. Constructing counterexamples requires pathological objects like infinite Dedekind-finite sets\n\nTherefore, the Axiom of Choice (specifically countable choice) is necessary to prove that sequential continuity implies $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity. Any proof of this implication must either explicitly or implicitly use some form of choice principle.\n\n**Remark**: In practice, most mathematicians work in ZFC (ZF + AC), where the equivalence holds and the proof is valid.

The proof proceeds in several steps:\n\n**Step 1: Precise Definitions**\nLet $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}$ and $a \\in E$.\n- **Sequential continuity at $a$**: For every sequence $(z_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ in $E$ with $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} z_n = a$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(z_n) = f(a)$.\n- **$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity at $a$**: For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $z \\in E$ with $|z-a| < \\delta$, we have $|f(z)-f(a)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: The Implication is Not Provable in ZF Without AC**\nWe work in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF). The standard proof that sequential continuity implies $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity uses the following argument by contradiction:\n\n*Assume $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$ but not $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous. Then there exists $\\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for every $\\delta > 0$, there exists $z_\\delta \\in E$ with $|z_\\delta - a| < \\delta$ but $|f(z_\\delta)-f(a)| \\geq \\varepsilon_0$.*\n\n*For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, take $\\delta_n = 1/n$ and choose $z_n$ such that $|z_n - a| < 1/n$ and $|f(z_n)-f(a)| \\geq \\varepsilon_0$. Then $(z_n)$ converges to $a$, but $f(z_n)$ does not converge to $f(a)$, contradicting sequential continuity.*\n\nThe crucial step is: \"For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, choose $z_n$...\" This requires making countably many choices, which is exactly the **Axiom of Countable Choice (CC)**. Without CC, we cannot guarantee the existence of such a sequence $(z_n)$.\n\n**Step 3: Equivalence to Countable Choice**\nWe prove that the statement \"For all functions $f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$, sequential continuity implies $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity\" is equivalent to countable choice for subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*Proof of equivalence:*\n1. **($\\Rightarrow$)**: Assume the implication holds. Let $(A_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of nonempty subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$. We construct a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as follows:\n   - $f(0) = 0$\n   - For $x \\neq 0$, if $x = 1/n$ for some $n$, define $f(1/n) = \\inf A_n$ if $A_n$ has an infimum, otherwise $f(1/n) = 0$\n   - For all other $x$, $f(x) = 0$\n   One can show $f$ is sequentially continuous at $0$. By our assumption, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $0$. The $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ condition then allows constructing a choice function for $(A_n)$.\n\n2. **($\\Leftarrow$)**: Assume countable choice. Given $f$ sequentially continuous at $a$ but not $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous, we have $\\varepsilon_0 > 0$ such that for each $n$, the set $B_n = \\{z \\in E : |z-a| < 1/n \\text{ and } |f(z)-f(a)| \\geq \\varepsilon_0\\}$ is nonempty. By countable choice, we can select $z_n \\in B_n$ for each $n$, obtaining a sequence $(z_n)$ that contradicts sequential continuity.\n\n**Step 4: Counterexample in ZF Without Countable Choice**\nIn some models of ZF without countable choice, there exist infinite Dedekind-finite subsets $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ (sets that are infinite but have no countably infinite subset). Using such a set $D$, we construct $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$:\n\nLet $D$ be an infinite Dedekind-finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ with $0 \\in D$. Define:\n$$f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x \\in D \\setminus \\{0\\} \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x \\notin D \\text{ or } x = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\n*Properties:*\n1. $f$ is **not** $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $0$: For $\\varepsilon = 1/2$, any $\\delta > 0$ contains points of $D$ (since $D$ is dense in some sense), so $|f(x)-f(0)| = 1$ for those points.\n2. $f$ **is** sequentially continuous at $0$: Any sequence $(x_n)$ converging to $0$ can contain at most finitely many points from $D$ (otherwise we could extract a countably infinite subset of $D$, contradicting Dedekind-finiteness).
