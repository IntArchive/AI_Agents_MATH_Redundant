Therefore $R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K$.\\n\\n**Step 5: Show $\\\\mathcal{O}_K \\\\subseteq R$ (all integral elements of $K$ are in $R$)**\\nLet $\\\\beta = x + y\\\\sqrt{-19} \\\\in K$ be integral over $\\\\mathbb{Z}$, where $x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\\\beta$ is integral, its trace and norm are integers:\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\operatorname{Tr}(\\\\beta) &= 2x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\operatorname{N}(\\\\beta) &= x^2 + 19y^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nFrom $2x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, let $2x = m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, so $x = m/2$.\\n\\nFrom $x^2 + 19y^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, substitute $x = m/2$:\\n$$\\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 19y^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$$\\nMultiply by 4:\\n$$m^2 + 76y^2 \\\\in 4\\\\mathbb{Z}$$\\nThus $76y^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$ (since $m^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$), so $76y^2 = n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$.\\n\\nLet $y = p/q$ in lowest terms with $p, q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, $q > 0$, $\\\\gcd(p,q) = 1$.

Since $\\\\gcd(p,q) = 1$, we have $\\\\gcd(p^2, q^2) = 1$, so $q^2 \\\\mid 76 = 2^2 \\\\cdot 19$.\\nThus $q \\\\mid 2\\\\sqrt{19}$, but since $q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, $q$ must divide $2$ (as $\\\\sqrt{19}$ is irrational). So $q = 1$ or $q = 2$.\\n\\n**Case 1: $q = 1$**\\nThen $y = p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. From $x^2 + 19y^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$ and $x = m/2$, we have:\\n$$\\\\frac{m^2}{4} + 19p^2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$$\\nThus $m^2/4 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, so $4 \\\\mid m^2$, hence $2 \\\\mid m$.

Since $19 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, we have $m^2 + 19p^2 \\\\equiv m^2 + 3p^2 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nChecking squares mod 4: $0^2 \\\\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\\\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\\\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\\\equiv 1$. So $m^2, p^2 \\\\in \\\\{0,1\\\\} \\\\pmod{4}$.\\nFor $m^2 + 3p^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, we need:\\n- If $p^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$\\n- If $p^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 + 3 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $m^2 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$\\n\\nIn either case, $m^2 \\\\equiv p^2 \\\\pmod{4}$, so $m \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{2}$.\\n\\nNow write $\\\\beta = x + y\\\\sqrt{-19} = \\\\frac{m}{2} + \\\\frac{p}{2}\\\\sqrt{-19} = \\\\frac{m-p}{2} + p\\\\left(\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\\\right)$.\\nSince $m \\\\equiv p \\\\pmod{2}$, $(m-p)/2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$, so $\\\\beta \\\\in R$.\\n\\nIn both cases, $\\\\beta \\\\in R$. Therefore $\\\\mathcal{O}_K \\\\subseteq R$.\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\\nWe have shown $R \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K$ and $\\\\mathcal{O}_K \\\\subseteq R$, so $R = \\\\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\\\\mathcal{O}_K$ is by definition the ring of integers of $K = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-19})$, and $K$ is a finite extension of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ (degree 2), we conclude that $R = \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\\\right]$ is indeed the ring of integers of a finite extension of $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n∎\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

Since $19 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we have $m^2 + 19p^2 \\equiv m^2 + 3p^2 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nChecking squares mod 4: $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\equiv 1$. So $m^2, p^2 \\in \\{0,1\\} \\pmod{4}$.\nFor $m^2 + 3p^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, we need:\n- If $p^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n- If $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 + 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\nIn either case, $m^2 \\equiv p^2 \\pmod{4}$, so $m \\equiv p \\pmod{2}$.\n\nNow write $\\beta = x + y\\sqrt{-19} = \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{p}{2}\\sqrt{-19} = \\frac{m-p}{2} + p\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $m \\equiv p \\pmod{2}$, $(m-p)/2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $\\beta \\in R$.\n\nIn both cases, $\\beta \\in R$. Therefore $\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq R$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have shown $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq R$, so $R = \\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is by definition the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$, and $K$ is a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (degree 2), we conclude that $R = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right]$ is indeed the ring of integers of a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n∎",
