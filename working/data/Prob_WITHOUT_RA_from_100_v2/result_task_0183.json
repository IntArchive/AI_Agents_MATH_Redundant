    "Content":"We know that the sine function takes it values between $[-1,1]$. So is the set $$A = \\{ \\sin{n} \\ : \\ n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$$ dense in $[-1,1]$. Generally, for showing the set is dense, one proceeds, by finding out what is $\\overline{A}$ of this given set. And if $\\overline{A} = [-1,1]$, we are through with the proof, but i having trouble here! Similarly can one do this with cosine function also, that is proving $B= \\{ \\cos{n} \\ : \\ n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ being dense in $[-1,1]$",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"The hard part is to show that for any $x$ such that $0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi$, and any $\\epsilon>0$ there exists a real number $y$ and two integers $m$ and $n$ such that $|y-x|<\\epsilon$ and $n=2\\pi m+y$.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking whether the set A = {sin(n) | n ∈ ℕ} is dense in the interval [-1, 1]. Similarly, they want to know if the set B = {cos(n) | n ∈ ℕ} is also dense in [-1, 1]. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a set to be dense in an interval. A set A is dense in [-1, 1] if every point in [-1, 1] is either in A or is a limit point of A. In other words, for any y in [-1, 1] and any ε > 0, there exists some n ∈ ℕ such that |sin(n) - y| < ε. Similarly for the cosine case.\n\nI remember that the sine and cosine functions are periodic, but here the argument n is a natural number, so we're looking at the values of sin(n) and cos(n) where n is just increasing by 1 each time. This is different from the usual continuous case where angles can take any real value. Since n is discrete, we can't just take any angle, but only those that are integers. However, the key here might be related to the distribution of these integer multiples around the unit circle.\n\nI recall something about the density of sequences like sin(n) in [-1, 1]. There's a theorem or result that says if θ is an irrational multiple of π, then the sequence sin(nθ) is dense in [-1, 1]. But in this case, θ is 1 radian, right? Because we're looking at sin(n) where each term increases the angle by 1 radian. So the question boils down to whether 1 radian is an irrational multiple of π. Wait, π is irrational, but 1 radian is just 1. Is 1\/(2π) rational? No, because π is irrational, so 1 is a rational multiple of π only if 1 = kπ for some rational k, which isn't the case. Therefore, 1 radian is an irrational multiple of π. Therefore, by that theorem, the sequence sin(n) should be dense in [-1, 1].\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The theorem I'm thinking of is related to equidistribution modulo 2π. If the angle increments are irrational multiples of 2π, then the sequence wraps around the circle densely, leading the sine and cosine values to be dense in [-1, 1]. So in this case, since we're adding 1 radian each time, and 1 is not a rational multiple of 2π, because that would require 1 = 2π * (p\/q) for integers p, q, which would imply π is rational, which it's not. Therefore, the sequence {n mod 2π} is dense in [0, 2π), which implies that sin(n) and cos(n) are dense in [-1, 1].\n\nBut maybe I should verify this more carefully. Let's think about the fractional parts of n\/(2π). If the fractional parts are dense in [0, 1), then multiplying by 2π would give angles dense in [0, 2π). By Weyl's equidistribution theorem, if α is irrational, then the sequence nα mod 1 is equidistributed in [0, 1). Here, α would be 1\/(2π), which is irrational because π is transcendental. Therefore, yes, the fractional parts of n\/(2π) are dense, so the angles n mod 2π are dense in [0, 2π). Therefore, sin(n) and cos(n) must be dense in [-1, 1].\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify any conditions on n except that it's a natural number. So the assumptions here are that n ranges over natural numbers, and the question is about the density of the images under sine and cosine. \n\nTherefore, the problem doesn't have any explicit assumptions beyond n being a natural number, but implicitly relies on the fact that 1 radian is an irrational multiple of 2π, leading to the density. However, in the problem statement, the user doesn't mention any specific constraints or additional conditions, so the only assumption is that n is a natural number. But in the example given by the user, they included an assumption like \"n is divisible by 7\", which was part of the original problem's assumptions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal example:\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) - 6^n (3^n + 2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That contradicts the original problem's statement. Maybe the user made a mistake in their example. But according to their instruction, the task is to filter out unrelated information and list the assumptions. However, in that example, the original problem didn't have the assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the formatted version added it. That seems wrong. Maybe the user intended to include necessary assumptions even if they weren't explicitly stated? But that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it in the formatted version. Hmm, this is unclear. \n\nBut in the current problem about sine function, the user hasn't mentioned any restrictions on n. The question is simply whether {sin(n) | n ∈ ℕ} is dense in [-1,1]. So the only assumption is that n is a natural number. Therefore, following the example structure, the assumptions would be \"n is a natural number\", and the problem is to prove that A is dense in [-1,1]. Similarly for cosine. \n\nWait, but the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps the user's example was incorrect, but according to the instructions, I should list all assumptions from the original problem. In the original problem here, the user states: \"We know that the sine function takes its values between [-1,1]. So is the set A = { sin(n) : n ∈ ℕ } dense in [-1,1].\" So the assumptions here are that n is a natural number, and the problem is to prove density. Therefore, the formatted problem should list \"n is a natural number\" as the assumption, and the problem is to prove A is dense in [-1,1]. Similarly for B with cosine.\n\nBut wait, the original example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. However, in their formatted version, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems to be part of the problem's conditions. But perhaps the original problem had a hidden assumption? Not sure. But in the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a natural number, so that should be listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are implicit assumptions. For example, the sine function's periodicity and the fact that 1 radian is irrational with respect to π. But those are mathematical facts, not assumptions about the problem's variables. The problem's explicit assumption is that n is in ℕ, so that's the only one to list. \n\nTherefore, following the user's format, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set A = { sin(n) : n ∈ ℕ } is dense in [-1, 1]. Similarly, prove that B = { cos(n) : n ∈ ℕ } is dense in [-1, 1].\n\nBut in the example, they split assumptions into separate lines, each addressing one property. So \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" were separate. In the current problem, the only assumption is that n is a natural number. However, maybe the user expects to note that the sine and cosine functions are considered with their standard definitions, but that's too trivial. Alternatively, perhaps there's an assumption that the problem is considering the standard topology on [-1,1], but again, that's implicit. \n\nGiven the example, the key is to list all explicit assumptions from the problem. The original problem states \"n ∈ ℕ\", so that's the assumption. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the set A = { sin(n) : n ∈ ℕ } is dense in [-1,1]. Similarly, can one prove that the set B = { cos(n) : n ∈ ℕ } is dense in [-1,1]?\n\nBut in the example, the problem was restructured to focus on the core, removing the conversational parts. The original question had some discussion, like \"Generally, for showing the set is dense, one proceeds by finding out what is the closure of A...\", but in the formatted version, that's removed. So here, the problem should be condensed to the essential question.",
