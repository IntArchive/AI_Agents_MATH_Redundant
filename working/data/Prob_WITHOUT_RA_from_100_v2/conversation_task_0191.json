Since $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$, if $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can use the given equation more directly. Since $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:\\n$a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.\\nThus $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.\\n\\nNow consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. If $g(a) \\\\neq g(b)$, then $f$ would map two different inputs to different outputs, which doesn't contradict injectivity.

So for $x = f(a)$, we have:\n$f(f(a)) + g(f(a)) = f(a) = y$.\n\nThis doesn't directly help. Let's try a cleaner approach:\n\nAssume $f(a) = f(b)$. We want to show $a = b$.\nFrom the given: $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.\nSo $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.\n\nNow consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$.\nIf $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$ and we're done.\nIf $g(a) \\neq g(b)$, then $f$ maps $g(a)$ to $a$ and $g(b)$ to $b$.\nBut we also have $f(a) = f(b)$. So $f$ maps $a$ and $b$ to the same value $y$.\n\nConsider applying $g$ to $y$: $g(y) = y - f(y)$ by the given equation.\nBut $f(g(y)) = y$ by definition.\n\nActually, let's prove injectivity by contradiction. Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ but $a \\neq b$.\nThen $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(a) + g(b)$, so $a - b = g(a) - g(b) \\neq 0$.\nThus $g(a) \\neq g(b)$.\n\nNow $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. Since $a \\neq b$, we have $f(g(a)) \\neq f(g(b))$.\nBut $g(a) \\neq g(b)$, so this doesn't give a contradiction.\n\nWait, we need to use the fact that $g$ itself satisfies a similar property. From $f(g(x)) = x$, we can apply the given equation to $g(x)$:\n$f(g(x)) + g(g(x)) = g(x)$ for all $x$.\nBut $f(g(x)) = x$, so $x + g(g(x)) = g(x)$, or $g(g(x)) = g(x) - x$.\n\nThis might help. Let's continue with surjectivity first and see if that helps with injectivity.\n\n**Step 2: Prove $f$ is surjective.**\nFor any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we need to find $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$.\n\nConsider $x = y + g(y)$. Then:\n$f(x) = f(y + g(y))$.\nWe need to show this equals $y$.\n\nFrom the given equation applied to $y$: $f(y) + g(y) = y$, so $g(y) = y - f(y)$.\nThus $x = y + (y - f(y)) = 2y - f(y)$.\n\nThis doesn't seem to directly give $f(x) = y$. Let's try a different approach.\n\nTake $x = g(y)$. Then $f(x) = f(g(y)) = y$ by definition of $g$.\nSo for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $x = g(y)$ satisfies $f(x) = y$.\nThus $f$ is surjective!\n\n**Step 3: Now prove $f$ is injective using surjectivity.**\nWe know $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(a) = f(b)$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exist $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $a = g(u)$ and $b = g(v)$.\nThen $f(g(u)) = u$ and $f(g(v)) = v$.\nBut $f(g(u)) = f(a) = f(b) = f(g(v))$, so $u = v$.\nThus $a = g(u) = g(v) = b$.\nTherefore $f$ is injective.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nSince $f$ is both injective and surjective, $f$ is bijective.\n\n**Step 5: Verification.**\nNow that we've proven $f$ is bijective, the inverse function $f^{-1}$ exists properly and satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The given equation $f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x$ holds with this properly defined inverse, completing the proof.\n\nThus, under the given assumptions, $f$ is bijective.",
