Since $p_n$ is distinct from $p_1, \\\\dots, p_{n-1}$, $\\\\sqrt{p_n}$ cannot be expressed as such a linear combination. (Formally, one can use field theory: $[\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_n}):\\\\mathbb{Q}] = 2^n$, so $\\\\sqrt{p_n}$ has degree 2 over $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_{n-1}})$.)\\n\\nSince $\\\\sqrt{p_n} \\\\notin \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, the set $\\\\{1, \\\\sqrt{p_n}\\\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.

By the inductive hypothesis, $B_{n-1} = \\\\{b_{\\\\epsilon'}\\\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.

Therefore $B_n$ is linearly independent over $\\\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Step 3: Spanning Property:**\\nAny element $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_n}]$ can be written as $x = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta\\\\sqrt{p_n}$ with $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{p_1}, \\\\dots, \\\\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.

The elements are linearly independent since a + b√p_1 = 0 with a,b ∈ Q implies a=b=0 (as √p_1 is irrational). They span Q[√p_1] since any element is of form a + b√p_1.\nStep 2) Inductive hypothesis: Assume B_{n-1} is a Q-basis of Q[√p_1,...,√p_{n-1}].\nStep 3) Express Q[√p_1,...,√p_n] as Q[√p_1,...,√p_{n-1}][√p_n]. Note that elements of B_n can be partitioned into two sets: those with ε_n=0 (elements of B_{n-1}) and those with ε_n=1 (elements of B_{n-1} multiplied by √p_n).\nStep 4) Prove linear independence: Suppose Σ_{ε∈{0,1}^n} a_ε√(p_1^{ε_1})...√(p_n^{ε_n}) = 0. Group terms by ε_n value to get Σ_{ε'∈{0,1}^{n-1}} a_{(ε',0)}b_ε' + √p_n Σ_{ε'∈{0,1}^{n-1}} a_{(ε',1)}b_ε' = 0, where b_ε' ∈ B_{n-1}.\nStep 5) Since {1, √p_n} are linearly independent over Q[√p_1,...,√p_{n-1}] (as √p_n is not in this field), both sums must be zero: Σ a_{(ε',0)}b_ε' = 0 and Σ a_{(ε',1)}b_ε' = 0.\nStep 6) By inductive hypothesis (B_{n-1} is linearly independent), all coefficients a_{(ε',0)} = 0 and a_{(ε',1)} = 0. Thus all a_ε = 0, proving B_n is linearly independent.\nStep 7) Prove spanning: Any x ∈ Q[√p_1,...,√p_n] can be written as x = α + β√p_n with α,β ∈ Q[√p_1,...,√p_{n-1}]. By induction, α = Σ c_ε'b_ε' and β = Σ d_ε'b_ε' for some c_ε', d_ε' ∈ Q. Then x = Σ c_ε'b_ε' + √p_n Σ d_ε'b_ε', which is a Q-linear combination of B_n.\nStep 8) Conclude B_n is both linearly independent and spanning, hence a Q-basis of Q[√p_1,...,√p_n].",

Hence $\\{1, \\sqrt{p_1}\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2. **Spanning:** Any element of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}]$ is of the form $a + b\\sqrt{p_1}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which is clearly a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of $1$ and $\\sqrt{p_1}$.\n\nThus $B_1$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-basis of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}]$.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume for $n-1 \\geq 1$ that $B_{n-1}$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-basis of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.

Partition $B_n$ into two subsets:\n- When $\\epsilon_n = 0$: $\\sqrt{p_1^{\\epsilon_1}} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}}} \\cdot 1 = b_{\\epsilon'}$ (these are exactly the elements of $B_{n-1}$).\n- When $\\epsilon_n = 1$: $\\sqrt{p_1^{\\epsilon_1}} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}}} \\cdot \\sqrt{p_n} = b_{\\epsilon'} \\sqrt{p_n}$.\nThus $B_n = B_{n-1} \\cup \\{b_{\\epsilon'} \\sqrt{p_n} : \\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Linear Independence of $B_n$:**\nSuppose we have a linear relation:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} a_{\\epsilon} \\sqrt{p_1^{\\epsilon_1}} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_n^{\\epsilon_n}} = 0$$\nwith coefficients $a_{\\epsilon} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nGroup terms by the value of $\\epsilon_n$:\n$$\\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',0)} b_{\\epsilon'} + \\sqrt{p_n} \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',1)} b_{\\epsilon'} = 0$$\n\nLet $A = \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',0)} b_{\\epsilon'}$ and $B = \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',1)} b_{\\epsilon'}$. Then we have:\n$$A + B\\sqrt{p_n} = 0$$\nwhere $A, B \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\n\n**Claim:** $\\sqrt{p_n} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.\nProof: If $\\sqrt{p_n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, then by the inductive hypothesis, $\\sqrt{p_n}$ would be a $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear combination of $B_{n-1}$. But each element of $B_{n-1}$ is of the form $\\sqrt{p_1^{\\epsilon_1}} \\cdots \\sqrt{p_{n-1}^{\\epsilon_{n-1}}}$, and squaring such an element gives a product of primes $p_i$ to powers $\\epsilon_i$. Since $p_n$ is distinct from $p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}$, $\\sqrt{p_n}$ cannot be expressed as such a linear combination. (Formally, one can use field theory: $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2^n$, so $\\sqrt{p_n}$ has degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}})$.)\n\nSince $\\sqrt{p_n} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$, the set $\\{1, \\sqrt{p_n}\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$. Therefore, from $A + B\\sqrt{p_n} = 0$, we must have $A = 0$ and $B = 0$.\n\nNow $A = \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',0)} b_{\\epsilon'} = 0$ and $B = \\sum_{\\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}} a_{(\\epsilon',1)} b_{\\epsilon'} = 0$. By the inductive hypothesis, $B_{n-1} = \\{b_{\\epsilon'}\\}$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Hence all coefficients must be zero:\n$$a_{(\\epsilon',0)} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{(\\epsilon',1)} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\epsilon' \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n-1}$$\nThus all $a_{\\epsilon} = 0$ for $\\epsilon \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. Therefore $B_n$ is linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Spanning Property:**\nAny element $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_n}]$ can be written as $x = \\alpha + \\beta\\sqrt{p_n}$ with $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{p_1}, \\dots, \\sqrt{p_{n-1}}]$.
