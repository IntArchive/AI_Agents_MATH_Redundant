For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p (i.e., in 𝔽_p[x])\\n\\n**Part 1: Irreducibility in ℤ[x]**\\n\\nWe use Eisenstein's criterion. First, make the substitution x = y + 1. Then:\\n\\nx^4 + 1 = (y + 1)^4 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2\\n\\nNow consider this polynomial in ℤ[y]: f(y) = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2.\\n\\nCheck Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = 2:\\n- All coefficients except the leading coefficient are divisible by 2:\\n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\\n  - 6 ≡ 0 mod 2  \\n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\\n  - 2 ≡ 0 mod 2\\n- The constant term 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 2^2 = 4\\n- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2\\n\\nThus by Eisenstein's criterion with p = 2, f(y) is irreducible in ℤ[y]. Since the substitution x = y + 1 is an automorphism of ℤ[x] (it's invertible with inverse y = x - 1), the irreducibility of f(y) implies the irreducibility of x^4 + 1 in ℤ[x].\\n\\n**Part 2: Reducibility modulo every prime p**\\n\\nWe consider two cases: p = 2 and p odd.\\n\\n**Case 1: p = 2**\\nIn 𝔽_2[x], we have:\\nx^4 + 1 = x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)^4 in 𝔽_2[x] since (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 = x^4 + 1 in 𝔽_2 (all coefficients except first and last are even, hence 0 mod 2).\\nThus x^4 + 1 is clearly reducible modulo 2.\\n\\n**Case 2: p odd prime**\\nLet p be an odd prime. We work in the finite field 𝔽_p.\\n\\n**Lemma**: In any finite field 𝔽_q of odd characteristic, -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\\nProof: The multiplicative group 𝔽_{q^2}^× is cyclic of order q^2 - 1. Since q is odd, q^2 - 1 = (q - 1)(q + 1) is divisible by 4 (as both q-1 and q+1 are even). Thus there exists an element α ∈ 𝔽_{q^2}^× of order 4. Then α^2 has order 2, so α^2 = -1. Hence -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\\n\\nNow take q = p. Since -1 is a square in 𝔽_{p^2}, there exists β ∈ 𝔽_{p^2} such that β^2 = -1.\\n\\nConsider the polynomial x^4 + 1. We can factor it as:\\nx^4 + 1 = (x^2)^2 - (-1) = (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) in 𝔽_{p^2}[x]\\n\\nBut we need factors in 𝔽_p[x]. Note that β and -β are conjugates over 𝔽_p since they satisfy the same minimal polynomial x^2 + 1. More precisely, if β ∉ 𝔽_p, then its conjugate under the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p is β^p = -β (since (β^2)^p = (-1)^p = -1, and β^p = ±β, but β ∉ 𝔽_p implies β^p ≠ β, so β^p = -β).\\n\\nThus the product (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) has coefficients in 𝔽_p. To see this explicitly:\\n(x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) = x^4 - β^2 = x^4 + 1\\n\\nAlternatively, we can find an explicit factorization in 𝔽_p[x]. Let a ∈ 𝔽_p be such that a^2 = -1 if -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, or find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p such that a^2 + b^2 = -1 if -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. In fact:\\n\\n- If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, so there exists a ∈ 𝔽_p with a^2 = -1. Then:\\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + a)(x^2 - a) in 𝔽_p[x]\\n\\n- If p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. However, we can find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p, not both zero, such that a^2 + b^2 = -1. This is always possible in finite fields. Then:\\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) in 𝔽_p[x]\\n  To verify: (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2\\n  We need 2b - a^2 = 0 and b^2 = 1. So we need a^2 = 2b and b^2 = 1, hence b = ±1.\\n  If b = 1, we need a^2 = 2. If 2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\\n  If b = -1, we need a^2 = -2. If -2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\\n  For p ≡ 3 mod 4, one of 2 or -2 is always a square in 𝔽_p.\\n\\nA more uniform approach: In 𝔽_p, consider the polynomial x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1). The roots of x^8 - 1 are the 8th roots of unity. In characteristic p, if p ≠ 2, the 8th roots of unity exist in some extension field. Since the Galois group of the splitting field is abelian, all irreducible factors of x^4 + 1 over 𝔽_p have the same degree. This degree divides 4 and must be 1 or 2 (since if it were 4, x^4 + 1 would be irreducible over 𝔽_p, but we can show this never happens).\\n\\n**Complete proof for odd p**:\\nLet ζ be a primitive 8th root of unity in some extension of 𝔽_p. Then ζ^4 = -1, so ζ^2 is a primitive 4th root of unity. The roots of x^4 + 1 are ζ, ζ^3, ζ^5, ζ^7.\\n\\nConsider the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p. The orbit of ζ under σ determines the minimal polynomial. We have:\\nσ(ζ) = ζ^p\\n\\nSince the multiplicative order of ζ is 8, and p is odd, p mod 8 is either 1, 3, 5, or 7.\\n\\n- If p ≡ ±1 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±1}, so the orbit has size 1 or 2, giving linear or quadratic factors.\\n- If p ≡ ±3 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±3}, and ζ^{p^2} = ζ^{9} = ζ (since ζ^8 = 1), so the orbit has size 2, giving quadratic factors.\\n\\nThus in all cases, x^4 + 1 factors into polynomials of degree at most 2 over 𝔽_p.\\n\\n**Explicit factorizations**:\\n- For p ≡ 1 mod 8: x^4 + 1 splits completely into linear factors.\\n- For p ≡ 5 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\\n- For p ≡ 3 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\\n- For p ≡ 7 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.\\n\\nIn all cases, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p.\\n\\n**Conclusion**:\\nWe have shown:\\n1. x^4 + 1 is irreducible in ℤ[x] by Eisenstein's criterion after substitution.\\n2. For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible in 𝔽_p[x] (trivially for p=2, and by the above argument for odd p).\\n\\nThis completes the proof.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

If -2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\n  For p ≡ 3 mod 4, one of 2 or -2 is always a square in 𝔽_p.\n\nA more uniform approach: In 𝔽_p, consider the polynomial x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1). The roots of x^8 - 1 are the 8th roots of unity. In characteristic p, if p ≠ 2, the 8th roots of unity exist in some extension field. Since the Galois group of the splitting field is abelian, all irreducible factors of x^4 + 1 over 𝔽_p have the same degree. This degree divides 4 and must be 1 or 2 (since if it were 4, x^4 + 1 would be irreducible over 𝔽_p, but we can show this never happens).\n\n**Complete proof for odd p**:\nLet ζ be a primitive 8th root of unity in some extension of 𝔽_p.

For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p (i.e., in 𝔽_p[x])\n\n**Part 1: Irreducibility in ℤ[x]**\n\nWe use Eisenstein's criterion. First, make the substitution x = y + 1. Then:\n\nx^4 + 1 = (y + 1)^4 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2\n\nNow consider this polynomial in ℤ[y]: f(y) = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2.\n\nCheck Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = 2:\n- All coefficients except the leading coefficient are divisible by 2:\n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\n  - 6 ≡ 0 mod 2  \n  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2\n  - 2 ≡ 0 mod 2\n- The constant term 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 2^2 = 4\n- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2\n\nThus by Eisenstein's criterion with p = 2, f(y) is irreducible in ℤ[y]. Since the substitution x = y + 1 is an automorphism of ℤ[x] (it's invertible with inverse y = x - 1), the irreducibility of f(y) implies the irreducibility of x^4 + 1 in ℤ[x].\n\n**Part 2: Reducibility modulo every prime p**\n\nWe consider two cases: p = 2 and p odd.\n\n**Case 1: p = 2**\nIn 𝔽_2[x], we have:\nx^4 + 1 = x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)^4 in 𝔽_2[x] since (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 = x^4 + 1 in 𝔽_2 (all coefficients except first and last are even, hence 0 mod 2).\nThus x^4 + 1 is clearly reducible modulo 2.\n\n**Case 2: p odd prime**\nLet p be an odd prime. We work in the finite field 𝔽_p.\n\n**Lemma**: In any finite field 𝔽_q of odd characteristic, -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\nProof: The multiplicative group 𝔽_{q^2}^× is cyclic of order q^2 - 1. Since q is odd, q^2 - 1 = (q - 1)(q + 1) is divisible by 4 (as both q-1 and q+1 are even). Thus there exists an element α ∈ 𝔽_{q^2}^× of order 4. Then α^2 has order 2, so α^2 = -1. Hence -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.\n\nNow take q = p. Since -1 is a square in 𝔽_{p^2}, there exists β ∈ 𝔽_{p^2} such that β^2 = -1.\n\nConsider the polynomial x^4 + 1. We can factor it as:\nx^4 + 1 = (x^2)^2 - (-1) = (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) in 𝔽_{p^2}[x]\n\nBut we need factors in 𝔽_p[x]. Note that β and -β are conjugates over 𝔽_p since they satisfy the same minimal polynomial x^2 + 1. More precisely, if β ∉ 𝔽_p, then its conjugate under the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p is β^p = -β (since (β^2)^p = (-1)^p = -1, and β^p = ±β, but β ∉ 𝔽_p implies β^p ≠ β, so β^p = -β).\n\nThus the product (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) has coefficients in 𝔽_p. To see this explicitly:\n(x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) = x^4 - β^2 = x^4 + 1\n\nAlternatively, we can find an explicit factorization in 𝔽_p[x]. Let a ∈ 𝔽_p be such that a^2 = -1 if -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, or find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p such that a^2 + b^2 = -1 if -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. In fact:\n\n- If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, so there exists a ∈ 𝔽_p with a^2 = -1. Then:\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + a)(x^2 - a) in 𝔽_p[x]\n\n- If p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. However, we can find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p, not both zero, such that a^2 + b^2 = -1. This is always possible in finite fields. Then:\n  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) in 𝔽_p[x]\n  To verify: (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2\n  We need 2b - a^2 = 0 and b^2 = 1. So we need a^2 = 2b and b^2 = 1, hence b = ±1.\n  If b = 1, we need a^2 = 2. If 2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\n  If b = -1, we need a^2 = -2. If -2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.\n  For p ≡ 3 mod 4, one of 2 or -2 is always a square in 𝔽_p.\n\nA more uniform approach: In 𝔽_p, consider the polynomial x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1).
