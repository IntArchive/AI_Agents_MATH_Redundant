    "AcceptedAnswer":"By considering Taylor series, $\\displaystyle e^x \\geq \\frac{x^n}{n!}$ for all $x\\geq 0,$ and $n\\in \\mathbb{N}.$ In particular, for $x=n$ this yields $$ n! \\geq \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n .$$ Thus $$\\sqrt[n]{n!} \\geq \\frac{n}{e} \\to \\infty.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that the limit of the nth root of n factorial as n approaches infinity is infinite. So, the expression is limₙ→∞ ⁿ√(n!). \n\nFirst, I need to recall some related limits or theorems that might help. I remember that Stirling's approximation approximates n! for large n. It states that n! ≈ nⁿ e⁻ⁿ √(2πn). Maybe using Stirling's formula can help here. If I substitute that approximation into the nth root, let's see:\n\nⁿ√(n!) ≈ ⁿ√(nⁿ e⁻ⁿ √(2πn)) = (nⁿ e⁻ⁿ √(2πn))^(1\/n) = n e⁻¹ (2πn)^(1\/(2n)).\n\nNow, as n approaches infinity, the term (2πn)^(1\/(2n)) should approach 1 because the exponent 1\/(2n) goes to 0, and any term to the power 0 is 1. So, the limit simplifies to n\/e. But wait, n is approaching infinity, so n\/e would go to infinity. Therefore, the limit should be infinity.\n\nBut maybe I should verify this without relying on Stirling's approximation since the problem might expect a more elementary approach. Let's think about using logarithms to simplify the expression. Taking the natural logarithm of the nth root of n! gives (1\/n) ln(n!). Then, the limit of that as n approaches infinity is the same as the limit of (1\/n) Σₖ=1ⁿ ln(k). \n\nThis looks like an average of the logarithms of the integers from 1 to n. Maybe we can compare this sum to an integral. The integral of ln(x) from 1 to n is n ln(n) - n + 1. So, the sum Σₖ=1ⁿ ln(k) is approximately the integral from 1 to n of ln(x) dx, which is n ln(n) - n + 1. Therefore, (1\/n)(n ln(n) - n + 1) = ln(n) - 1 + 1\/n. As n approaches infinity, ln(n) - 1 + 1\/n approaches infinity. Therefore, the logarithm of the original expression tends to infinity, so the original limit must also be infinity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the comparison test. For example, note that n! ≥ (n\/2)^(n\/2) for sufficiently large n. Then, ⁿ√(n!) ≥ ⁿ√((n\/2)^(n\/2)) = (n\/2)^(1\/2) = √(n\/2). As n approaches infinity, √(n\/2) tends to infinity, so the original limit must also be infinite.\n\nAnother approach could be using the ratio test. Consider the sequence aₙ = ⁿ√(n!). Then, aₙ = e^{(1\/n) Σₖ=1ⁿ ln(k)}. If we can show that this exponent goes to infinity, then aₙ does too. As before, using the integral approximation, the exponent tends to infinity, so the limit is infinity.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler way. For example, using the fact that n! grows faster than any exponential function. Since n! is greater than (n\/2)^(n\/2), as I mentioned before, taking the nth root gives something like sqrt(n\/2), which clearly goes to infinity. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is indeed infinite. Therefore, the answer should be that the limit is infinity, and the key assumptions are that n is a positive integer approaching infinity.",
