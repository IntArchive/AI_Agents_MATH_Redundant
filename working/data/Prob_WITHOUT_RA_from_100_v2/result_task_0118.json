    "Content":"Suppose $A$ and $B$ are similar matrices. Show that $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities. Similar matrices : Suppose $A$ and $B$ are $n\\times n$ matrices over $\\mathbb R$ or $\\mathbb C$. We say $A$ and $B$ are similar, or that $A$ is similar to $B$, if there exists a matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP$.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"$B = P^{-1}AP \\ \\Longleftrightarrow \\ PBP^{-1} = A$ . If $Av = \\lambda v$ , then $PBP^{-1}v = \\lambda v \\ \\Longrightarrow \\ BP^{-1}v = \\lambda P^{-1}v$ . So, if $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ , with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ , then $P^{-1}v$ is an eigenvector of $B$ with the same eigenvalue. So, every eigenvalue of $A$ is an eigenvalue of $B$ and since you can interchange the roles of $A$ and $B$ in the previous calculations, every eigenvalue of $B$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ too. Hence, $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues. Geometrically, in fact, also $v$ and $P^{-1}v$ are the same vector, written in different coordinate systems. Geometrically, $A$ and $B$ are matrices associated with the same endomorphism. So, they have the same eigenvalues and geometric multiplicities.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a math professor, read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated info, and present it with Assumptions and Problem sections. \n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving a number is divisible by 91. The formatted version listed assumptions like n being an integer and n being divisible by 7, then the problem statement. So the key is to extract each individual condition or property applied to one object per line.\n\nNow, looking at the Math Stack Exchange question here: \"Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicity\". The user is asking to show that similar matrices A and B have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities. The question defines similar matrices as n×n matrices over R or C, where B = P⁻¹AP for some invertible matrix P.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. A and B are similar matrices. That means there exists a matrix P such that B = P⁻¹AP.\n2. A and B are n×n matrices. The field is either real numbers or complex numbers.\n3. The problem is to show they have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities.\n\nWait, but the problem statement is the actual question. So the assumptions are the given conditions. So the similarity, the size of the matrices, the field. But in the example, the assumption included n being an integer and n divisible by 7. So here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A and B are n×n matrices over R or C.\n- A and B are similar (there exists invertible P such that B = P⁻¹AP).\n- The problem is to show they share eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities.\n\nBut the original problem statement might not mention the field (R or C) as part of the problem, but in the question, the user says \"Suppose A and B are n×n matrices over R or C\". So that's a condition, so that's an assumption. Each assumption line by line. So:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are n×n matrices,\nThe entries of A and B are real or complex numbers,\nThere exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P⁻¹AP.\n\nProblem: Show that A and B have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which was part of the problem but not stated in the original question. Wait, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like maybe the example is wrong? Wait, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was modified? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, but I need to follow the user's example. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted version's assumption included \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. But maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user intended to add an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake, but I should follow the user's instruction regardless.\n\nBut in the current problem, the user's question on Math Stack Exchange is about similar matrices having the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities. The user defines similar matrices as n×n over R or C, with B = P⁻¹AP. So, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A and B are n×n matrices.\n- The entries of A and B are real or complex numbers.\n- There exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P⁻¹AP.\n\nProblem: Show that A and B have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities.\n\nBut wait, geometric multiplicity refers to the dimension of the eigenspace. So the problem is to show that each eigenvalue has the same geometric multiplicity for both matrices. \n\nNow, checking if there's any other assumptions. The original problem says \"Suppose A and B are similar matrices. Show that...\". So the main assumptions are similarity, being n×n, over R or C. So each of these should be separate lines in the assumption section. The problem is to show the eigenvalues and their geometric multiplicities are the same.\n\nI think that's all. So, formatted as:\n\nAssumption:\nA and B are n×n matrices,\nA and B have entries from the real or complex numbers,\nThere exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P⁻¹AP.\n\nProblem:\nShow that A and B have the same eigenvalues with the same geometric multiplicities.\n\nYes, that seems to fit the example's structure. Each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So the first assumption is about the size of the matrices, the second about the field, the third about their similarity. Then the problem is the statement to prove.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: A and B have real or complex entries\nAssumption 2: There exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP\nProblem:\nProve that A and B are n × n matrices\nWe are given that A and B are matrices with real or complex entries, and there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP. We need to prove that A and B are square matrices of the same size.\n\nLet us denote the dimensions of the matrices as follows:\n- Let A be an m × n matrix (m rows, n columns)\n- Let P be a p × q matrix (p rows, q columns)\n- Let B be an r × s matrix (r rows, s columns)\n\nWe will analyze the dimensions step by step:\n\n1. **Invertibility of P implies P is square:** Since P is invertible, it must be a square matrix. This means p = q, and P^{-1} exists and is also a p × p matrix.\n\n2. **Compatibility of P^{-1}A:** For the matrix product P^{-1}A to be defined, the number of columns of P^{-1} must equal the number of rows of A. Since P^{-1} is p × p, it has p columns. Matrix A has m rows. Therefore, we must have p = m.\n\n3. **Compatibility of (P^{-1}A)P:** The product P^{-1}A results in a matrix whose dimensions are determined by the outer dimensions: P^{-1} is p × p and A is m × n, so P^{-1}A is p × n (since p = m from step 2). For the product (P^{-1}A)P to be defined, the number of columns of P^{-1}A must equal the number of rows of P. P^{-1}A has n columns, and P has p rows. Therefore, we must have n = p.\n\n4. **Deduction of dimensions:** From step 2, we have m = p. From step 3, we have n = p. Therefore, m = n = p. This means:\n   - A is an n × n matrix (since m = n)\n   - P is an n × n matrix (since p = n)\n   - P^{-1} is also n × n\n\n5. **Dimension of B:** Since B = P^{-1}AP, and all matrices on the right-hand side are n × n, the product P^{-1}AP is also an n × n matrix. Therefore, B is an n × n matrix.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** We have shown that A and B are both n × n matrices. Moreover, they are square matrices of the same size n × n.\n\nThus, given that B = P^{-1}AP with P invertible, it necessarily follows that A and B are square matrices of the same dimension.",
