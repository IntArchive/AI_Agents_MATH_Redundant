    "Content":"I have heard $\\varphi$ called the most irrational number. Numbers are either irrational or not though, one cannot be more \"irrational\" in the sense of a number that can not be represented as a ratio of integers. What is meant by most irrational? Define what we mean by saying one number is more irrational than another, and then prove that there is no $x$ such that $x$ is more irrational than $\\varphi$. Note: I have heard about defining irrationality by how well the number can be approximated by rational ones, but that would need to formalized.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"How well can a number $\\alpha$ be approximated by rationals?\nTrivially, we can find infinitely many $\\frac pq$ with $|\\alpha -\\frac pq|<\\frac 1q$ , so something better is needed to talk about a good approximation.\nFor example, if $d>1$ , $c>0$ and there are infinitely many $\\frac pq$ with $|\\alpha-\\frac pq|<\\frac c{q^d}$ , then we can say that $\\alpha$ can be approximated better than another number if it allows a higher $d$ than that other number. Or for equal values of $d$ , if it allows a smaller $c$ . Intriguingly, numbers that can be approximated exceptionally well by rationals are transcendental (and at the other end of the spectrum, rationals can be approximated exceptionally poorly - if one ignores the exact approximation by the number itself). On the other hand, for every irrational $\\alpha$ , there exists $c>0$ so that for infinitely many rationals $\\frac pq$ we have $|\\alpha-\\frac pq|<\\frac c{q^2}$ . The infimum of allowed $c$ may differ among irrationals and it turns out that it depends on the continued fraction expansion of $\\alpha$ .\nEspecially, terms $\\ge 2$ in the continued fraction correspond to better approximations than those for terms $=1$ . Therefore, any number with infinitely many terms $\\ge 2$ allows a smaller $c$ than a number with only finitely many terms $\\ge2$ in the continued fraction. But if all but finitely many of the terms are $1$ , then $\\alpha$ is simply a rational transform of $\\phi$ , i.e. $\\alpha=a+b\\phi$ with $a\\in\\mathbb Q, b\\in\\mathbb Q^\\times$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know why φ (the golden ratio) is called the \"most irrational number.\" First, I need to recall some concepts from number theory, especially regarding irrational numbers and their approximation by rationals. \n\nSo, the key here is the concept of approximation. I remember that while all irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers, some can be approximated by rational numbers more closely than others, depending on the denominator's size. This is related to the idea of Diophantine approximation. \n\nThe golden ratio φ is (1 + √5)\/2, approximately 1.618. I've heard before that it's considered the \"most irrational\" because it's the hardest to approximate with rationals. But how exactly is that measured?\n\nI think it has to do with the continued fraction expansion. Numbers with periodic continued fractions, like quadratic irrationals, have certain approximation properties. The golden ratio's continued fraction is [1; 1, 1, 1, ...], which is the simplest possible infinite continued fraction. Each convergent (approximation) is as slow as possible in approaching the actual value. This relates to the convergents being the worst approximable in a sense.\n\nThen there's the concept of the Markov constant or the Lagrange number, which measures how well a number can be approximated by rationals. The theorem would be something like Hurwitz's theorem, which states that for any irrational number α, there are infinitely many rationals p\/q such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(√5 q²). Moreover, √5 is the best possible constant here, and the golden ratio is exactly the number for which this bound cannot be improved. That is, for the golden ratio, you can't have a larger constant than √5, hence it's the \"worst\" in terms of approximation, making it the \"most irrational.\"\n\nSo, putting this together, the problem is asking to formalize the notion of one number being more irrational than another based on how poorly they can be approximated by rationals. Then, prove that no number is more irrational than φ under this definition.\n\nThe assumptions would involve the definition of the approximation measure. For example, using the Lagrange spectrum or the concept that a number's irrationality measure is higher if it can be approximated by rationals less accurately. The problem then is to define this measure, and show φ is the maximum.\n\nBut wait, the original question has two parts: define what makes one number more irrational than another, and prove φ is the most irrational. The assumptions would include the definition based on Diophantine approximation, maybe using the infimum of constants c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, φ would have the smallest such c, hence being the worst approximable.\n\nSo structuring the problem:\n\nAssumptions would be the definition of \"more irrational\" in terms of approximation by rationals. Each assumption should be a single condition. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nIrrationality is measured by how poorly a number can be approximated by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, define its approximation constant as the supremum of all c for which |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p\/q,\nA number α is considered \"more irrational\" than β if the approximation constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem: Prove that there is no number x such that the approximation constant of x is smaller than that of φ (which is √5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to define the concept and show φ is the most irrational. The user wants the problem structured into assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nSo in the example given, the original problem's assumptions were n is integer, n divisible by 7. Then the problem is to prove divisibility.\n\nSo here, the assumptions would be:\n\n- Define that a number is \"more irrational\" based on the infimum of constants c such that the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions.\n- The approximation constant for φ is √5.\n- The problem is to show no number has a smaller approximation constant than φ, hence φ is the most irrational.\n\nBut need to check the exact definitions. Wait, Hurwitz's theorem says that for any irrational α, there exist infinitely many p\/q with |α - p\/q| < 1\/(√5 q²). And that √5 is the best possible constant, in the sense that for any larger constant than √5, there are irrationals for which the inequality has only finitely many solutions. The golden ratio is such that for any c > √5, the inequality |φ - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has only finitely many solutions. So the approximation constant (the supremum of c where there are infinitely many solutions) for φ is √5, and this is the minimal such supremum among all irrationals. Hence, φ is the \"most irrational\" because it has the smallest possible supremum c, meaning it's the hardest to approximate.\n\nTherefore, the problem would be structured with assumptions defining the approximation measure, and then the problem to prove φ is the most irrational under that measure.\n\nSo the assumptions in the problem should be each a single line:\n\nAssumption:\nThe irrationality of a number is determined by its approximability by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, define the Lagrange constant as the supremum of all real numbers c for which the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions p\/q ∈ ℚ,\nA number α is \"more irrational\" than β if the Lagrange constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there is no number x such that the Lagrange constant of x is smaller than that of φ (which is √5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to structure the problem as proving φ is the most irrational under the defined terms.\n\nBut perhaps the exact problem is: Define the measure of irrationality as the infimum of all c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, φ has the largest such infimum, hence being the most irrational. Wait, need to check definitions.\n\nWait, the Lagrange constant is the supremum of c such that |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many solutions. Then, the higher the Lagrange constant, the better the number can be approximated (because you can have a larger c, meaning the approximation is tighter). Conversely, a lower Lagrange constant means the number is harder to approximate. Hence, φ has the minimal Lagrange constant (√5), making it the hardest to approximate, hence \"most irrational.\"\n\nThus, the problem is to prove that for any irrational number α, the Lagrange constant is at least √5, and equality holds for φ. So φ has the minimal Lagrange constant, hence is the most irrational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe degree of irrationality of a number is inversely related to how well it can be approximated by rational numbers,\nFor an irrational number α, its Lagrange constant is the supremum of all c > 0 for which there exist infinitely many rational numbers p\/q satisfying |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²),\nA number α is \"more irrational\" than β if the Lagrange constant of α is smaller than that of β.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Lagrange constant of φ is √5 and that no irrational number has a smaller Lagrange constant.\n\nThis would fit the required structure.",

A larger L(α) means there exists a larger c such that infinitely many rational approximations p\/q satisfy the inequality.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the approximation inequality**\nConsider the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²). For fixed c, this inequality gives a measure of approximation quality:\n- Smaller values of the right-hand side 1\/(c q²) mean the approximation must be more accurate\n- Larger c makes 1\/(c q²) smaller, requiring better approximations\n- Smaller c makes 1\/(c q²) larger, allowing worse approximations\n\nThus, the inequality with larger c represents a stricter (higher quality) approximation requirement.\n\n**Step 3: Relating L(α) to approximation quality**\nIf L(α) is large, then for many large values of c, there exist infinitely many rational approximations p\/q satisfying |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²). This means α has many high-quality approximations.\n\nConversely, if L(α) is small, then for most large values of c, the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has only finitely many solutions. This means α has relatively few high-quality approximations.\n\n**Step 4: Formal comparison of two numbers**\nLet α and β be irrational numbers with L(α) < L(β). Choose any c such that L(α) < c < L(β). By definition of supremum:\n1. Since c > L(α), the inequality |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has only finitely many rational solutions p\/q.\n2. Since c < L(β), the inequality |β - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p\/q.\n\nThis shows that for the approximation quality threshold 1\/(c q²), β has infinitely many approximations while α has only finitely many.\n\n**Step 5: Extending to all approximation qualities**\nMore generally, for any approximation quality threshold ε > 0, we can consider the inequality |α - p\/q| < ε\/q². This is equivalent to |α - p\/q| < 1\/(c q²) where c = 1\/ε.\n\nIf L(α) < L(β), then for sufficiently small ε (equivalently, sufficiently large c = 1\/ε with c > L(α)), α will have only finitely many approximations satisfying |α - p\/q| < ε\/q², while β will have infinitely many such approximations.\n\n**Step 6: Connecting to intuitive notion of 'more irrational'**\nThe intuitive concept of 'more irrational' means that a number is harder to approximate well by rational numbers. Our analysis shows:\n- When L(α) < L(β), there exists an approximation quality threshold such that β has infinitely many approximations at that quality while α has only finitely many\n- This means β admits better rational approximations than α\n- Equivalently, α is harder to approximate well by rationals than β\n- Therefore, α is 'more irrational' than β\n\n**Conclusion:** The definition that α is 'more irrational' than β if L(α) < L(β) precisely captures the intuitive notion that α is harder to approximate well by rational numbers than β. The Lagrange constant L(α) measures the supremum of constants c for which high-quality approximations exist, so a smaller Lagrange constant indicates poorer approximation properties, which corresponds to being 'more irrational'.",
