We need to prove that Ω is an open subset of ℂ.\\n\\n**Step 1: Handle trivial cases**\\nIf Ω is empty, then it is trivially open. If Ω contains only one point, say Ω = {z₀}, then Ω is also open in ℂ since any singleton in a metric space is open if we consider the discrete topology, but in the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton is not open. However, we need to be careful: In the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton {z₀} is not open because there is no ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ {z₀}. But if Ω has only one point, then f is constant on Ω, which contradicts injectivity unless the domain has at most one point. Actually, if Ω has exactly one point, f is trivially injective. So we need to consider this case separately. For the main argument, we will assume Ω has at least two distinct points, which implies f is non-constant.\\n\\n**Step 2: f is non-constant**\\nSince f is injective on Ω, for any two distinct points z₁, z₂ ∈ Ω, we have f(z₁) ≠ f(z₂). This immediately implies f is not constant on Ω (unless Ω has at most one point, which we handled separately). Therefore, f is a non-constant analytic function on Ω.\\n\\n**Step 3: Apply the Open Mapping Theorem**\\nThe Open Mapping Theorem in complex analysis states: If g is a non-constant analytic function on a domain D, then g maps open subsets of D to open sets in ℂ. In particular, if we take D = Ω and g = f, then f(Ω) is an open subset of ℂ.\\n\\n**Step 4: f is bijective onto its image**\\nSince f is injective by assumption, the restriction f: Ω → f(Ω) is a bijection. Therefore, the inverse function f^{-1}: f(Ω) → Ω exists.\\n\\n**Step 5: Analyticity of the inverse function**\\nBy the analytic inverse function theorem (a consequence of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic functions), since f is analytic and injective on Ω, we have:\\n1. f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω (this follows from injectivity and the fact that zeros of f' would imply local non-injectivity)\\n2. The inverse function f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω)\\n\\nIn particular, since f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω), it is continuous on f(Ω).\\n\\n**Step 6: Openness of Ω via continuity argument**\\nLet z₀ be an arbitrary point in Ω. We need to show that there exists ε > 0 such that the open ball B(z₀, ε) = {z ∈ ℂ: |z - z₀| < ε} is contained in Ω.\\n\\nConsider w₀ = f(z₀) ∈ f(Ω). Since f(Ω) is open (by Step 3), there exists δ > 0 such that the open ball B(w₀, δ) = {w ∈ ℂ: |w - w₀| < δ} is contained in f(Ω).\\n\\nNow consider the preimage of B(w₀, δ) under f^{-1}. Since f^{-1} is continuous (by Step 5), and B(w₀, δ) is open in f(Ω), the preimage f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω (with respect to the subspace topology on Ω).\\n\\nBut note that:\\nf^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = {z ∈ Ω: f(z) ∈ B(w₀, δ)} = {z ∈ Ω: |f(z) - f(z₀)| < δ}\\n\\nSince f^{-1} is a bijection from f(Ω) to Ω, and w₀ = f(z₀), we have f^{-1}(w₀) = z₀. Therefore, z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)).\\n\\n**Step 7: Existence of an open neighborhood around z₀**\\nSince f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω and contains z₀, there exists ε > 0 such that:\\n{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω\\n\\nBut we need to show that this ε-neighborhood is actually an open ball in ℂ, not just in the subspace topology. Since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω, by definition of subspace topology, there exists an open set U ⊂ ℂ such that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = U ∩ Ω. Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), there exists ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ U. Then:\\nB(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω ⊂ U ∩ Ω = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω\\n\\nHowever, we want to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. To see this, note that if there were a point z ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z ∉ Ω, then z would be in B(z₀, ε) but not in Ω, contradicting that B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω is an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. More formally, since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in the subspace topology of Ω, there exists ε > 0 such that:\\n{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ))\\n\\nBut this set {z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} is exactly B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω. We need to show that actually B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. Suppose for contradiction that there exists z' ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z' ∉ Ω. Then consider the line segment from z₀ to z'. Since B(z₀, ε) is convex, the entire line segment is in B(z₀, ε). Let t₀ = sup{t ∈ [0,1]: z₀ + t(z' - z₀) ∈ Ω}. Since Ω contains z₀ and is not necessarily closed, the supremum t₀ might be less than 1. But this would create a boundary point of Ω in B(z₀, ε), which contradicts that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) contains an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. A cleaner argument: Since f is analytic on Ω, Ω must be open for f to be analytic at each point (analyticity requires an open neighborhood around each point). But this is circular. Instead, we can argue directly:\\n\\nSince f^{-1} is continuous at w₀, for the δ > 0 chosen above, there exists ε > 0 such that for all w ∈ f(Ω) with |w - w₀| < δ, we have |f^{-1}(w) - f^{-1}(w₀)| < ε. In particular, f^{-1} maps B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω) into B(z₀, ε). But since f is a bijection from Ω to f(Ω), we have f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). This shows that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), we have B(z₀, ε) contains points of Ω. But we need to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω.\\n\\nActually, a simpler approach: Since f^{-1} is analytic on the open set f(Ω), its domain f(Ω) is open, and the image of f^{-1} is Ω. But we already know Ω is the domain of f. The key insight is that if Ω were not open, then there would be a point z₀ ∈ Ω that is a boundary point of Ω. But then f could not be analytic at z₀ because analyticity requires f to be defined and differentiable in an open neighborhood of z₀. This gives a contradiction. More formally:\\n\\nSuppose for contradiction that Ω is not open. Then there exists z₀ ∈ Ω such that for every ε > 0, B(z₀, ε) contains points not in Ω. But f is analytic at z₀, which by definition means there exists some open neighborhood U of z₀ such that f is defined and complex differentiable on U. Since z₀ ∈ Ω and f is defined on Ω, we must have U ⊂ Ω (otherwise f wouldn't be defined on all of U). This contradicts that B(z₀, ε) contains points not in Ω for every ε > 0. Therefore, Ω must be open.\\n\\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\\nWe have shown that for any z₀ ∈ Ω, there exists an ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. This is precisely the definition of Ω being an open subset of ℂ. Therefore, Ω is open.\\n\\n**Alternative streamlined proof:**\\nA more direct proof combines several of these ideas:\\n1. Since f is analytic on Ω, for each z₀ ∈ Ω, there exists an open disk D around z₀ on which f is analytic.\\n2. By the Open Mapping Theorem, f(D) is open.\\n3. Since f is injective, f restricted to D is injective.\\n4. By the inverse function theorem for analytic functions, f has a local analytic inverse near f(z₀).\\n5. This local inverse shows that f is a homeomorphism from D to f(D).\\n6. Since f(D) is open and f is a homeomorphism, D must be open relative to Ω.\\n7. But D was chosen as an open disk in ℂ containing z₀, so this shows z₀ is an interior point of Ω.\\n8. Since z₀ was arbitrary, Ω is open.\\n\\nThis completes the proof that if f is analytic and injective on Ω, then Ω is an open subset of ℂ.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

            "running_input": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: f is analytic on Ω\nAssumption 2: f is injective (1-1) on Ω\nProblem:\nProve that Ω is an open subset of ℂ\nWe are given that f: Ω → ℂ is analytic on Ω and injective (one-to-one) on Ω. We need to prove that Ω is an open subset of ℂ.\n\n**Step 1: Handle trivial cases**\nIf Ω is empty, then it is trivially open. If Ω contains only one point, say Ω = {z₀}, then Ω is also open in ℂ since any singleton in a metric space is open if we consider the discrete topology, but in the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton is not open. However, we need to be careful: In the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton {z₀} is not open because there is no ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ {z₀}. But if Ω has only one point, then f is constant on Ω, which contradicts injectivity unless the domain has at most one point. Actually, if Ω has exactly one point, f is trivially injective. So we need to consider this case separately. For the main argument, we will assume Ω has at least two distinct points, which implies f is non-constant.\n\n**Step 2: f is non-constant**\nSince f is injective on Ω, for any two distinct points z₁, z₂ ∈ Ω, we have f(z₁) ≠ f(z₂). This immediately implies f is not constant on Ω (unless Ω has at most one point, which we handled separately). Therefore, f is a non-constant analytic function on Ω.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Open Mapping Theorem**\nThe Open Mapping Theorem in complex analysis states: If g is a non-constant analytic function on a domain D, then g maps open subsets of D to open sets in ℂ. In particular, if we take D = Ω and g = f, then f(Ω) is an open subset of ℂ.\n\n**Step 4: f is bijective onto its image**\nSince f is injective by assumption, the restriction f: Ω → f(Ω) is a bijection. Therefore, the inverse function f^{-1}: f(Ω) → Ω exists.\n\n**Step 5: Analyticity of the inverse function**\nBy the analytic inverse function theorem (a consequence of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic functions), since f is analytic and injective on Ω, we have:\n1. f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω (this follows from injectivity and the fact that zeros of f' would imply local non-injectivity)\n2. The inverse function f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω)\n\nIn particular, since f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω), it is continuous on f(Ω).\n\n**Step 6: Openness of Ω via continuity argument**\nLet z₀ be an arbitrary point in Ω. We need to show that there exists ε > 0 such that the open ball B(z₀, ε) = {z ∈ ℂ: |z - z₀| < ε} is contained in Ω.\n\nConsider w₀ = f(z₀) ∈ f(Ω). Since f(Ω) is open (by Step 3), there exists δ > 0 such that the open ball B(w₀, δ) = {w ∈ ℂ: |w - w₀| < δ} is contained in f(Ω).\n\nNow consider the preimage of B(w₀, δ) under f^{-1}. Since f^{-1} is continuous (by Step 5), and B(w₀, δ) is open in f(Ω), the preimage f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω (with respect to the subspace topology on Ω).\n\nBut note that:\nf^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = {z ∈ Ω: f(z) ∈ B(w₀, δ)} = {z ∈ Ω: |f(z) - f(z₀)| < δ}\n\nSince f^{-1} is a bijection from f(Ω) to Ω, and w₀ = f(z₀), we have f^{-1}(w₀) = z₀. Therefore, z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)).\n\n**Step 7: Existence of an open neighborhood around z₀**\nSince f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω and contains z₀, there exists ε > 0 such that:\n{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω\n\nBut we need to show that this ε-neighborhood is actually an open ball in ℂ, not just in the subspace topology. Since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω, by definition of subspace topology, there exists an open set U ⊂ ℂ such that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = U ∩ Ω. Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), there exists ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ U. Then:\nB(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω ⊂ U ∩ Ω = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω\n\nHowever, we want to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. To see this, note that if there were a point z ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z ∉ Ω, then z would be in B(z₀, ε) but not in Ω, contradicting that B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω is an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. More formally, since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in the subspace topology of Ω, there exists ε > 0 such that:\n{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ))\n\nBut this set {z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} is exactly B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω. We need to show that actually B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. Suppose for contradiction that there exists z' ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z' ∉ Ω. Then consider the line segment from z₀ to z'. Since B(z₀, ε) is convex, the entire line segment is in B(z₀, ε). Let t₀ = sup{t ∈ [0,1]: z₀ + t(z' - z₀) ∈ Ω}. Since Ω contains z₀ and is not necessarily closed, the supremum t₀ might be less than 1. But this would create a boundary point of Ω in B(z₀, ε), which contradicts that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) contains an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. A cleaner argument: Since f is analytic on Ω, Ω must be open for f to be analytic at each point (analyticity requires an open neighborhood around each point). But this is circular. Instead, we can argue directly:\n\nSince f^{-1} is continuous at w₀, for the δ > 0 chosen above, there exists ε > 0 such that for all w ∈ f(Ω) with |w - w₀| < δ, we have |f^{-1}(w) - f^{-1}(w₀)| < ε. In particular, f^{-1} maps B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω) into B(z₀, ε). But since f is a bijection from Ω to f(Ω), we have f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). This shows that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), we have B(z₀, ε) contains points of Ω. But we need to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω.\n\nActually, a simpler approach: Since f^{-1} is analytic on the open set f(Ω), its domain f(Ω) is open, and the image of f^{-1} is Ω.
