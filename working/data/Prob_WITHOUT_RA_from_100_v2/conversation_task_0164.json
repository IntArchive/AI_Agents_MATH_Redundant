We can write `n` in its decimal expansion as:\n`n = a_k 10^k + a_{k-1} 10^{k-1} + \\dots + a_1 10^1 + a_0 10^0`\nwhere `a_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}` are the digits of `n`.\n\nThe sum of the digits of `n`, which we denote by `S`, is:\n`S = a_k + a_{k-1} + \\dots + a_1 + a_0`\n\nWe will use the properties of modular arithmetic. The core of the proof lies in the relationship between powers of 10 and the number 3.\nConsider the congruence of 10 modulo 3:\n`10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}`\n\nAccording to the properties of modular arithmetic, if `a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}`, then `a^i \\equiv b^i \\pmod{m}` for any non-negative integer `i`. Applying this, we get:\n`10^i \\equiv 1^i \\pmod{3}`\n`10^i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}` for all `i \\ge 0`.\n\nNow, let's consider the decimal expansion of `n` modulo 3:\n`n = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i 10^i \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i (1) \\pmod{3}`\n`n \\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i \\pmod{3}`\n\nThe sum on the right is the definition of `S`, the sum of the digits. Therefore, we have established the fundamental congruence:\n`n \\equiv S \\pmod{3}`\n\nThis means that `n` and `S` have the same remainder when divided by 3.
