By definition, the definite integral of f over [0,1] is:\\n\\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = lim_{n→∞} Σ_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) Δx_i\\n\\nwhere we partition [0,1] into n subintervals [x_{i-1}, x_i] with 0 = x₀ < x₁ < ... < x_n = 1, Δx_i = x_i - x_{i-1}, and x_i^* ∈ [x_{i-1}, x_i] is any sample point in the i-th subinterval. For a regular partition with equal subinterval lengths, we have Δx_i = 1/n for all i.\\n\\n**Step 2: Use properties of f to establish convergence**\\n\\nSince f is continuous on the closed interval [0,1], it is uniformly continuous by the Heine-Cantor theorem. This uniform continuity ensures that for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x,y ∈ [0,1] with |x-y| < δ, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < ε.\\n\\nFor the Riemann sum approximation, if we take partitions with mesh size max Δx_i < δ, then the difference between the Riemann sum and any other Riemann sum with the same partition but different sample points is bounded by ε. This establishes that the limit of Riemann sums exists and is independent of the choice of sample points, confirming that f is Riemann integrable on [0,1].\\n\\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\\n\\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1) states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a,b] (i.e., F'(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ [a,b]), then:\\n\\n∫_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\\n\\nWe apply this theorem with a = 0 and b = 1. Since f is continuous on [0,1] and F is an antiderivative of f on [0,1] by assumption, the theorem directly gives us:\\n\\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = F(1) - F(0)\\n\\n**Step 4: Evaluate F(1) - F(0) to obtain the definite integral value**\\n\\nLet F be the antiderivative of f. The evaluation F(1) - F(0) gives the exact value of the definite integral. For example:\\n\\n- If f(x) = x², then F(x) = x³/3 + C, and F(1) - F(0) = (1³/3 + C) - (0³/3 + C) = 1/3.\\n- If f(x) = e^x, then F(x) = e^x + C, and F(1) - F(0) = (e¹ + C) - (e⁰ + C) = e - 1.\\n- If f(x) = cos(x), then F(x) = sin(x) + C, and F(1) - F(0) = sin(1) - sin(0) = sin(1).\\n\\nIn each case, the constant C cancels out, giving a well-defined value for the definite integral.\\n\\n**Step 5: Verify that the evaluation interval [0,1] is properly accounted for**\\n\\nThe interval [0,1] is explicitly included in the notation ∫₀¹ f(x) dx. The lower limit of integration is 0 and the upper limit is 1. When we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we substitute these limits into the antiderivative:\\n\\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = [F(x)]₀¹ = F(x)|_{x=1} - F(x)|_{x=0} = F(1) - F(0)\\n\\nThe vertical bar notation with subscript 0 and superscript 1 clearly indicates evaluation at the endpoints of the interval. This notation ensures that the interval [0,1] is properly accounted for in the calculation.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nWe have shown that for any continuous function f: [0,1] → ℝ with antiderivative F on [0,1], the definite integral ∫₀¹ f(x) dx equals F(1) - F(0). The proof follows from the definition of the Riemann integral, properties of continuous functions on closed intervals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The evaluation at the endpoints of the interval [0,1] is properly accounted for in the notation F(1) - F(0).\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\n\nProblem:\nProve that The integral is evaluated over the interval $[0, 1]$.\nWe will prove that for any continuous function f: [0,1] → ℝ that has an antiderivative F on [0,1], the definite integral ∫₀¹ f(x) dx equals F(1) - F(0). The proof follows the five-step structure outlined in the proof sketch.\n\n**Step 1: Define the integral as a limit of Riemann sums**\n\nLet f: [0,1] → ℝ be continuous. By definition, the definite integral of f over [0,1] is:\n\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = lim_{n→∞} Σ_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) Δx_i\n\nwhere we partition [0,1] into n subintervals [x_{i-1}, x_i] with 0 = x₀ < x₁ < ... < x_n = 1, Δx_i = x_i - x_{i-1}, and x_i^* ∈ [x_{i-1}, x_i] is any sample point in the i-th subinterval. For a regular partition with equal subinterval lengths, we have Δx_i = 1/n for all i.\n\n**Step 2: Use properties of f to establish convergence**\n\nSince f is continuous on the closed interval [0,1], it is uniformly continuous by the Heine-Cantor theorem. This uniform continuity ensures that for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x,y ∈ [0,1] with |x-y| < δ, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < ε.\n\nFor the Riemann sum approximation, if we take partitions with mesh size max Δx_i < δ, then the difference between the Riemann sum and any other Riemann sum with the same partition but different sample points is bounded by ε. This establishes that the limit of Riemann sums exists and is independent of the choice of sample points, confirming that f is Riemann integrable on [0,1].\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1) states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f on [a,b] (i.e., F'(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ [a,b]), then:\n\n∫_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nWe apply this theorem with a = 0 and b = 1. Since f is continuous on [0,1] and F is an antiderivative of f on [0,1] by assumption, the theorem directly gives us:\n\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = F(1) - F(0)\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F(1) - F(0) to obtain the definite integral value**\n\nLet F be the antiderivative of f. The evaluation F(1) - F(0) gives the exact value of the definite integral. For example:\n\n- If f(x) = x², then F(x) = x³/3 + C, and F(1) - F(0) = (1³/3 + C) - (0³/3 + C) = 1/3.\n- If f(x) = e^x, then F(x) = e^x + C, and F(1) - F(0) = (e¹ + C) - (e⁰ + C) = e - 1.\n- If f(x) = cos(x), then F(x) = sin(x) + C, and F(1) - F(0) = sin(1) - sin(0) = sin(1).\n\nIn each case, the constant C cancels out, giving a well-defined value for the definite integral.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that the evaluation interval [0,1] is properly accounted for**\n\nThe interval [0,1] is explicitly included in the notation ∫₀¹ f(x) dx. The lower limit of integration is 0 and the upper limit is 1. When we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we substitute these limits into the antiderivative:\n\n∫₀¹ f(x) dx = [F(x)]₀¹ = F(x)|_{x=1} - F(x)|_{x=0} = F(1) - F(0)\n\nThe vertical bar notation with subscript 0 and superscript 1 clearly indicates evaluation at the endpoints of the interval. This notation ensures that the interval [0,1] is properly accounted for in the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have shown that for any continuous function f: [0,1] → ℝ with antiderivative F on [0,1], the definite integral ∫₀¹ f(x) dx equals F(1) - F(0).
