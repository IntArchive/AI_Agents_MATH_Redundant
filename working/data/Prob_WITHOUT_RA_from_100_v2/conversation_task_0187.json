However, for our immediate purpose, we don't need this theorem directly; we only need to construct the isomorphism.\\n\\nStep 1: Construction of the isomorphism\\nDefine a homomorphism φ: ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ → F as follows:\\nFor each b ∈ B, let e_b be the standard basis element of the direct sum ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ, which has 1 in the b-coordinate and 0 elsewhere.

Then f = φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b), so φ is surjective.\\n\\nStep 5: φ is injective\\nSuppose φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b) = 0. Then ∑_{b∈B} n_b b = 0 in F. By linear independence of B, all coefficients n_b must be 0. Hence ∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b = 0, so φ is injective.\\n\\nStep 6: φ is an isomorphism\\nSince φ is a bijective ℤ-module homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, F ≅ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ.\\n\\nStep 7: Uniqueness of rank\\nSuppose F is isomorphic to two direct sums: F ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ ≅ ⊕_{J} ℤ, where I and J are index sets.

This is well-defined and surjective since B generates F.\nStep 4) Show φ is injective: If φ(∑ n_b e_b) = 0, then ∑ n_b b = 0. By linear independence of B, all n_b = 0.\nStep 5) Thus φ is an isomorphism, proving F ≅ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ.\nStep 6) For uniqueness of rank: Suppose F ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ ≅ ⊕_{J} ℤ.

        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: ℤ is a PID\nAssumption 2: The module in question is an infinite direct product of copies of ℤ (∏_{ℕ} ℤ)\nProblem:\nProve that Free ℤ-modules are isomorphic to direct sums of copies of ℤ with uniquely defined ranks.\nLet F be a free ℤ-module. By definition, F has a basis B, which is a subset of F such that:\n1. B generates F (every element of F can be written as a finite ℤ-linear combination of elements of B)\n2. B is linearly independent over ℤ (if ∑_{b∈B} n_b b = 0 with n_b ∈ ℤ and only finitely many n_b nonzero, then all n_b = 0)\n\nSince ℤ is a PID (Principal Ideal Domain), we can use the following standard theorem from module theory: Over a PID, every submodule of a free module is free. However, for our immediate purpose, we don't need this theorem directly; we only need to construct the isomorphism.\n\nStep 1: Construction of the isomorphism\nDefine a homomorphism φ: ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ → F as follows:\nFor each b ∈ B, let e_b be the standard basis element of the direct sum ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ, which has 1 in the b-coordinate and 0 elsewhere. Define φ(e_b) = b.\nExtend φ ℤ-linearly: For any element ∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b ∈ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ (with only finitely many n_b nonzero), define φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b) = ∑_{b∈B} n_b b.\n\nStep 2: φ is well-defined\nSince any element of ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ has only finitely many nonzero coordinates, the sum ∑_{b∈B} n_b b is a finite sum in F, hence well-defined.\n\nStep 3: φ is a ℤ-module homomorphism\nFor any x = ∑ n_b e_b and y = ∑ m_b e_b in ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ and any r ∈ ℤ:\nφ(x + y) = φ(∑ (n_b + m_b) e_b) = ∑ (n_b + m_b) b = ∑ n_b b + ∑ m_b b = φ(x) + φ(y)\nφ(rx) = φ(∑ (rn_b) e_b) = ∑ (rn_b) b = r∑ n_b b = rφ(x)\n\nStep 4: φ is surjective\nSince B generates F, every element f ∈ F can be written as f = ∑_{b∈B} n_b b for some n_b ∈ ℤ (with only finitely many nonzero). Then f = φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b), so φ is surjective.\n\nStep 5: φ is injective\nSuppose φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b) = 0. Then ∑_{b∈B} n_b b = 0 in F. By linear independence of B, all coefficients n_b must be 0. Hence ∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b = 0, so φ is injective.\n\nStep 6: φ is an isomorphism\nSince φ is a bijective ℤ-module homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, F ≅ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ.\n\nStep 7: Uniqueness of rank\nSuppose F is isomorphic to two direct sums: F ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ ≅ ⊕_{J} ℤ, where I and J are index sets. We need to show |I| = |J|.\n\nConsider the quotient module F/2F, where 2F = {2f : f ∈ F}. Since 2ℤ is an ideal of ℤ, 2F is a submodule of F.\n\nUsing the isomorphisms:\nF/2F ≅ (⊕_{I} ℤ)/(⊕_{I} 2ℤ) ≅ ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ)\nSimilarly, F/2F ≅ ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ)\n\nNow, ℤ/2ℤ is a field (of characteristic 2), so ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ) and ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ) are vector spaces over ℤ/2ℤ.\n\nThe dimension of ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ) as a ℤ/2ℤ-vector space is |I| (the cardinality of I), since the images of the standard basis elements form a basis.\nSimilarly, the dimension of ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ) is |J|.\n\nSince these vector spaces are isomorphic (both isomorphic to F/2F), they have the same dimension. Therefore, |I| = |J|.\n\nStep 8: Conclusion\nWe have shown that any free ℤ-module F is isomorphic to a direct sum ⊕_{B} ℤ, where B is any basis of F, and the cardinality |B| (called the rank of F) is uniquely determined by F (independent of the choice of basis).\n\nNote: The assumption about ∏_{ℕ} ℤ (the infinite direct product of copies of ℤ) serves as an important example: while free ℤ-modules are direct sums of copies of ℤ, the module ∏_{ℕ} ℤ is NOT free over ℤ. This is known as the Baer-Specker group theorem. The existence of such non-free modules over ℤ (a PID) shows that not every ℤ-module is free, making the characterization of free modules particularly significant.",
