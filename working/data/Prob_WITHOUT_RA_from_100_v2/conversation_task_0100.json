Recall the definitions:\n\n**Definition (Free Action):** An action of a group $G$ on a space $X$ is called free if for every $x \\in X$ and every $g \\in G$, if $g \\cdot x = x$, then $g = e$ (where $e$ is the identity element of $G$).\n\n**Definition (Properly Discontinuous Action):** An action of a discrete group $G$ on a topological space $X$ is properly discontinuous if for every $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that for all $g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, we have $gU \\cap U = \\emptyset$. Equivalently, $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$ implies $g = e$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Assume the action is properly discontinuous.** By definition, for every $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that for all $g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, we have $gU_x \\cap U_x = \\emptyset$.\n\n2. **Take any $x \\in X$ and any $g \\in G$ such that $g \\cdot x = x$.** We need to show that $g = e$.\n\n3. **Apply the properly discontinuous condition to $x$.** Since the action is properly discontinuous, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ (we can take $U = U_x$ from step 1) with the property that for all $h \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, $hU \\cap U = \\emptyset$.\n\n4. **Analyze the condition $g \\cdot x = x$.** Since $x \\in U$ (as $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$) and $g \\cdot x = x$, we have:\n   - $x \\in U$ (by definition of neighborhood)\n   - $x = g \\cdot x \\in gU$ (since $g \\cdot x$ is the image of $x$ under the action of $g$, and $gU = \\{g \\cdot y : y \\in U\\}$)\n\n5. **Therefore, $x \\in gU \\cap U$.** This shows that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$, since it contains at least the point $x$.\n\n6. **Apply the property of $U$ from step 3.** The neighborhood $U$ has the property that for all $h \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, $hU \\cap U = \\emptyset$. Since we have established that $gU \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset$, the only possibility is that $g \\notin G \\setminus \\{e\\}$.\n\n7. **Conclude $g = e$.** If $g \\notin G \\setminus \\{e\\}$, then $g$ must be the identity element $e$.\n\n8. **General conclusion.** Since $x \\in X$ and $g \\in G$ with $g \\cdot x = x$ were arbitrary, we have shown that for all $x \\in X$ and all $g \\in G$, if $g \\cdot x = x$, then $g = e$. This is precisely the definition of a free action.\n\nThus, we have proved that a properly discontinuous action is necessarily free. The proof uses only the definition of properly discontinuous action and does not require the additional assumptions that $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff or that $G$ has the discrete topology (though these are typically part of the context for properly discontinuous actions).",
