    "Content":"I have heard that any submodule of a free module over a p.i.d. is free. I can prove this for finitely generated modules over a p.i.d.  But the proof involves induction on the number of generators, so it does not apply to modules that are not finitely generated. Does the result still hold?  What's the argument?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let $F$ be a free $R$ -module, where $R$ is a PID, and $U \\subseteq F$ be a submodule. Then $U$ is also free with $\\mathrm{rank}(U) \\leq \\mathrm{rank}(F)$ . Proof. Let $(e_i)_{i \\in I}$ be a basis of $F$ . Choose a well-ordering $\\leq$ on $I$ (this requires the Axiom of choice). Let $p_i : F \\to R$ be the projection on the $i$ th coordinate, i.e. $p_j(e_i) = \\delta_{ij}$ . Let $F_i$ be the submodule of $F$ generated by the $e_j$ with $j \\leq i$ . Let $U_i = U \\cap F_i$ . Then $p_i(U_i)$ is a submodule of $R$ , that is an ideal, i.e. has the form $R a_i$ for some $a_i \\in R$ . Choose some $u_i \\in U_i$ with $p_i(u_i)=a_i$ . If $a_i=0$ , we may, and will, choose $u_i=0$ . We claim that the $u_i \\neq 0$ constitute a basis of $U$ . We first show that $\\langle u_i : i \\in I \\rangle = U$ . Let $u \\in U$ , so $u \\in F$ and we can write $u = r_{i_1} e_{i_1} + \\cdots + r_{i_n} e_{i_n}$ with $i_1 < \\cdots < i_n$ . For $n=0$ there is nothing to do, so let $n \\geq 1$ . We make an induction on the largest index $j := i_n$ . We have $u \\in U_j$ and $r_j = p_j(u)  \\in p_j(U_j) = R a_j$ , say $r_j = s a_j = s p_j(u_j)$ for some $s \\in R$ . Then $p_j(u - s u_j) = 0$ , i.e. the $e_j$ -coefficient in $u - s u_j$ vanishes. By induction hypothesis, we know $u - s u_j \\in \\langle u_i : i \\in I \\rangle$ , hence also $u \\in \\langle u_i : i \\in I \\rangle$ . To show linear independence, we assume that $0 = r_{i_1} u_{i_1} + \\cdots + r_{i_n} u_{i_n} = 0 ~ (\\star)$ with $i_1 < \\cdots < i_n$ . Again consider the largest index $j := i_n$ . It suffices to prove $r_j=0$ , because then we are done by induction on $n$ . Applying $p_j$ to $(\\star)$ yields $0 = r_{i_1} 0 + \\cdots + r_{i_{n-1}} 0 + r_{j} a_j = r_j a_j$ . Since $a_j \\neq 0$ (otherwise, we would have $u_j = 0$ ), we conclude $r_j = 0$ . $\\checkmark$ -- PS: The same proof shows the more general result: If $R$ is a hereditary ring (every ideal of $R$ is projective over $R$ ), then any submodule of a free $R$ -module is a direct sum of ideals of $R$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether every submodule of a free module over a principal ideal domain (PID) is free, even when the module isn't finitely generated. I remember that for finitely generated modules, the result holds, but the proof uses induction on the number of generators, which obviously doesn't apply to non-finitely generated cases.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some module theory. Over a PID, a finitely generated free module has all its submodules free. But what about when the module isn't finitely generated? The key here might be that even infinitely generated free modules over PIDs have their submodules free. I think this is a standard result, but I need to verify the reasoning.\n\nThe structure theorem for modules over PIDs usually applies to finitely generated ones, so maybe that's not directly helpful. Instead, perhaps the property that in a PID, every submodule of a free module is free comes from the fact that PIDs are Noetherian? Wait, PIDs are Noetherian since every ideal is finitely generated, but that might not directly imply that submodules of free modules are free. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in a PID, every submodule of a free module is projective, and projective modules over PIDs are free. Wait, is that true? I think projective modules over PIDs are indeed free because all projective modules over a PID are free. So if a submodule is projective, then it's free. But why is a submodule of a free module over a PID projective?\n\nWait, in general, submodules of free modules are not necessarily projective unless the ring is hereditary. But PIDs are hereditary because all ideals are projective, and since PIDs have all ideals principal, hence free as modules (since in a domain, principal ideals are isomorphic to the ring itself). Therefore, PIDs are hereditary, which means that submodules of projective modules are projective. But a free module is projective, so its submodules are projective. But over a PID, projective modules are free. Hence, submodules of free modules are free. Therefore, even for non-finitely generated modules, this holds.\n\nBut wait, the original question mentions that the usual proof for finitely generated modules uses induction on the number of generators, which fails in the non-finitely generated case. So the alternative approach must use a different method, perhaps leveraging properties of PIDs and projective modules.\n\nSo the key steps would be:\n1. Over a PID, all projective modules are free.\n2. Submodules of free modules over a hereditary ring are projective.\n3. Since PIDs are hereditary, submodules of free modules are projective, hence free.\n\nTherefore, the result holds even without finite generation.\n\nAnother approach might be using the fact that in a PID, every submodule of a free module can be generated by a set of elements that can be extended to a basis, but I'm not sure how that works in the infinitely generated case. Maybe using Zorn's lemma to handle the infinite case?\n\nAlternatively, consider that in a free module over a PID, any submodule is also torsion-free, and torsion-free modules over PIDs are free. Wait, is that true? For finitely generated torsion-free modules over PIDs, they are free. But for infinitely generated ones? Hmm, I think torsion-free modules over PIDs are flat, but not necessarily free. So that approach might not work.\n\nBut earlier reasoning via hereditary rings and projective modules seems valid. Let me check again: a ring is hereditary if its global dimension is ≤1. For PIDs, the global dimension is 1, so they are hereditary. Hereditary rings have the property that submodules of projective modules are projective. Since free modules are projective, their submodules are projective, hence in a PID, projective modules are free, so the submodules are free.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be yes, even without finite generation. The key assumptions are that the ring is a PID (hence hereditary), and submodules of free modules are projective, hence free.",
