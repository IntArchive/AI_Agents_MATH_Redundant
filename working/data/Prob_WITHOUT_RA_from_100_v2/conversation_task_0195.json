More formally, any common divisor d of 2 and 2^n - 1 must divide any linear combination of them. In particular, d divides (2^n - 1) - 2·(2^{n-1} - 1) = 1.

But for d < n, we have 2^d - 1 < 2^n - 1 (since the function f(x) = 2^x - 1 is strictly increasing for x > 0). The only way a positive integer (2^n - 1) can divide a smaller positive integer (2^d - 1) is if 2^d - 1 = 0, which would imply d = 0, contradicting d being a positive integer. Therefore, no such d < n exists, and n is indeed the smallest positive integer with 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1).

        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $n$ is a positive integer\nAssumption 2: $2^n - 1$ is an integer greater than 1\nAssumption 3: The multiplicative order of 2 modulo $2^n - 1$ is defined\nProblem:\nProve that Euler's totient function $\\phi$ applies to $2^n - 1$\nWe will prove that n divides φ(2^n - 1) for any positive integer n with 2^n - 1 > 1.\n\n**Step 1: Show gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1**\nSince 2^n - 1 is odd for any positive integer n (as 2^n is even for n ≥ 1, so 2^n - 1 is odd), and 2 is even, the only common divisor could be 1. More formally, any common divisor d of 2 and 2^n - 1 must divide any linear combination of them. In particular, d divides (2^n - 1) - 2·(2^{n-1} - 1) = 1. Therefore, d = 1, establishing gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1.\n\n**Step 2: Define the multiplicative order**\nLet d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2^n - 1. By definition, d is the smallest positive integer such that 2^d ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). The existence of such d is guaranteed because gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1 from Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Prove d = n**\nFirst, note that 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1) because 2^n - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 2^n - 1), so 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). This shows that n is a positive integer satisfying 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1).\n\nNow we need to show that n is the smallest such positive integer. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a positive integer d < n such that 2^d ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). Then 2^n - 1 divides 2^d - 1. But for d < n, we have 2^d - 1 < 2^n - 1 (since the function f(x) = 2^x - 1 is strictly increasing for x > 0). The only way a positive integer (2^n - 1) can divide a smaller positive integer (2^d - 1) is if 2^d - 1 = 0, which would imply d = 0, contradicting d being a positive integer. Therefore, no such d < n exists, and n is indeed the smallest positive integer with 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). Hence, d = n.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Euler's theorem**\nSince gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1 (from Step 1), Euler's theorem applies, giving us:\n2^{φ(2^n - 1)} ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1)\nwhere φ is Euler's totient function.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the multiplicative order to φ(2^n - 1)**\nA fundamental property of multiplicative orders states that if a^k ≡ 1 (mod m) and d is the multiplicative order of a modulo m, then d divides k. Applying this with a = 2, m = 2^n - 1, and k = φ(2^n - 1), we have:\nSince 2^{φ(2^n - 1)} ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1) (from Step 4) and d = n is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2^n - 1 (from Step 3), it follows that n divides φ(2^n - 1).\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nTherefore, we have shown that n divides φ(2^n - 1) for any positive integer n with 2^n - 1 > 1. This completes the proof.\n\n**Remark:** The condition 2^n - 1 > 1 ensures we avoid the trivial case n = 1 where 2^1 - 1 = 1 and φ(1) = 1, and while 1 divides 1, the proof above requires 2^n - 1 to have a well-defined multiplicative order (which it does even for m = 1, but the statement is still true for n = 1).",
