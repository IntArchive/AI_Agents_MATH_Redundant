Then for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$:\\n   - $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ is well-defined.\\n   - Since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on $[a,b]$, their sum $h$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$ for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$.\\n   - Since $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, their sum $h' = f' + g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\\n   Therefore, $h = f + g \\\\in C^1([a,b])$.\\n\\n2. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any $f \\\\in C^1([a,b])$ and $\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, define $h = \\\\alpha f$.

Therefore, their suprema are also non-negative: $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| \\\\geq 0$ and $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\\\geq 0$. Hence, $\\\\lVert f \\\\rVert \\\\geq 0$.\\n   - If $\\\\lVert f \\\\rVert = 0$, then $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$. Since both terms are non-negative, this implies $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ and $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$.\\n   - $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ implies $|f(x)| = 0$ for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$.\\n   - $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$ implies $|f'(x)| = 0$ for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$, so $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\\\in [a,b]$.\\n   - Therefore, $f$ is the zero function. Conversely, if $f = \\\\mathbf{0}$, then $\\\\lVert f \\\\rVert = 0$.\\n\\n2. **Homogeneity**: For any $f \\\\in C^1([a,b])$ and $\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$:\\n   $$\\\\begin{aligned}\\n   \\\\lVert \\\\alpha f \\\\rVert &= \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |\\\\alpha f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |\\\\alpha f'(x)| \\\\\\\\\\n   &= \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |\\\\alpha| \\\\cdot |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |\\\\alpha| \\\\cdot |f'(x)| \\\\\\\\\\n   &= |\\\\alpha| \\\\cdot \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + |\\\\alpha| \\\\cdot \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\\\\\\\\\n   &= |\\\\alpha| \\\\left( \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n   &= |\\\\alpha| \\\\cdot \\\\lVert f \\\\rVert.\\n   \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n   The step $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |\\\\alpha f(x)| = |\\\\alpha| \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)|$ follows from the property of supremum: for any constant $c \\\\geq 0$, $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in S} c \\\\cdot g(x) = c \\\\cdot \\\\sup_{x \\\\in S} g(x)$.\\n\\n3. **Triangle inequality**: For any $f, g \\\\in C^1([a,b])$:\\n   $$\\\\begin{aligned}\\n   \\\\lVert f + g \\\\rVert &= \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x) + g(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x) + g'(x)| \\\\\\\\\\n   &\\\\leq \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} (|f'(x)| + |g'(x)|) \\\\quad \\\\text{(by triangle inequality for absolute value)} \\\\\\\\\\n   &\\\\leq \\\\left( \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g(x)| \\\\right) + \\\\left( \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n   &= \\\\left( \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\\\right) + \\\\left( \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\n   &= \\\\lVert f \\\\rVert + \\\\lVert g \\\\rVert.\\n   \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n   The inequality $\\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) \\\\leq \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g(x)|$ holds because for each $x$, $|f(x)| + |g(x)| \\\\leq \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\\\sup_{x \\\\in [a,b]} |g(x)|$, so the supremum of the left side cannot exceed the right side.\\n\\n**Conclusion**:\\nWe have shown that:\\n1. $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\\\\mathbb{R}$.\\n2.

This requires showing two main things: (1) $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, and (2) the $C^1$-norm satisfies all the properties of a norm.\n\n**Part 1: $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space**\n\nLet $C^1([a,b]) = \\{f: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R} \\mid f \\text{ is differentiable on } [a,b] \\text{ and } f' \\text{ is continuous on } [a,b]\\}$.\n\nWe verify the vector space axioms:\n\n1. **Closure under addition**: For any $f, g \\in C^1([a,b])$, define $h = f + g$. Then for all $x \\in [a,b]$:\n   - $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ is well-defined.\n   - Since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on $[a,b]$, their sum $h$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$.\n   - Since $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, their sum $h' = f' + g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\n   Therefore, $h = f + g \\in C^1([a,b])$.\n\n2. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any $f \\in C^1([a,b])$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$, define $h = \\alpha f$. Then for all $x \\in [a,b]$:\n   - $h(x) = \\alpha f(x)$ is well-defined.\n   - Since $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, $h$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $h'(x) = \\alpha f'(x)$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$.\n   - Since $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $h' = \\alpha f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.\n   Therefore, $h = \\alpha f \\in C^1([a,b])$.\n\n3. **Zero element**: The zero function $\\mathbf{0}: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $\\mathbf{0}(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$ is in $C^1([a,b])$ because:\n   - $\\mathbf{0}$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $\\mathbf{0}'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$.\n   - $\\mathbf{0}'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ (it's the constant zero function).\n\n4. **Other vector space properties**: The remaining vector space properties (associativity and commutativity of addition, distributivity of scalar multiplication, existence of additive inverses, etc.) follow from the fact that $C^1([a,b])$ is a subset of the vector space of all functions from $[a,b]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, and these properties are inherited.\n\nThus, $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Part 2: The $C^1$-norm is a valid norm**\n\nDefine the $C^1$-norm for $f \\in C^1([a,b])$ as:\n$$\\lVert f \\rVert = \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)|.$$\n\nWe verify the three norm axioms:\n\n1. **Non-negativity and definiteness**:\n   - For any $f \\in C^1([a,b])$, $|f(x)| \\geq 0$ and $|f'(x)| \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$. Therefore, their suprema are also non-negative: $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| \\geq 0$ and $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\geq 0$. Hence, $\\lVert f \\rVert \\geq 0$.\n   - If $\\lVert f \\rVert = 0$, then $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$. Since both terms are non-negative, this implies $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ and $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$.\n   - $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ implies $|f(x)| = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$.\n   - $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$ implies $|f'(x)| = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$, so $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [a,b]$.\n   - Therefore, $f$ is the zero function. Conversely, if $f = \\mathbf{0}$, then $\\lVert f \\rVert = 0$.\n\n2. **Homogeneity**: For any $f \\in C^1([a,b])$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n   \\lVert \\alpha f \\rVert &= \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |\\alpha f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |\\alpha f'(x)| \\\\\n   &= \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |\\alpha| \\cdot |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |\\alpha| \\cdot |f'(x)| \\\\\n   &= |\\alpha| \\cdot \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + |\\alpha| \\cdot \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\\\\n   &= |\\alpha| \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\right) \\\\\n   &= |\\alpha| \\cdot \\lVert f \\rVert.\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n   The step $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |\\alpha f(x)| = |\\alpha| \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)|$ follows from the property of supremum: for any constant $c \\geq 0$, $\\sup_{x \\in S} c \\cdot g(x) = c \\cdot \\sup_{x \\in S} g(x)$.\n\n3. **Triangle inequality**: For any $f, g \\in C^1([a,b])$:\n   $$\\begin{aligned}\n   \\lVert f + g \\rVert &= \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x) + g(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x) + g'(x)| \\\\\n   &\\leq \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} (|f'(x)| + |g'(x)|) \\quad \\text{(by triangle inequality for absolute value)} \\\\\n   &\\leq \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g(x)| \\right) + \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \\right) \\\\\n   &= \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\right) + \\left( \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \\right) \\\\\n   &= \\lVert f \\rVert + \\lVert g \\rVert.\n   \\end{aligned}$$\n   The inequality $\\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) \\leq \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g(x)|$ holds because for each $x$, $|f(x)| + |g(x)| \\leq \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |g(x)|$, so the supremum of the left side cannot exceed the right side.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nWe have shown that:\n1. $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2. The $C^1$-norm $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert$ satisfies all the properties of a norm: non-negativity, definiteness, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality.\n\nTherefore, $(C^1([a,b]), \\lVert \\cdot \\rVert)$ is a normed linear space.",
