    "Content":"I want to prove why $\\phi(n)$ is even for $n>3$. So far I am attempting to split this into 2 cases. Case 1: $n$ is a power of $2$. Hence $n=2^k$. So $\\phi(n)=2^k-2^{k-1}$. Clearly that will always be even. Case 2: $n$ is not a power of $2$. This is where I am unsure where to go. I figure I will end up using the fact that $\\phi(n)$ is multiplicative, and I think I'll get a $(p-1)$ somewhere in the resulting product which will make the whole thing positive, as $p$ is prime implies $(p-1)$ is even.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"You can do it via the formula as you do, but you can also simply use the definition that $\\phi(n)$ is the number of numbers $k$, with $1 \\le k \\le n$, such that $\\gcd(n, k) = 1$. Clearly, if $\\gcd(k, n) = 1$, then $\\gcd(n - k, n) = 1$ as well, so (for $n > 2$) all the numbers relatively prime to $n$ can be matched up into pairs $\\{k, n-k\\}$. So $\\phi(n)$ is even.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants to prove that Euler's totient function φ(n) is always even for n > 3. Let me start by recalling what the totient function is. Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of integers up to n that are coprime with n. So, we need to show that this count is even whenever n is greater than 3.\n\nThe user already split it into two cases: when n is a power of 2 and when it's not. For the first case, if n = 2^k, then φ(n) = 2^k - 2^(k-1) = 2^(k-1). For k ≥ 2 (since n > 3, so k ≥ 2), 2^(k-1) is even. That checks out.\n\nNow the second case where n is not a power of 2. The user mentioned using the multiplicative property of φ(n). Right, φ is multiplicative for coprime integers. So if n has prime factors other than 2, we can factorize n into its prime components. Let's say n has a prime factorization of 2^a * p^b * q^c... where p, q, etc., are odd primes.\n\nIf n is even but not a power of 2, then it has at least one odd prime factor. Let's take one such prime p. The φ(p^b) = p^b - p^(b-1) = p^(b-1)(p - 1). Since p is an odd prime, p - 1 is even, so φ(p^b) is even. Therefore, φ(n) would be φ(2^a) * φ(p^b) * ... which includes an even term, making the entire product even.\n\nBut what if n is odd? Then n has no factors of 2. So n is an odd number greater than 3, not a power of 2 (since all powers of 2 except 2^0 are even). So n must have at least one odd prime factor. Let's say the smallest prime factor is p (odd, ≥3). Then φ(p^b) = p^b - p^(b-1) = p^(b-1)(p - 1). Again, p - 1 is even, so φ(p^b) is even. Therefore, φ(n) would have this even factor, making the entire φ(n) even.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? Well, the problem states n > 3, so n=1 isn't considered. Also, n=2: φ(2)=1 which is odd, but n>3, so that's excluded. Similarly, n=3: φ(3)=2 which is even, but the problem says n>3. Wait, the original problem says φ(n) is even for n>3. But φ(3)=2 is even. So maybe the user's problem should actually state n>2, but the question as given says n>3. Hmm. Anyway, the user's problem is to prove for n>3, φ(n) is even.\n\nSo, putting this together: For n > 3, if n is a power of 2, then φ(n) = 2^(k-1), which is even for k ≥ 2 (since n=2^k >3 implies k≥3, so 2^(3-1)=4, even). If n is not a power of 2, then it has at least one odd prime factor. The totient function for that prime power contributes a factor of (p-1), which is even, hence φ(n) is even.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n1. If n is a power of 2, then φ(n) is even when n > 2 (since 2^2=4, φ(4)=2, which is even; for higher powers, φ(2^k)=2^(k-1), which is even).\n\n2. If n is not a power of 2, then it has an odd prime factor. The totient of that prime power includes (p-1), which is even. Hence φ(n) is even.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be approached by splitting into these cases, and in each case, showing that φ(n) must be even. The user's initial approach is correct, and the missing part is considering that any composite number not a power of 2 must have an odd prime factor, leading to an even φ(n).\n\nSo, structuring the problem as per the required format, the assumptions would be:\n\n- n is an integer greater than 3.\n\n- The problem is to prove that φ(n) is even.\n\nBut wait, the original question on Math Stack Exchange is \"Why is Euler's Totient function always even?\" with the user specifying n > 3. So the assumptions are that n > 3, and the problem is to prove φ(n) is even. However, in the example given, the assumption included specific conditions on n (like being divisible by 7). In this case, the only assumption is n > 3. But maybe the problem has more implicit assumptions? Let me check.\n\nThe original problem says \"for n > 3\". So the assumption is n is an integer greater than 3. The problem is to prove φ(n) is even. So the formatted problem should list the assumption that n is an integer greater than 3, and the problem is to prove φ(n) is even.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $n$ is an integer\nAssumption 2: $n > 2$\nProblem:\nProve that $n > 3$\nWe are asked to prove that if n is an integer and n > 2, then n > 3. To prove such an implication, we need to show that for every integer n satisfying the assumptions (n is an integer and n > 2), the conclusion (n > 3) must hold.\n\nLet us examine whether this statement is true by considering all integers n > 2:\n- n = 3: This satisfies both assumptions (3 is an integer and 3 > 2). However, the conclusion n > 3 would require 3 > 3, which is false since 3 = 3.\n- n = 4: This satisfies both assumptions (4 is an integer and 4 > 2) and also satisfies the conclusion (4 > 3).\n- n = 5: This satisfies both assumptions and the conclusion.\n- In fact, for all integers n ≥ 4, the conclusion holds.\n\nHowever, the existence of n = 3 as a counterexample is sufficient to show that the statement \"if n is an integer and n > 2, then n > 3\" is false. A single counterexample invalidates a universal statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given assumptions because it is not true. The assumptions are insufficient to guarantee the conclusion. To make the statement provable, we would need additional assumptions, such as n > 3 or n ≥ 4.\n\nIn summary:\n1. The statement to prove is: ∀n ∈ ℤ, (n > 2 → n > 3)\n2. We found n = 3 ∈ ℤ such that n > 2 is true but n > 3 is false\n3. This counterexample shows the universal statement is false\n4.
