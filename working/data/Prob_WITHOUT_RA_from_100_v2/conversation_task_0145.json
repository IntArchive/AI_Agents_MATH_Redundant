Prove that α + β and αβ are algebraic over F.\n\n### **Proof**\n\n**1. Definitions and Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Field Extension:** A field E is an extension of a field F if F is a subfield of E. We denote this by E/F.\n*   **Algebraic Element:** An element α ∈ E is **algebraic over F** if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in F. That is, there exists a polynomial `p(x) = c_n x^n + ... + c_1 x + c_0`, where `c_i ∈ F` and not all `c_i` are zero, such that `p(α) = 0`.\n*   **Field Adjunction:** `F(α)` denotes the smallest subfield of E that contains both F and α.\n*   **Degree of an Extension:** If E is a vector space over F, its dimension is called the degree of the extension, denoted `[E : F]`. The extension is finite if `[E : F]` is finite.\n*   **Key Theorem 1:** An element α ∈ E is algebraic over F if and only if the degree of the extension `F(α)/F` is finite, i.e., `[F(α) : F] < ∞`.\n*   **Key Theorem 2 (The Tower Law):** If F ⊆ K ⊆ E is a tower of field extensions, then `[E : F] = [E : K] * [K : F]`.\n\n**2. Proof Steps**\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing that the field `F(α, β)`, which contains `α + β` and `αβ`, is a finite extension of F.\n\n1.  **Finiteness of F(α)/F and F(β)/F:**\n    We are given that α is algebraic over F. By Key Theorem 1, this is equivalent to the statement that the field extension `F(α)/F` is finite.\n    `[F(α) : F] = n < ∞`\n\n2.  **β is Algebraic over F(α):**\n    We are given that β is algebraic over F. This means there exists a non-zero polynomial `p(x) ∈ F[x]` such that `p(β) = 0`. Since F is a subfield of `F(α)`, the coefficients of `p(x)` are also in `F(α)`. Therefore, `p(x)` can be considered a polynomial in `(F(α))[x]`, which means β is algebraic over the field `F(α)`.\n\n3.  **Finiteness of F(α, β)/F(α):**\n    Since β is algebraic over `F(α)`, applying Key Theorem 1 again, the extension `F(α)(β)/F(α)` must be finite. The field `F(α)(β)` is the same as `F(α, β)`, the smallest field containing F, α, and β.\n    `[F(α, β) : F(α)] = m < ∞`\n\n4.  **Finiteness of F(α, β)/F:**\n    We have a tower of fields `F ⊆ F(α) ⊆ F(α, β)`. Using the Tower Law (Key Theorem 2):\n    `[F(α, β) : F] = [F(α, β) : F(α)] * [F(α) : F] = m * n`\n    Since `m` and `n` are finite, their product `mn` is also finite. Thus, `F(α, β)` is a finite extension of F.\n\n5.  **α + β and αβ are Algebraic over F:**\n    The elements `α + β` and `αβ` are both contained in the field `F(α, β)`. This gives us two new towers of fields:\n    *   `F ⊆ F(α + β) ⊆ F(α, β)`\n    *   `F ⊆ F(αβ) ⊆ F(α, β)`\n\n    Applying the Tower Law to the first tower:\n    `[F(α, β) : F] = [F(α, β) : F(α + β)] * [F(α + β) : F]`\n    Since `[F(α, β) : F]` is finite, the degree `[F(α + β) : F]` must also be finite (as it must be a divisor of `[F(α, β) : F]`). By Key Theorem 1, since `[F(α + β) : F]` is finite, the element `α + β` is algebraic over F.\n\n    Similarly, for the second tower:\n    `[F(α, β) : F] = [F(α, β) : F(αβ)] * [F(αβ) : F]`\n    Since `[F(α, β) : F]` is finite, `[F(αβ) : F]` must also be finite. Therefore, the element `αβ` is algebraic over F.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that if α and β are algebraic over F, then the field extension `F(α, β)/F` is finite. Since `α + β` and `αβ` are elements of `F(α, β)`, the extensions `F(α + β)/F` and `F(αβ)/F` must also be finite. This proves that `α + β` and `αβ` are algebraic over F."
