            "text": "Now let me prove the new problem:\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. By Assumption 2, B = ∅ (empty set).\n2. By definition of function (Assumption 4), for every x ∈ dom F, there must exist exactly one y ∈ B such that (x, y) ∈ F.\n3. Since B = ∅, there are no elements y ∈ B.\n4. Therefore, for any x ∈ A (which is nonempty by Assumption 1), there cannot exist any y ∈ B such that (x, y) ∈ F.\n5. This means dom F must be empty for F to satisfy the function definition.\n6. But F ⊆ A × B (Assumption 3), and since B = ∅, A × B = ∅ (this follows from definition of Cartesian product, not needing it as an assumption).\n7. So F ⊆ ∅, meaning F = ∅.\n8. If F = ∅, then dom F = ∅.\n9. However, for F to be a function from A to B, we need dom F = A (since a function from A to B should have domain A).\n10. But A is nonempty (Assumption 1), so dom F = ∅ ≠ A.\n11. Therefore, there is no function F: A → B when A is nonempty and B = ∅.\n\n**Why this doesn't contradict the axiom of specification:**\nThe axiom of specification allows us to form subsets of a given set by specifying a property. It doesn't guarantee that such subsets will be functions from A to B. The issue here is not with set existence but with the definition of a function requiring that for each x ∈ A, there exists a unique y ∈ B. When B is empty, this condition cannot be satisfied for any x ∈ A, so no function exists. The axiom of specification is about set existence, not about function existence.\n\nNow I'll format the answer according to the JSON schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"Yes, the problem has a redundant assumption.\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\n    \"A is a nonempty set\",\n    \"B is the empty set\",\n    \"A function F: A → B is defined as a set of ordered pairs F ⊆ A × B\",\n    \"For every x ∈ dom F, there exists exactly one y ∈ B such that (x, y) ∈ F\"\n  ],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"A × B = ∅ when B = ∅\",\n  \"redundant_assumption_number\": 5,\n  \"new_problem\": \"New problem:\\nAssumptions:\\nAssumption 1: A is a nonempty set\\nAssumption 2: B is the empty set\\nAssumption 3: A function F: A → B is defined as a set of ordered pairs F ⊆ A × B\\nAssumption 4: For every x ∈ dom F, there exists exactly one y ∈ B such that (x, y) ∈ F\\nProblem:\\nProve that there is no function F: A → B when A is nonempty and B = ∅, and explain why this does not contradict the axiom of specification.\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"Proof: Since B = ∅, there are no elements y ∈ B.
