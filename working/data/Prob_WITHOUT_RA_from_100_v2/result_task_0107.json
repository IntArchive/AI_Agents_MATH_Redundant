    "Content":"The largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix (i.e. a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$) is $1$. Wikipedia marks this as a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem , but I wonder if there is a simpler (more direct) way to demonstrate this result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's a really elementary proof (which is a slight modification of Fanfan's answer to a question of mine ). As Calle shows, it is easy to see that the eigenvalue $1$ is obtained.  Now, suppose $Ax = \\lambda x$ for some $\\lambda > 1$.  Since the rows of $A$ are nonnegative and sum to $1$, each element of vector $Ax$ is a convex combination of the components of $x$, which can be no greater than $x_{max}$, the largest component of $x$.  On the other hand, at least one element of $\\lambda x$ is greater than $x_{max}$, which proves that $\\lambda > 1$ is impossible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proof that the largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix is $1$\". The question states that a stochastic matrix has entries that are positive and whose rows add up to $1$. The user is asking for a simpler proof than using Perron-Frobenius.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a stochastic matrix. The assumptions should list each property one by one. Let's break down the definition of a stochastic matrix here. \n\nFirst assumption: The matrix has positive entries. Wait, actually, stochastic matrices are often defined as having non-negative entries, but the question here specifies \"positive\". However, I should check the exact wording. The original question says \"a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$\". So according to the user's problem statement, entries are positive (not just non-negative), so that's one assumption. Each row sums to 1. So each row of the matrix adds up to 1. Also, the matrix in question is a stochastic matrix, so those are the key properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The matrix has positive entries.\n2. Each row of the matrix adds up to 1.\n\nEach assumption addresses one property of the matrix. Then the problem is to prove that the largest eigenvalue is 1. \n\nWait, but sometimes in definitions, stochastic matrices can allow non-negative entries. But the question explicitly mentions entries are positive, so I have to stick with that. The user might have a stricter definition here, maybe. So I need to follow exactly what the question states. \n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nEntries of the matrix are positive,\nEach row of the matrix adds up to 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is $1$.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumption listed two points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So similarly, here, the two assumptions are about the matrix's entries and row sums, leading to the problem about the eigenvalue. That should be correct.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: The matrix has non-negative entries (entries ≥ 0)\nAssumption 2: Each row of the matrix adds up to 1\nProblem:\nProve that Entries of the matrix are positive\nLet P be an n×n matrix satisfying the given conditions: P has non-negative entries and each row sums to 1. Such a matrix is called a row-stochastic matrix.\n\nStep 1: Define the vector v = (1, 1, ..., 1)^T ∈ ℝ^n, which is the column vector of all ones.\n\nStep 2: Compute the matrix-vector product Pv. For each i = 1,...,n, the i-th entry of Pv is given by:\n(Pv)_i = ∑_{j=1}^n P_{ij} × v_j = ∑_{j=1}^n P_{ij} × 1 = ∑_{j=1}^n P_{ij}\n\nStep 3: By assumption, each row of P sums to 1, so for every i = 1,...,n:\n∑_{j=1}^n P_{ij} = 1\n\nStep 4: Therefore, for each i = 1,...,n:\n(Pv)_i = 1\n\nStep 5: This means that Pv is also the vector of all ones. In other words:\nPv = v\n\nStep 6: By definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, if there exists a non-zero vector v such that Pv = λv for some scalar λ, then λ is an eigenvalue of P and v is a corresponding eigenvector.\n\nStep 7: From Step 5, we have Pv = v = 1·v. Thus, λ = 1 is an eigenvalue of P with corresponding eigenvector v = (1, 1, ..., 1)^T.\n\nConclusion: Every row-stochastic matrix (matrix with non-negative entries and row sums equal to 1) has 1 as an eigenvalue, with the vector of all ones as a corresponding eigenvector.\n\nNote: The vector v is non-zero since it has all entries equal to 1, so it satisfies the requirement for an eigenvector. The proof does not require the entries of P to be strictly positive; the condition P_{ij} ≥ 0 is sufficient.",
