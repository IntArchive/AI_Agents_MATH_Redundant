A larger L(α) means there exists a larger c such that infinitely many rational approximations p/q satisfy the inequality.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the approximation inequality**\nConsider the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²). For fixed c, this inequality gives a measure of approximation quality:\n- Smaller values of the right-hand side 1/(c q²) mean the approximation must be more accurate\n- Larger c makes 1/(c q²) smaller, requiring better approximations\n- Smaller c makes 1/(c q²) larger, allowing worse approximations\n\nThus, the inequality with larger c represents a stricter (higher quality) approximation requirement.\n\n**Step 3: Relating L(α) to approximation quality**\nIf L(α) is large, then for many large values of c, there exist infinitely many rational approximations p/q satisfying |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²). This means α has many high-quality approximations.\n\nConversely, if L(α) is small, then for most large values of c, the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has only finitely many solutions. This means α has relatively few high-quality approximations.\n\n**Step 4: Formal comparison of two numbers**\nLet α and β be irrational numbers with L(α) < L(β). Choose any c such that L(α) < c < L(β). By definition of supremum:\n1. Since c > L(α), the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has only finitely many rational solutions p/q.\n2. Since c < L(β), the inequality |β - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p/q.\n\nThis shows that for the approximation quality threshold 1/(c q²), β has infinitely many approximations while α has only finitely many.\n\n**Step 5: Extending to all approximation qualities**\nMore generally, for any approximation quality threshold ε > 0, we can consider the inequality |α - p/q| < ε/q². This is equivalent to |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) where c = 1/ε.\n\nIf L(α) < L(β), then for sufficiently small ε (equivalently, sufficiently large c = 1/ε with c > L(α)), α will have only finitely many approximations satisfying |α - p/q| < ε/q², while β will have infinitely many such approximations.\n\n**Step 6: Connecting to intuitive notion of 'more irrational'**\nThe intuitive concept of 'more irrational' means that a number is harder to approximate well by rational numbers. Our analysis shows:\n- When L(α) < L(β), there exists an approximation quality threshold such that β has infinitely many approximations at that quality while α has only finitely many\n- This means β admits better rational approximations than α\n- Equivalently, α is harder to approximate well by rationals than β\n- Therefore, α is 'more irrational' than β\n\n**Conclusion:** The definition that α is 'more irrational' than β if L(α) < L(β) precisely captures the intuitive notion that α is harder to approximate well by rational numbers than β. The Lagrange constant L(α) measures the supremum of constants c for which high-quality approximations exist, so a smaller Lagrange constant indicates poorer approximation properties, which corresponds to being 'more irrational'.",
