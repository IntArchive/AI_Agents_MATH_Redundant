This is a standard theorem in real analysis: if ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n x^n converges to f(x) for |x| < R, then f is infinitely differentiable on (-R, R) and f^{(k)}(x) = ∑_{n=k}^∞ n(n-1)...(n-k+1) a_n x^{n-k} for |x| < R.\n\n4. Applying this theorem, for any k ≥ 0 and for |x| < δ, we have:\n   f^{(k)}(x) = ∑_{n=k}^∞ n(n-1)...(n-k+1) a_n x^{n-k}.\n   This series is obtained by differentiating the original power series term-by-term k times.\n\n5. To find f^{(k)}(0), we evaluate the differentiated series at x = 0:\n   f^{(k)}(0) = ∑_{n=k}^∞ n(n-1)...(n-k+1) a_n (0)^{n-k}.\n   \n   For each term in this sum:\n   - When n > k, the factor (0)^{n-k} = 0, so the term vanishes.\n   - When n = k, we have: k(k-1)...(k-k+1) a_k (0)^{0} = k! a_k · 1 = k! a_k.\n   \n   Therefore, f^{(k)}(0) = k! a_k.\n\n6. Solving for a_k, we get: a_k = f^{(k)}(0)/k! for each k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n7. The Taylor series of f at 0 is by definition:\n   T_f(x) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ [f^{(k)}(0)/k!] x^k.\n   \n   Substituting a_k = f^{(k)}(0)/k! from step 6, we obtain:\n   T_f(x) = ∑_{k=0}^∞ a_k x^k.\n\n8. But ∑_{k=0}^∞ a_k x^k is exactly the given power series from Assumption 1 (just with index renamed from n to k).\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the Taylor series of f at 0 equals the given power series ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n x^n.\n\nQ.E.D.",

Since f is C^∞ on ℝ (Assumption 2), all derivatives f^{(k)}(0) exist for k = 0, 1, 2, ... This follows from the definition of C^∞ functions.\n\n2.
