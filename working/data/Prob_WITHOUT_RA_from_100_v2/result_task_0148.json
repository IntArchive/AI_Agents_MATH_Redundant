    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let $(B_k)_k$ be a sequence of iid Bernoulli distributed random variable with $P(B_k=1)=p$ for $k=1,2,\\dots$ Then $$X:=B_1+\\cdots+B_n$$ is binomially distributed with parameters $n,p$ and $$Y:=B_{n+1}+\\cdots+B_{n+m}$$ is binomially distributed with parameters $m,p$. It is evident that $X$ and $Y$ are independent. Now realize that $$X+Y=B_1+\\cdots+B_{n+m}$$ is binomially distributed with parameters $n+m,p$. This spares you any computations.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that the sum of two independent binomial variables X and Y with the same parameter p is also a binomial. Hmm, first, I need to recall the properties of binomial distributions. \n\nSo, a binomial random variable has parameters n (number of trials) and p (probability of success). If X ~ Bin(n, p) and Y ~ Bin(m, p), and they are independent, then the sum X + Y should be Bin(n + m, p). But wait, the question says \"same parameter p\". That makes sense because if the p's were different, the sum wouldn't be binomial. But the user didn't specify the number of trials for X and Y. Oh, right, the original problem must assume that X and Y have parameters (n, p) and (m, p), respectively. But the way the question is phrased might be missing that detail. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe original question says: \"the sum of two independent binomial variables X and Y with same parameter p\". It doesn't mention the number of trials. Wait, that's a problem. Because if X and Y have different numbers of trials, say n and m, then their sum is Bin(n + m, p) only if they have the same p. But if they have different p's, it's not binomial. However, the problem states \"same parameter p\", so the key here is that both X and Y share the same success probability p but might have different trial numbers n and m. \n\nBut the user's example in the problem statement didn't specify the trial numbers. So, when structuring the problem, I need to list the assumptions properly. Let me parse the original question again: \"sum of two independent binomial variables X and Y with same parameter p\". The term \"same parameter p\" could mean that both are binomial with parameters (n, p) and (m, p), i.e., same p but possibly different n and m. Alternatively, maybe they meant both parameters n and p are the same? But that's not necessarily required. \n\nWait, the standard result is that if X ~ Bin(n, p) and Y ~ Bin(m, p) are independent, then X + Y ~ Bin(n + m, p). So the key assumptions are that X and Y are independent, each is binomial, they have the same p, and possibly different n and m. However, the original question didn't mention the number of trials. So perhaps the problem is missing that X and Y have parameters (n, p) and (m, p). But in the question as given, the user might have omitted that detail. \n\nSo, to structure the problem correctly, the assumptions should include that X and Y are independent, each follows a binomial distribution with their own number of trials (say n for X and m for Y) but the same success probability p. Therefore, the problem is to prove that X + Y is also binomial with parameters (n + m, p). \n\nBut wait, the original question says \"same parameter p\". So the parameters here are n and p for X, and m and p for Y. So the same p, different n and m. The user might have thought that \"same parameter\" refers only to p, not n. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n1. X is a binomial random variable with parameters n and p.\n2. Y is a binomial random variable with parameters m and p.\n3. X and Y are independent.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that X + Y is a binomial random variable with parameters n + m and p.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7. However, in the problem at hand, there are multiple assumptions: X is binomial(n,p), Y is binomial(m,p), independence, same p. Each of these should be listed line by line in the assumptions section.\n\nSo, structuring it:\n\nAssumption:\nX follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p,\nY follows a binomial distribution with parameters m and p,\nX and Y are independent,\np is the same for both X and Y.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum X + Y is also a binomial variable.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example seems to have a mistake. The original example's assumption included that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. The user corrected it by adding that assumption. Wait, no, the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91, which is 7*13. So maybe the user assumed that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but the example only mentions 7. Hmm, that might be a different issue.\n\nIn any case, back to the current problem. The key assumptions are that X and Y are binomial with same p, independent, and possibly different n and m. Then their sum is binomial(n + m, p). However, if the original problem didn't specify that X and Y have the same p, but the user said \"same parameter p\", which could be ambiguous. But in the context of binomial distributions, the parameters are n and p. So \"same parameter p\" would mean that p is the same, but n can differ. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list each assumption separately:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a binomial random variable with parameters n and p,\nY is a binomial random variable with parameters m and p,\nX and Y are independent.\n\nProblem: Prove that the sum X + Y is a binomial random variable.\n\nWait, but the problem is to prove that the sum is binomial. The conclusion would be that X + Y ~ Bin(n + m, p). So the problem statement should specify that, but in the original question, it's just stated as \"is also a binomial\". Therefore, the problem is to prove that X + Y is a binomial variable with parameters n + m and p, given the assumptions.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have assumptions:\n\n- X ~ Bin(n, p)\n- Y ~ Bin(m, p)\n- X and Y are independent\n- p is the same for X and Y (but this is redundant because it's in their parameters)\n\nWait, no, since in the parameters of X and Y, if they both have p, then that's already covered. So the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption:\nX follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p,\nY follows a binomial distribution with parameters m and p,\nX and Y are independent.\n\nProblem: Prove that X + Y follows a binomial distribution.\n\nBut technically, the sum is binomial only if p is the same. If p were different, the sum wouldn't be binomial. So maybe the \"same parameter p\" is part of the problem statement. However, in the original question, it's stated as \"with same parameter p\", which likely refers to both X and Y having the same p. Therefore, the problem is structured with the assumptions that X and Y are binomial with the same p and independent, and then the problem is to prove their sum is binomial.\n\nBut actually, the sum of two binomials with same p is binomial only if they are independent. So the key assumptions are independence and same p. The numbers of trials can be different (n and m), and the sum will have n + m trials.\n\nSo, to structure this properly:\n\nAssumption:\nX is a binomial random variable with parameters n and p,\nY is a binomial random variable with parameters m and p,\nX and Y are independent.\n\nProblem: Prove that X + Y is a binomial random variable with parameters n + m and p.\n\nTherefore, the formatted answer would be:\n\nAssumption: \nX follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p,\nY follows a binomial distribution with parameters m and p,\nX and Y are independent.\nProblem: Prove that X + Y follows a binomial distribution with parameters n + m and p.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is on a separate line, addressing one property or condition applied to one object. The problem is clearly stated.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"The problem doesn't have redundant assumptions. Then we don't have new_problem\nWe aim to prove: An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n\nProof:\n\n1. **Definition of rational numbers**: A real number r is said to be rational if there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that r = p\/q.\n\n2. **Definition of irrational numbers**: By definition, a real number is irrational if it is not rational. That is, r is irrational if and only if r is not equal to p\/q for any integers p, q with q ≠ 0.\n\n3. **Logical equivalence**: The statement \"r is not rational\" is logically equivalent to \"r cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\" This follows directly from the definition:\n   - If r is rational, then by definition there exist integers p, q (q ≠ 0) such that r = p\/q.\n   - If r is not rational, then no such integers p, q exist.\n   - Therefore, \"r is irrational\" ⇔ \"r is not rational\" ⇔ \"r cannot be expressed as p\/q for any integers p, q with q ≠ 0.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since an irrational number is defined as a real number that is not rational, and \"not rational\" means \"cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers,\" we have proven that an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n\nThis completes the proof. Note that the proof relies only on the standard definitions of rational and irrational numbers and does not require any additional assumptions about odd\/even numbers or other properties.",
