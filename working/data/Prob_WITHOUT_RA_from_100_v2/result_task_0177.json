Thus at least one of $n_3$ or $n_2$ is $1$ So, G is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\\{54,56,60,72,80,84,88,90,96\\}$ $54=2.3^3$ No. of sylow 3 sbgroups, $1+3k$ divides $2$ Thus sylow 3 subgroup is normal and hence group is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\\{56,60,72,80,84,88,90,96\\}$ $\\textbf{EDIT}$ : Consider group $G$ of order $56$, for this we have $56=2^3.7$.\nAssuming this being simple group we would end up with the case that $n_2=7,n_7=8$.\n$n_p$ denotes no. of sylow p subgroups.\neach sylow $7$ subgroup has $6$ non identity elements, totally there are $8\\times 6=48$ non identity elements in all sylow $7$ subgroups.\\\neach sylow $2$ subgroup has $7$ non identity elements. As there is a possibility that intersection of two sylow $2$ subgroups to be non trivial, there would be one more (non identity) element different from these seven non identity elements, adding upto 8 non identity elements, with $1$ identity element and adding upto $1+8+48=57$ ($48$ elements from sylow $7$ subgroups) contradicting the cardinality of order of group $|G|=56$.\nThus, either $n_2=1$ or $n_7=1$.Thus, there exists a unique sylow $2$ subgroup or a unique sylow $7$ subgroup.Thus,$G$ is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\\{60,72,80,84,88,90,96\\}$ $80=2^4.5$ Possibilities for $n_2$ are $1,5$ possibilities for $n_5$ are $1,16$. Suppose \nSuppose $n_2=5$ and $n_5=16$, then $P_5$ contributes $64$ elements and atleast $16$ non identity elements from $P_2$ adding up to $80$ excluding identity. Thus G is not simple Only numbers we are left with are $\\{60,72,84,88,90,96\\}$ $84=2^2.3.7$ with out much difficulty, one can see $n_7=1$ and thus, G is not simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\\{60,72,88,90,96\\}$ $88=2^3.11$ with out much difficulty, one can see that $n_{11}=1$ thus G is simple. Only numbers we are left with are $\\{60,72,90,96\\}$ I somehow managed to show groups of order $72,90,96$ are not simple. (My hands are paining I can not write more than this :D) So, I am left with group of order $60$ and we have $A_5$ with $|A_5|=60$ and $G\\cong A_5$ I would be thankful if someone can check whether this is clear (or) not (even with any typos) and If possible give a hint for a simple way to arrive at required result. Thank You. P.S : To be frank, I have no idea how to solve this before writing this. I thought i would say at-least i know cyclic groups (prime order) are not simple and leave the rest to the other users and then I realized $p^2$ are not simple and so on tried eliminating one by one. at the time i came to the case of $72,90,96$ I got fed up ad blindly decided to assume they are simple (:P). I would write about that cases in a while in detail. P.S $2$ : Could any one please help me in concluding a group of order 24 being simple. I have edited a blunder in my argument. But could not able to proceed further.I am hoping for a proof which  use counting argument and no other results :)",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"By using some more powerful results, it is possible to do this a lot easier. The two main ingredients for this will be the following: Burnside's $pq$-Theorem: If only two distinct primes divide the order of $G$, then $G$ is solvable. Burnside's Transfer Theorem: If $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ and $P\\leq Z(N_G(P))$ then $G$ has a normal $p$-complement. So when looking for a non-abelian simple group, the first result immediately tells us that we can assume at least $3$ distinct primes divide the order of $G$. The way we will use the second result is the following: Let $P$ be a $p$-Sylow subgroup where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $|G|$. We will show that if $|P| = p$ then $P\\leq Z(N_G(P))$ (and then the above result says that $G$ is not simple). To see this, we note that $N_G(P)\/C_G(P)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\\rm{Aut}(P)$ (this is known as the N\/C-Theorem and is a nice exercise), which has order $p-1$, and since the order of $N_G(P)\/C_G(P)$ divides $|G|$, this means that $N_G(P) = C_G(P)$ and hence the claim (since we had picked $p$ to be the smallest prime divisor). The same argument actually shows that if $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $|G|$, then either $p^3$ divides $|G|$ or $p = 2$ and $12$ divides $|G|$. The reason for this is that if the $p$-Sylow is cyclic of order $p^2$ the precise same argument carries through, since in that case all prime divisors of $|\\rm{Aut}(P)|$ are $p$ or smaller. If $P$ is not cyclic then the order of $\\rm{Aut}(P)$ will be $(p^2-1)(p^2 - p) = (p+1)p(p-1)^2$ and the only case where this can have a prime divisor greater than $p$ is when $p = 2$ in which case that prime divisor is $3$, and we get the claim. In summary we get that the order of $G$ must be divisible by at least $3$ distinct primes, and either the smallest divides the order $3$ times, or the smallest prime divisor is $2$ (actually, by Feit-Thompson, we know this must be the case, but I preferred not to also invoke that), and $3$ must also divide the order. This immediately gives us $60$ as a lower bound on the order of $G$, and the next possible order would be $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7 = 84$ and all further orders are greater than $100$. So we are left with ruling out the order $84$ (which you have done), and showing that the only one of order $60$ is $A_5$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, I need to structure the problem from the given Math Stack Exchange question. Let me first read through the original problem carefully. The user is trying to prove that any non-abelian simple group of order less than 100 is isomorphic to A5. They went through a process of eliminating possible orders step by step, starting from primes, prime squares, prime powers, groups of order pq, p^2q, pqr, and so on, eventually narrowing down to orders like 60, 72, 90, 96, etc. They ended up with order 60, which is the order of A5, and concluded that G must be isomorphic to A5.\n\nThe task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from this. The example given shows that assumptions should list each condition line by line, applied to one object. The problem statement is the main question.\n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The user assumes G is a non-abelian simple group, and its order is less than 100. They also implicitly use properties like: if a group has prime order, it's cyclic (hence not simple if non-abelian?), prime squares are abelian, prime powers have non-trivial centers (so not simple), groups of order pq have normal Sylow subgroups, etc. But these are more like the reasoning steps rather than assumptions of the problem. The problem's actual assumptions are the given conditions on G.\n\nLooking at the original problem statement: \"Prove that : G is non abelian simple group of order <100 then G≅A5\". So the assumptions here are that G is a non-abelian simple group and |G| < 100. The problem is to show G is isomorphic to A5.\n\nWait, the user's own process involves eliminating orders, but the problem's assumptions are just that G is a non-abelian simple group with order less than 100. The elimination steps are part of the solution, not the problem's assumptions. So the problem's assumptions are:\n\n- G is a non-abelian group.\n- G is a simple group.\n- The order of G is less than 100.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to G. So the formatted problem should list these assumptions and the problem is to prove isomorphism to A5.\n\nBut in the example given, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem was to prove divisibility by 91 for every integer n. Wait, the example might have included more assumptions based on the user's process. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake? Because the original problem was for every integer n, so why add an assumption? Maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, but here the assistant needs to follow the correct process.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the example again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions: \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as an assumption; it's part of the proof. So perhaps the example is wrong. But the user says \"You will be given some example which I structured before,\" so maybe in their example, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but that's actually part of the problem's solution. Hmm, confusing.\n\nBut going back to the current problem. The problem is to prove that any non-abelian simple group of order less than 100 is isomorphic to A5. So the assumptions are:\n\n- G is a group.\n- G is non-abelian.\n- G is simple.\n- The order of G is less than 100.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption applied to G. So in the Assumption section, list each one on a separate line. The problem is to prove G ≅ A5.\n\nBut the original question's problem statement is: \"Prove that : G is non abelian simple group of order <100 then G≅A5\". So the user's problem is stated as a conditional: if G is a non-abelian simple group of order <100, then G is isomorphic to A5. Therefore, the assumptions are precisely those in the antecedent: G is non-abelian, simple, and |G| < 100. The problem is the consequent: proving the isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a non-abelian group,\nG is a simple group,\nThe order of G is less than 100.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is isomorphic to A5.\n\nBut let me check the user's example. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but that's incorrect because the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7 as a condition. However, the user's example might have a mistake. Since the user provided their own example, perhaps in their process, they considered an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but actually, in the problem statement, it's for all integers n. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but I should follow their structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the example was wrong. But regardless, for the current problem, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem statement. The original problem states \"G is a non abelian simple group of order <100\", so the assumptions are:\n\n- G is non-abelian,\n- G is simple,\n- The order of G is less than 100.\n\nTherefore, each of these is an assumption on G. The problem is to prove that G is isomorphic to A5.\n\nThe user's question is essentially asking for confirmation of their elimination process, but the formatted problem should capture the original problem's statement, not the user's solution steps. So the answer should structure the original problem as per the format, listing the assumptions and the problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nG is a non-abelian group,\nG is a simple group,\nThe order of G is less than 100.\n\nProblem:\nProve that G is isomorphic to A5.",
