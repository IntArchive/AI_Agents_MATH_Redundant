    "Content":"In the book 101 problems in Trigonometry , Prof. Titu Andreescu and Prof. Feng asks for the proof the fact that $\\cos 1^\\circ$ is irrational and he proves it. The proof proceeds by contradiction and using the strong induction principle. (Problem on Pg:84, 70 in typeset; solution on Pg:126, 111 in Typeset). However, for Completeness, I'll append it here: Proof of irrationality of $\\cos (1^\\circ)$ Assume for the sake of contradiction, that $\\cos(1^\\circ)$ is rational. Since, $$\\cos(2^\\circ)=2\\cos^2(1^\\circ)-1$$ we have that, $\\cos(2^\\circ)$ is also rational. Note that, we also have $$\\cos(n^\\circ +1 ^\\circ)+\\cos(n^\\circ -1 ^\\circ)=2\\cos(1^\\circ)\\cdot \n\\cos(n^\\circ)$$ By Strong induction principle, this shows that $\\cos(n^\\circ)$ is rational for all integers $n \\geq 1$. But, this is clearly false, as for instance, $\\cos(30^\\circ)=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is irrational, reaching a contradiction. But, as my title suggests, $\\sin(1^\\circ)$ is irrational, (look at the following image for its value!) Is there a proof as short as the above proof or can any of you help me with a proof that bypasses actual evaluation of the above value? Image Courtesy: http:\/\/www.efnet-math.org\/Meta\/sine1.htm This link explains how to evaluate this value. My next question is Is $\\tan(1^\\circ)$ rational and is there a short proof that asserts or refutes its rationality? P.S.: This is not a homework question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"$\\sin(1^\\circ) = \\cos(89^\\circ)$, and since 89 is relatively prime to 360, the proof for $\\cos 1^\\circ$ works with almost no change. More precisely: Assume that $\\cos(89^\\circ)$ is rational. Then, by the same induction as before with every $1^\\circ$ replaced by $89^\\circ$ we get that $\\cos(89n^\\circ)$ is rational for every $n\\in\\mathbb N$. In particular, since $150\\times 89=37\\times 360+30$, we get that $$\\cos(150\\times 89^\\circ)=\\cos(37\\times 360^\\circ+30^\\circ)=\\cos(30^\\circ)$$ is rational, a contradiction. For $\\tan(1^\\circ)$, a slight variant of the same proof works. Assume that $\\alpha = \\tan(1^\\circ)$ is rational. Then $1+\\alpha i$ is in $\\mathbb Q[i]$, and then $\\tan(n^\\circ)$, being the ratio between the imaginary and real parts of $(1+\\alpha i)^n$ is also rational. But $\\tan(30^\\circ)$ is not rational, so $\\tan(1^\\circ)$ cannot be either.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original question, the main problem is to prove that sin(1°) is irrational in a slick way, similar to the proof provided for cos(1°). Additionally, the user is asking about the rationality of tan(1°).\n\nThe example given shows that assumptions should list each property or condition applied to one object. In the example, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the original proof for cos(1°) uses the identity for cos(2°) and strong induction. For sin(1°), a similar approach might be possible. The key assumptions would relate to the trigonometric identities and induction steps. However, the question doesn't explicitly state assumptions but refers to the method used for cos(1°).\n\nWait, the problem statement in the example included the divisibility condition as an assumption. But in this case, the problem is to prove irrationality. The original proof for cos(1°) assumes it's rational and then uses induction. So, the assumption here would be that sin(1°) is rational, leading to all sin(n°) being rational, which contradicts sin(30°) or another known irrational value. Similarly for tan(1°). But the user is asking for the problem statement, not the proof steps.\n\nWait, the format requires the assumptions of the problem. The problem itself is to prove sin(1°) is irrational. The original question mentions the proof for cos(1°) uses the assumption that cos(1°) is rational, leading to a contradiction. So perhaps the assumption here is sin(1°) is rational, and then using induction via some identity to show all sin(n°) would be rational, leading to a contradiction. However, the problem statement as given doesn't specify these as assumptions but asks for a proof. The user wants the problem structured with assumptions and the problem. The example included the assumption from the problem (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). In this case, the problem is to prove sin(1°) is irrational, but the original proof for cos(1°) uses the assumption of rationality to derive a contradiction. So perhaps the assumptions for the problem would be the trigonometric identities and the induction principle, but the problem itself is to prove the irrationality. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical definitions, but the example included the divisibility as an assumption. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems to be a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that's incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\". The example might have a mistake. Wait, perhaps the user made an error in the example. Because the original problem says for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not part of the original problem. This could be a mistake in the example. Therefore, maybe the user intended that the formatted problem should include any conditions given in the problem. Wait, maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as an example. Therefore, I need to follow the structure as per the example, even if it's incorrect.\n\nBut in the given example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems wrong. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different version. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example problem: \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n (3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. That seems incorrect. Therefore, maybe the example has an error, but the user wants me to follow the format regardless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem had a typo and was supposed to have n divisible by 7, but the example is constructed that way. Regardless, the user's instruction is to follow the format as per the example. So, for the current problem, the task is to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking to prove that sin(1°) is irrational in a slick way, similar to the proof for cos(1°). The proof for cos(1°) assumes cos(1°) is rational, then shows via induction that all cos(n°) would be rational, leading to a contradiction with cos(30°). So, for the problem of proving sin(1°) is irrational, the analogous assumption would be that sin(1°) is rational. Then, using trigonometric identities to show that sin(n°) would be rational for all n, leading to a contradiction with, say, sin(30°) = 1\/2, but that's rational. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, sin(30°) is 1\/2, which is rational. So maybe another angle? Wait, the original contradiction for cos was with cos(30°) being sqrt(3)\/2. So for sin, maybe another angle where sin is irrational. For example, sin(45°) is sqrt(2)\/2, which is irrational. Or sin(60°) is sqrt(3)\/2. So, if assuming sin(1°) is rational, then via induction, sin(n°) would be rational, but sin(45°) is irrational, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption would be sin(1°) is rational.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions for the problem would be:\n\n- sin(1°) is rational.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to prove that sin(1°) is irrational. So the assumption leading to contradiction is part of the proof, but in the example, the assumption was part of the problem's conditions. Wait, no. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect unless the original problem had a mistake. But following the user's example, perhaps they intended to include the necessary conditions for the problem to hold. But if the problem is \"Prove that for every integer n...\", then the assumption should be \"n is an integer\". But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is not in the original problem. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction.\n\nTherefore, for the current problem:\n\nOriginal question asks to prove sin(1°) is irrational, similar to the proof for cos(1°). The proof by contradiction assumes cos(1°) is rational, then shows cos(n°) is rational for all n, contradicting cos(30°). Similarly, for sin(1°), the assumption would be sin(1°) is rational, leading to sin(n°) being rational for all n via some identity, but sin(30°) is 1\/2 (rational), which doesn't help. So maybe a different angle. For example, sin(45°) = sqrt(2)\/2 is irrational. Or perhaps sin(3°) is irrational, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using a different identity. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction comes from another angle. Alternatively, maybe using the identity for sin(a + b) to build up other angles.\n\nBut the problem statement is to structure the problem into assumptions and the problem. The assumptions would be those given in the problem. The original problem doesn't state any assumptions; it's just asking to prove sin(1°) is irrational. Therefore, perhaps the only assumption is that trigonometric identities hold, but that's too general. Alternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical framework. However, in the example, the user included assumptions from the problem's conditions. Since the original problem here is similar to the cos(1°) case, where the assumption in the proof is that cos(1°) is rational, but in the formatted problem, the example included conditions on n. So maybe for the current problem, the assumption is that sin(1°) is rational, which is the starting point for contradiction, but the problem is to prove that sin(1°) is irrational. However, in the example, the assumption was part of the problem's hypothesis, not the proof's assumption. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the example:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\n\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, this seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. Therefore, this example is flawed. However, the user provided it as an example, so I have to follow it even if it's incorrect. Therefore, in the current problem, even if the original question doesn't state explicit assumptions beyond the general mathematical context, I need to extract assumptions from the problem's context.\n\nBut the original question for sin(1°) doesn't state any assumptions, it just asks to prove it's irrational. The example from the user seems to take the problem's universal condition (\"for every integer n\") and list \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, then add another condition. But maybe in the example, the original problem had a typo, and the user corrected it in the formatted version. Alternatively, perhaps the example is incorrect, but we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to list the properties used in the proof as assumptions. For example, in the cos(1°) proof, the assumptions were the trigonometric identities and the induction principle. But in the formatted example, the assumptions are about n. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would be related to the method of proof, such as trigonometric identities and induction. But the example's assumptions were about the variable n, not the method.\n\nThis is confusing. Given the example, I think the user wants to list the conditions on the variables involved. For the sin(1°) problem, the variable is the angle 1°, and the function is sin. The problem is to prove sin(1°) is irrational. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical framework. However, in the example, the user included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, which are conditions on n. So for the current problem, since the angle is 1°, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, but the problem is to prove sin(1°) is irrational. However, the example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", the formatted version includes \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Therefore, perhaps for the current problem, the assumption is that 1° is an angle in standard trigonometric terms. But that's too trivial. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that trigonometric identities hold, but again, too general.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions needed, and the problem is simply as stated. However, the example includes assumptions even when the original problem doesn't explicitly state them. For instance, in the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is a universal statement, but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that 1° is an angle, which is implicitly given, but that's too obvious. Alternatively, maybe there's no assumption, and the problem is to prove the statement. But the example shows that assumptions are listed even if they're part of the problem's universal condition.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to list the minimal assumptions needed for the problem. For the sin(1°) problem, the only assumption is that we're working within the standard real numbers, but that's too basic. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is the angle addition formulas, but those are part of trigonometry, not assumptions. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is simply to prove sin(1°) is irrational. However, the example shows that even universal conditions are listed as assumptions. Therefore, perhaps the assumption here is that 1° is an angle (i.e., a real number in degrees), but that's trivial. Alternatively, if the proof uses induction, maybe the assumption is that the induction principle holds, but that's a mathematical method, not a problem assumption.\n\nGiven the example's approach, where the original problem says \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, perhaps similarly here, the assumption is that 1° is an angle, but that's redundant. Alternatively, since the proof for cos(1°) uses the identity for cos(2°), maybe the assumption is that the double-angle formula holds, but that's part of standard trigonometry.\n\nI think the user's example may have an error, but to adhere to the format, I'll proceed. Since the original problem asks to prove sin(1°) is irrational, and the example lists conditions on the variable (n being integer, divisible by 7), perhaps in this case, there are no specific assumptions other than the angle being 1°, but since the example includes conditions on the variable, maybe here there are no explicit assumptions, so the problem stands as is. However, the example includes assumptions even when they are part of the problem's universal statement, so perhaps for the current problem, the assumption is that we're dealing with angles in degrees, and trigonometric functions defined as usual. But that's too implicit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has no assumptions, and the formatted problem would have an empty assumption section. But the example didn't have that. Given the user's instruction to structure the problem with assumptions and problem, and the example shows assumptions even if they are part of the problem's universal condition, I'll proceed by listing any relevant assumptions from the problem's context.\n\nLooking at the original question, the user mentions the proof for cos(1°) uses strong induction and trigonometric identities. For sin(1°), perhaps a similar approach is used. The key assumption for contradiction is that sin(1°) is rational, leading to all sin(n°) being rational. However, that's part of the proof method, not the problem's assumptions. The problem's assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem statement. Since the problem is to prove sin(1°) is irrational, and there's no given condition other than the angle, perhaps there are no assumptions beyond the standard mathematical framework. But the example includes assumptions from the problem's universal quantifier.\n\nGiven the example's structure, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the assumptions used in the proof method as part of the problem's assumptions. But that's not standard. Alternatively, the problem's assumptions are the premises given in the problem. Since the problem is to prove a statement without given premises, perhaps the assumptions section is empty. However, the example shows that even universal conditions are listed as assumptions.\n\nGiven the user's example, I will list the following assumptions for the current problem:\n\nAssumption: Trigonometric identities hold for sine and multiple angles.\n\nBut that's part of general mathematics, not specific to the problem. Alternatively, if the proof uses induction, perhaps the assumption is that the principle of mathematical induction holds. But again, that's a method, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, since the original problem's proof for cos(1°) uses the identity cos(n+1) + cos(n-1) = 2 cos(1) cos(n), maybe the assumption here is that similar identities for sine hold. However, the problem is to structure the problem, not the proof.\n\nGiven the confusion and the example provided, perhaps the best way is to list the minimal assumptions that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the problem. Since the problem is about angles in degrees, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: 1° is an angle measure in degrees.\n\nBut that's trivial. Alternatively, there are no explicit assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty, but the example doesn't allow that. Since the example included assumptions even when they were part of the problem's universal statement, perhaps here we need to list something similar. For example, the problem involves trigonometric functions, so:\n\nAssumption: sine is defined for angles in degrees.\n\nBut that's still very basic. Alternatively, since the proof for cos(1°) uses the identity for cos(2°), maybe the assumption is that the double-angle formula holds. However, that's part of trigonometry's standard identities.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the intended assumptions are the conditions necessary for the problem to be posed. For the current problem, the necessary condition is that we're considering the sine of 1 degree. Therefore:\n\nAssumption: The angle 1° is considered.\n\nBut that's redundant. Alternatively, the problem might not have explicit assumptions, and the user's example was incorrect. But since I need to follow the example, I'll proceed.\n\nWait, the user's example took the original problem which was to prove for every integer n, and formatted it with assumptions n is an integer, n divisible by 7. That seems to add an extra condition. Perhaps the user intended to include both the universal condition (n is integer) and any additional conditions. But in the original problem, there was no n divisible by 7. This suggests a mistake in the example. However, given that, maybe the user wants to extract conditions from the problem statement. In the current problem, the only condition is that the angle is 1°, so perhaps:\n\nAssumption: The angle is 1°.\n\nProblem: Prove that sin(1°) is irrational.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, given that the original proof for cos(1°) uses induction and identities, the assumptions could be the trigonometric identities required, but that's part of the proof, not the problem.\n\nGiven the confusion and the flawed example, I'll proceed to list the problem as per the user's instruction, extracting any assumptions from the problem statement. Since the problem statement doesn't provide explicit assumptions beyond the general mathematical context, but the example includes assumptions even when they're part of the universal statement, I'll list the following:\n\nAssumption: Trigonometric functions are defined for angles in degrees.\n\nProblem: Prove that sin(1°) is irrational.\n\nAdditionally, the user also asks about tan(1°), so perhaps:\n\nAssumption: \nTrigonometric functions are defined for angles in degrees,\nThe angle 1° is considered.\n\nProblem: \nProve that sin(1°) is irrational and determine whether tan(1°) is rational.\n\nBut the example has each assumption as one line per property or condition applied to one object. So, each assumption is a separate line. The problem mentions both sin and tan, but the main problem is about sin(1°), and the secondary question is about tan(1°). So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe angle 1° is considered in standard trigonometric terms.\n\nProblem:\nProve that sin(1°) is irrational. Additionally, determine whether tan(1°) is rational.\n\nBut the example had assumptions listed as separate points. However, the original problem doesn't state any assumptions, so perhaps the assumptions section is left blank, but the example shows that even universal conditions are listed. Given the user's example, I think they expect to list any conditions or properties that the problem relies on, even if they're implicit. Since the problem is about proving irrationality, and the proof method would involve assuming rationality and deriving a contradiction, but that's part of the proof, not the problem's assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, following the user's example despite its potential flaw, the formatted problem for the given question would be:\n\nAssumption: \nThe angle 1° is considered.\n\nProblem: \nProve that $\\sin(1^\\circ)$ is irrational. Additionally, determine whether $\\tan(1^\\circ)$ is rational.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption was about the variable n. Here, since the angle is fixed at 1°, there's no variable. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions needed, but the example forces us to list something. Alternatively, given that the example included assumptions that were part of the problem's statement (n is an integer), even if redundant, perhaps here the assumption is that 1° is an angle, which is redundant, but necessary per the example's format.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should list the assumption as the angle being 1°, and the problem as proving the irrationality of sin(1°) and determining the rationality of tan(1°).",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\n\nProblem:\nProve that The angle $1^\\circ$ is considered in standard trigonometric terms.\nWe prove that the angle $1^\\circ$ is considered in standard trigonometric terms by following the six-step proof sketch:\n\n**Step 1: Definition of 'Standard Trigonometric Terms'**\n\nIn standard trigonometry, an angle is considered valid if it can be measured in either degrees or radians and fits within the framework of either:\n1. The unit circle definition: For any angle $\\theta$, there exists a unique point $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$ on the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n2. The right triangle definition: For an acute angle $\\theta$ in a right triangle, the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) are defined as ratios of side lengths.\n3. The coordinate geometry definition: Angles are measured from the positive x-axis in the Cartesian plane.\n\n**Step 2: $1^\\circ$ as a Valid Angle Measurement in the Degree System**\n\nThe degree system is one of the two standard systems for measuring angles in trigonometry (the other being radians). By definition:\n- A full circle is divided into 360 equal parts, each called a degree ($1^\\circ$).\n- Therefore, $1^\\circ = \\frac{1}{360}$ of a full rotation.\n- Since the degree system is a standard trigonometric measurement system, any integer or fractional number of degrees is a valid angle measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Conversion to Radians**\n\nThe radian system is the other standard system for angle measurement. The conversion between degrees and radians is given by:\n$$180^\\circ = \\pi \\text{ radians}$$\nTherefore:\n$$1^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\text{ radians}$$\nThis shows that $1^\\circ$ has an exact representation in the radian system as $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radians.\n\n**Step 4: Placement on the Unit Circle**\n\nFor any angle $\\theta$ measured in standard position (counterclockwise from the positive x-axis), there exists a unique point on the unit circle given by $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$. Specifically:\n- For $\\theta = 1^\\circ$, the corresponding point is $(\\cos 1^\\circ, \\sin 1^\\circ)$.\n- Since $0^\\circ \\leq 1^\\circ < 360^\\circ$, it falls within the standard range for angles on the unit circle.\n- The coordinates can be computed (approximately) as:\n  $$\\cos 1^\\circ \\approx 0.9998477$$\n  $$\\sin 1^\\circ \\approx 0.0174524$$\n  These satisfy $\\cos^2 1^\\circ + \\sin^2 1^\\circ = 1$, confirming the point lies on the unit circle.\n\n**Step 5: Definition of Trigonometric Functions for $1^\\circ$**\n\nAll standard trigonometric functions can be defined for $1^\\circ$:\n\n1. **Using the unit circle definition:**\n   $$\\sin 1^\\circ = y\\text{-coordinate of the point at angle }1^\\circ$$\n   $$\\cos 1^\\circ = x\\text{-coordinate of the point at angle }1^\\circ$$\n   $$\\tan 1^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 1^\\circ}{\\cos 1^\\circ}$$\n\n2. **Using the right triangle definition:**\n   For a right triangle with an acute angle of $1^\\circ$:\n   $$\\sin 1^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$$\n   $$\\cos 1^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$$\n   $$\\tan 1^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}}$$\n\n3. **Using series expansions:**\n   $$\\sin 1^\\circ = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{180} - \\frac{(\\pi\/180)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(\\pi\/180)^5}{5!} - \\cdots$$\n   $$\\cos 1^\\circ = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{(\\pi\/180)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(\\pi\/180)^4}{4!} - \\cdots$$\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nSince $1^\\circ$:\n1. Is a valid measurement in the degree system (one of the two standard trigonometric systems),\n2. Has an exact representation in the radian system as $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radians,\n3. Can be placed on the unit circle with coordinates $(\\cos 1^\\circ, \\sin 1^\\circ)$,\n4. Has well-defined trigonometric functions through multiple equivalent definitions,\n\nwe conclude that $1^\\circ$ is indeed considered in standard trigonometric terms.\n\n**Additional Verification:**\n\n- $1^\\circ$ appears in trigonometric tables and is used in practical applications (navigation, engineering, etc.).\n- Trigonometric identities hold for $1^\\circ$, e.g., $\\sin^2 1^\\circ + \\cos^2 1^\\circ = 1$.\n- The angle $1^\\circ$ can be constructed geometrically using compass and straightedge (though not exactly, but to arbitrary precision).\n\nTherefore, the proof is complete: $1^\\circ$ satisfies all criteria for being a valid angle in standard trigonometry.",
