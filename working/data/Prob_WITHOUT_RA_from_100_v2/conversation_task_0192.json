That is, for any two distinct edges e₁, e₂ ∈ E, we have w(e₁) ≠ w(e₂).\\n\\n2. **Assume for contradiction:** Suppose G has two different minimum spanning trees T₁ and T₂. Since T₁ ≠ T₂, there exists at least one edge that is in T₁ but not in T₂, and vice versa.\\n\\n3. **Consider the symmetric difference:** Let S = (T₁ \\\\ T₂) ∪ (T₂ \\\\ T₁) be the set of edges that are in exactly one of T₁ or T₂. Since T₁ and T₂ are different, S is non-empty.\\n\\n4. **Choose edge e:** Let e be an edge in S with minimum weight among all edges in S. Without loss of generality, assume e ∈ T₁ \\\\ T₂ (if e ∈ T₂ \\\\ T₁, we can swap the roles of T₁ and T₂ in the argument).\\n\\n5. **Add e to T₂:** Consider adding edge e to T₂. Since T₂ is a spanning tree (and thus contains exactly |V| - 1 edges), adding e creates a unique cycle C in T₂ ∪ {e}. This cycle must contain e because T₂ itself is acyclic.\\n\\n6. **Existence of edge f:** Since e ∉ T₂, the cycle C must contain at least one edge f ≠ e that is in T₂ but not in T₁. Here's why:\\n   - All edges in C except e are in T₂.\\n   - If every edge in C (other than e) were also in T₁, then T₁ would contain the cycle C, contradicting that T₁ is a tree (acyclic).\\n   - Therefore, there exists at least one edge f ∈ C, f ≠ e, such that f ∈ T₂ but f ∉ T₁.\\n\\n7. **Weight comparison:** Since all edge weights are distinct, we have either w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f).\\n\\n8. **Case 1: w(e) < w(f):**\\n   Consider the spanning tree T₂' obtained from T₂ by removing edge f and adding edge e. Formally, T₂' = (T₂ \\\\ {f}) ∪ {e}.\\n   - T₂' is still a spanning tree: Removing f breaks the cycle C, and adding e reconnects the graph without creating cycles.\\n   - The weight of T₂' is w(T₂') = w(T₂) - w(f) + w(e).\\n   - Since w(e) < w(f), we have w(T₂') < w(T₂).\\n   - This contradicts the assumption that T₂ is a minimum spanning tree (which should have minimum possible weight among all spanning trees).\\n\\n9. **Case 2: w(e) > w(f):**\\n   In this case, note that f ∈ T₂ \\\\ T₁ and w(f) < w(e). Since e was chosen as the minimum weight edge in S, and f ∈ S (because f ∈ T₂ \\\\ T₁), we must have w(f) ≥ w(e) (by definition of e as the minimum weight edge in S). This contradicts w(f) < w(e).\\n   \\n   Alternatively, we can apply a symmetric argument: Consider adding f to T₁. Since f ∉ T₁, adding f to T₁ creates a cycle C' in T₁ ∪ {f}. This cycle must contain an edge e' ≠ f that is in T₁ but not in T₂. Since w(f) < w(e) and e was the minimum weight edge in S, we have w(f) < w(e'). Then replacing e' with f in T₁ would give a spanning tree with weight less than T₁, contradicting that T₁ is an MST.\\n\\n10. **Conclusion:** In both possible cases (w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f)), we reach a contradiction.

Since T₁ ≠ T₂, there exists at least one edge that is in T₁ but not in T₂, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Consider the symmetric difference:** Let S = (T₁ \\ T₂) ∪ (T₂ \\ T₁) be the set of edges that are in exactly one of T₁ or T₂. Since T₁ and T₂ are different, S is non-empty.\n\n4. **Choose edge e:** Let e be an edge in S with minimum weight among all edges in S. Without loss of generality, assume e ∈ T₁ \\ T₂ (if e ∈ T₂ \\ T₁, we can swap the roles of T₁ and T₂ in the argument).\n\n5. **Add e to T₂:** Consider adding edge e to T₂. Since T₂ is a spanning tree (and thus contains exactly |V| - 1 edges), adding e creates a unique cycle C in T₂ ∪ {e}. This cycle must contain e because T₂ itself is acyclic.\n\n6. **Existence of edge f:** Since e ∉ T₂, the cycle C must contain at least one edge f ≠ e that is in T₂ but not in T₁. Here's why:\n   - All edges in C except e are in T₂.\n   - If every edge in C (other than e) were also in T₁, then T₁ would contain the cycle C, contradicting that T₁ is a tree (acyclic).\n   - Therefore, there exists at least one edge f ∈ C, f ≠ e, such that f ∈ T₂ but f ∉ T₁.\n\n7. **Weight comparison:** Since all edge weights are distinct, we have either w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f).\n\n8. **Case 1: w(e) < w(f):**\n   Consider the spanning tree T₂' obtained from T₂ by removing edge f and adding edge e. Formally, T₂' = (T₂ \\ {f}) ∪ {e}.\n   - T₂' is still a spanning tree: Removing f breaks the cycle C, and adding e reconnects the graph without creating cycles.\n   - The weight of T₂' is w(T₂') = w(T₂) - w(f) + w(e).\n   - Since w(e) < w(f), we have w(T₂') < w(T₂).\n   - This contradicts the assumption that T₂ is a minimum spanning tree (which should have minimum possible weight among all spanning trees).\n\n9. **Case 2: w(e) > w(f):**\n   In this case, note that f ∈ T₂ \\ T₁ and w(f) < w(e). Since e was chosen as the minimum weight edge in S, and f ∈ S (because f ∈ T₂ \\ T₁), we must have w(f) ≥ w(e) (by definition of e as the minimum weight edge in S). This contradicts w(f) < w(e).\n   \n   Alternatively, we can apply a symmetric argument: Consider adding f to T₁. Since f ∉ T₁, adding f to T₁ creates a cycle C' in T₁ ∪ {f}. This cycle must contain an edge e' ≠ f that is in T₁ but not in T₂. Since w(f) < w(e) and e was the minimum weight edge in S, we have w(f) < w(e'). Then replacing e' with f in T₁ would give a spanning tree with weight less than T₁, contradicting that T₁ is an MST.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** In both possible cases (w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f)), we reach a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exist two different minimum spanning trees T₁ and T₂ must be false. Hence, the minimum spanning tree of G is unique.\n\n**Q.E.D.**",
