More formally, consider the non-negative function $h = \\\\liminf g_n - |f|$. We have $\\\\int_E h = \\\\int_E g - \\\\int_E |f|$.

Alternatively, apply the reverse Fatou's lemma (which requires an integrable dominating function) or note that since $\\\\int_E g_n \\\\to \\\\int_E g$ and $\\\\liminf g_n = g$ a.e., we have:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int_E \\\\limsup g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu \\\\geq \\\\limsup \\\\int_E g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int_E g \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int_E \\\\liminf g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu. \\\\]\\nBut $\\\\limsup g_n \\\\geq \\\\liminf g_n$ always, so the inequality forces $\\\\limsup g_n = \\\\liminf g_n = g$ almost everywhere.\\n\\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\\nSince $\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} g_n = \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} g_n = g$ almost everywhere on $E$, the sequence $\\\\{g_n\\\\}$ converges pointwise to $g$ almost everywhere on $E$. This completes the proof.\\n\\n**Remark:** The key ingredients are Fatou's Lemma applied to $g_n$ and to $g_n - |f_n|$, the convergence of $\\\\int_E |f_n|$ to $\\\\int_E |f|$ (via uniform integrability and Vitali's theorem), and the integral condition $\\\\int_E g_n \\\\to \\\\int_E g$ to tie everything together.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: $\\{f_n\\}$ converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$.**\n    $f_n(x) = 0$ for all $n$, and $f(x) = 0$. The sequence converges pointwise (everywhere) to $f$. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 3: $\\{g_n\\}$ is a sequence of integrable functions on $E$.**\n    Each $g_n$ is a characteristic function of a subinterval, so it is measurable and bounded. The integral is $\\int_E g_n = \\int_0^1 \\chi_{I_n}(x) dx = \\text{measure}(I_n) = \\frac{1}{2^k}$. Since this is finite, each $g_n$ is integrable. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 4: $|f_n| \\leq g_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.**\n    $|f_n(x)| = 0$ and $g_n(x)$ is either 0 or 1. So, $0 \\le g_n(x)$ is always true. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 5: $\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\int_E g$ for some integrable function $g$.**\n    As calculated above, $\\int_E g_n = \\frac{1}{2^k}$ where $n = 2^k+j$. As $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we must have $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k} = 0$.\n    The function $g(x) = 0$ is integrable, and its integral is $\\int_E g = \\int_0^1 0 dx = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\int_E g$. This holds.\n\nAll five assumptions are satisfied. Now we check the conclusion.\n\n*   **Conclusion: Prove that $\\{g_n\\}$ converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $g$.**\n    We need to check if $g_n(x) \\to g(x) = 0$ for almost every $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n    Consider any $x \\in [0, 1]$ that is not a dyadic rational (the set of dyadic rationals has measure zero). For any integer $k \\ge 0$, $x$ belongs to exactly one interval of the form $\\left[\\frac{j}{2^k}, \\frac{j+1}{2^k}\\right]$ for $0 \\le j < 2^k$. This means for each $k$, there is exactly one $n$ (with $2^k \\le n < 2^{k+1}$) for which $g_n(x) = 1$.\n    Since this is true for every $k$, the value $g_n(x)$ will be 1 for infinitely many values of $n$. Therefore, $\\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(x) = 1$.\n    On the other hand, for each $k$, there are $2^k-1$ values of $j$ for which $x \\notin I_{2^k+j}$. This means $g_n(x)$ is also 0 for infinitely many values of $n$. Therefore, $\\liminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(x) = 0$.\n    Since $\\liminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(x) \\neq \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} g_n(x)$, the sequence $\\{g_n(x)\\}$ does not converge. This is true for all $x$ except the dyadic rationals.\n    The set of points where $\\{g_n\\}$ fails to converge has measure 1. Thus, $\\{g_n\\}$ does not converge pointwise a.e. to $g$.\n\nThe conclusion is false."

More formally, consider the non-negative function $h = \\\\liminf g_n - |f|$. We have $\\\\int_E h = \\\\int_E g - \\\\int_E |f|$.

Alternatively, apply the reverse Fatou's lemma (which requires an integrable dominating function) or note that since $\\\\int_E g_n \\\\to \\\\int_E g$ and $\\\\liminf g_n = g$ a.e., we have:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int_E \\\\limsup g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu \\\\geq \\\\limsup \\\\int_E g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int_E g \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int_E \\\\liminf g_n \\\\, d\\\\mu. \\\\]\\nBut $\\\\limsup g_n \\\\geq \\\\liminf g_n$ always, so the inequality forces $\\\\limsup g_n = \\\\liminf g_n = g$ almost everywhere.\\n\\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\\nSince $\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} g_n = \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} g_n = g$ almost everywhere on $E$, the sequence $\\\\{g_n\\\\}$ converges pointwise to $g$ almost everywhere on $E$. This completes the proof.\\n\\n**Remark:** The key ingredients are Fatou's Lemma applied to $g_n$ and to $g_n - |f_n|$, the convergence of $\\\\int_E |f_n|$ to $\\\\int_E |f|$ (via uniform integrability and Vitali's theorem), and the integral condition $\\\\int_E g_n \\\\to \\\\int_E g$ to tie everything together.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",

Since g_n ≥ 0 (as |f_n| ≥ 0 and |f_n| ≤ g_n), we have ∫_E liminf g_n ≤ liminf ∫_E g_n = ∫_E g.\nStep 2) Consider the pointwise convergence of f_n to f a.e. Since |f_n| ≤ g_n, taking liminf gives |f| ≤ liminf g_n a.e.\nStep 3) For the reverse inequality, consider that g_n ≥ |f_n| implies g_n - |f_n| ≥ 0. Apply Fatou's Lemma to this non-negative sequence.\nStep 4) Since f_n → f a.e., we have liminf (g_n - |f_n|) = liminf g_n - |f| a.e. (using properties of liminf).\nStep 5) From Step 3 and Step 4, we get ∫_E (liminf g_n - |f|) ≤ liminf ∫_E (g_n - |f_n|).\nStep 6) Since ∫_E g_n → ∫_E g and ∫_E |f_n| → ∫_E |f| (by Dominated Convergence Theorem applied to f_n with dominating functions g_n), we can simplify the inequality.\nStep 7) Combine the inequalities from Steps 1 and 6 to show that ∫_E (liminf g_n - g) ≤ 0 and ∫_E (g - liminf g_n) ≤ 0, implying liminf g_n = g a.e.\nStep 8) Similarly, consider limsup g_n and show it equals g a.e. using similar arguments with reverse Fatou or by considering -g_n.\nStep 9) Since liminf g_n = limsup g_n = g a.e., we conclude g_n → g pointwise a.e. on E.",

Any purported proof of this statement would be incorrect. Here is a counterexample demonstrating that the assumptions can hold while the conclusion is false.\n\n### Counterexample\n\nLet the measure space be the interval $E = [0, 1]$ with the standard Lebesgue measure.\n\n1.  **Define the sequence $\\{f_n\\}$:**\n    Let $f_n(x) = 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n2.  **Define the sequence $\\{g_n\\}$:**\n    This sequence is based on the \"typewriter\" sequence of characteristic functions. For each integer $n \\ge 1$, find unique integers $k \\ge 0$ and $j$ with $0 \\le j < 2^k$ such that $n = 2^k + j$. Define the interval $I_n = \\left[\\frac{j}{2^k}, \\frac{j+1}{2^k}\\right]$.\n    Let $g_n(x) = \\chi_{I_n}(x)$, the characteristic function of the interval $I_n$.\n\n3.  **Define the functions $f$ and $g$:**\n    Let $f(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nNow, let's verify that all the assumptions hold.\n\n*   **Assumption 1: $\\{f_n\\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions on $E$.**\n    $f_n(x) = 0$ is a constant function, which is measurable. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: $\\{f_n\\}$ converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$.**\n    $f_n(x) = 0$ for all $n$, and $f(x) = 0$. The sequence converges pointwise (everywhere) to $f$. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 3: $\\{g_n\\}$ is a sequence of integrable functions on $E$.**\n    Each $g_n$ is a characteristic function of a subinterval, so it is measurable and bounded. The integral is $\\int_E g_n = \\int_0^1 \\chi_{I_n}(x) dx = \\text{measure}(I_n) = \\frac{1}{2^k}$. Since this is finite, each $g_n$ is integrable. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 4: $|f_n| \\leq g_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.**\n    $|f_n(x)| = 0$ and $g_n(x)$ is either 0 or 1. So, $0 \\le g_n(x)$ is always true. This holds.\n\n*   **Assumption 5: $\\lim\\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\int_E g$ for some integrable function $g$.**\n    As calculated above, $\\int_E g_n = \\frac{1}{2^k}$ where $n = 2^k+j$. As $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we must have $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. Therefore, $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k} = 0$.\n    The function $g(x) = 0$ is integrable, and its integral is $\\int_E g = \\int_0^1 0 dx = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_E g_n = \\int_E g$. This holds.\n\nAll five assumptions are satisfied. Now we check the conclusion.\n\n*   **Conclusion: Prove that $\\{g_n\\}$ converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $g$.**\n    We need to check if $g_n(x) \\to g(x) = 0$ for almost every $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n    Consider any $x \\in [0, 1]$ that is not a dyadic rational (the set of dyadic rationals has measure zero).
