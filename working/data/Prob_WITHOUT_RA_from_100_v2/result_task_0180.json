    "AcceptedAnswer":"The short answer is no, in that you almost certainly have to perform separate checks \"one prime at a time.\"  For that matter, there's no really slick of doing the quadratic case, either.  You either have to do some grunt work with mod-4 conditions on coefficients of minimal polynomials, etc., or build up the theory of the different, etc., and start hitting problems with bigger hammers.  When you get past the quadratic case, the grunt work becomes increasingly tedious (\/impossible), and you're only left with hammers.  So you need technical lemmas on how to conclude that a subring of a ring of integers is really the whole thing, and I don't think it's possible to do that without considering the various primes which could possibly divide the index.  Keith Conrad's notes that Álvaro mentions give one solution (his Lemma 1) -- here's another slightly different approach.  At the very least, it avoids working explicitly with local rings, even if it doesn't avoid the fact that philosophically we're working locally anyway. Let $\\mathcal{O}$ be the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})$.  We have $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]\\subset\\mathcal{O}$, and we wish to show equality.  It suffices to show that for each prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$, we have $\\mathcal{O}=\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]+\\mathfrak{p}$ (this is basically using Nakayama's Lemma to disguise a collection of local things to check with a collection of global things to check).  Since for $\\alpha:=\\sqrt[3]{2}$, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ is $f_\\alpha(x)=x^3-2$, we also know that \n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\subset \\tfrac{1}{f'(\\alpha)}\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]=\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{4}}\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}],\n$$\nmaking it trivial to check the desired equality for everything but $p=2$ and $p=3$.  Now (this part is basically the same as in Keith Conrad's notes) we observe that it suffices to demonstrate $p$-Eisenstein polynomials $h_p(x)$ for a generator $x_p\\in\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ for $p=2$ and $p=3$.  But these are easy to come by:  For $p=2$, take $x_2=\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and $h_2(x)=f_\\alpha(x)$ and for $p=3$, take $x_3=\\sqrt[3]{2}+1$ and $h_3(x)=f_\\alpha(x-1)$.  Ta-da.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that ℤ[³√2] is the ring of integers of ℚ[³√2]. Hmm, rings of integers... Right, the ring of integers of a number field is the integral closure of ℤ in that field. So, in this case, we need to prove that every algebraic integer in ℚ[³√2] is already in ℤ[³√2].\n\nFirst, I remember that for some extensions, especially those generated by roots, the ring of integers is straightforward, but sometimes it's more complicated. For example, ℤ[√d] is the ring of integers of ℚ(√d) when d is square-free and congruent to 2 or 3 mod 4. But here, it's a cube root, so the situation is different.\n\nThe user mentions that the standard proof involves localizing at different primes and showing it's a DVR (Discrete Valuation Ring). That does sound complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach using minimal polynomials or discriminant calculations?\n\nLet me recall that if α is an algebraic integer of degree n, and the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of α is equal to the discriminant of the number field, then ℤ[α] is the ring of integers. So perhaps compute the discriminant of ℤ[³√2] and compare it to the discriminant of the field ℚ[³√2].\n\nThe element α = ³√2 has minimal polynomial x³ - 2. The discriminant of this polynomial is -27*(2)² = -108. Wait, discriminant formula for cubic x³ + ax + b is -4a³ - 27b². Here, a=0 and b=-2, so discriminant is -4*(0)³ -27*(-2)² = -27*4 = -108. So disc(ℤ[α]) is (-108), but actually, the discriminant of the ring ℤ[α] is the discriminant of the basis {1, α, α²}.\n\nBut the discriminant of the number field K=ℚ(³√2) should be the discriminant of its ring of integers. If ℤ[α] is indeed the ring of integers, then disc(ℤ[α]) should equal the discriminant of K. However, if there's an element in the ring of integers not in ℤ[α], then the discriminant of the ring of integers would divide disc(ℤ[α]), and be a square factor. But ℤ[α] has discriminant -108, which factors as -2²*3³. Wait, the discriminant of the number field is supposed to be the discriminant of an integral basis. So if ℤ[α] is not the full ring of integers, then its discriminant would be larger in absolute value. But maybe here, since 108 is square-free except for 4 and 27. Wait, 108=4*27=4*3³. The square factors here are 4 and 9. But the discriminant of the field must be square-free? No, not necessarily. Wait, in quadratic fields, the discriminant is square-free except for the factor related to the field, but in higher degrees, it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that if the index [O_K : ℤ[α]] is 1, then O_K = ℤ[α]. To compute this index, we can use the formula that disc(ℤ[α]) = [O_K : ℤ[α]]² * disc(O_K). So if disc(ℤ[α]) is equal to disc(O_K), then the index is 1, hence O_K = ℤ[α].\n\nSo if we can compute the discriminant of the field K=ℚ(³√2), which is supposed to be -108, then ℤ[³√2] is the ring of integers. But how do we know that the discriminant of the field is indeed -108? That requires knowing the integral basis. Alternatively, if we can show that ℤ[³√2] is integrally closed, then it is the ring of integers.\n\nTo check if ℤ[³√2] is integrally closed, suppose there exists an algebraic integer in K not in ℤ[³√2]. Let β be such an element. Then β can be written as (a + b³√2 + c³√4)\/d where a,b,c,d are integers with d>1 and gcd(a,b,c,d)=1. Then we need to show that such an element cannot exist. Suppose it does, then its minimal polynomial would have coefficients in ℤ. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider the prime ideals. Maybe check that ℤ[³√2] is Dedekind, i.e., it's Noetherian, integrally closed, and every non-zero prime ideal is maximal. Since ℤ[³√2] is a quotient of ℤ[x], which is Noetherian, so it's Noetherian. To check integrally closed. Alternatively, since ℚ[³√2] has degree 3, and ℤ[³√2] has discriminant -108. If -108 is square-free in some sense (which it's not; 108=2²*3³), but maybe the only primes that ramify are 2 and 3. Then, check if ℤ[³√2] is maximal at all primes. That is, for primes p not dividing the discriminant, the ring is maximal at p. For primes dividing the discriminant, check if it's maximal.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that if the polynomial x³ - 2 is Eisenstein at 2, hence ℤ[³√2] is the ring of integers. Wait, Eisenstein's criterion gives that the extension is totally ramified at 2. But does that help? Maybe not directly.\n\nAnother approach: Compute the possible elements of the ring of integers. Suppose β = (a + b³√2 + c³√4)\/k where a, b, c, k are integers, k > 1, and gcd(a, b, c, k) = 1. Then, β must satisfy a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. Let’s write down the minimal polynomial for β and see if the coefficients can be integers unless k=1.\n\nLet’s suppose β = (a + b³√2 + c³√4)\/k. Let’s compute its minimal polynomial. Let α = ³√2, so α³=2. Then β = (a + bα + cα²)\/k. The minimal polynomial of β over ℚ is going to be degree 3, unless β is in a lower degree extension. But since K=ℚ(α) has degree 3, minimal polynomial is degree 3. Let’s denote the minimal polynomial as x³ + px² + qx + r. Then expanding (x - β)(x - β')(x - β'') where β', β'' are the conjugates of β. Since the conjugates would involve α multiplied by cube roots of unity, but since α is real, the other conjugates are complex. Wait, but ℚ(α) is not a Galois extension because the minimal polynomial x³ - 2 doesn't split into linear factors. So the embeddings of K into ℂ are three: one real (sending α to real cube root of 2), and two complex ones. So when we compute the coefficients of the minimal polynomial, they must be rational.\n\nIf β is integral, then the coefficients p, q, r must be integers. Let’s compute the trace, norm, etc. But this might get messy. Alternatively, assume that k is a prime. Suppose k divides 2 or 3, since the discriminant involves 2 and 3. Suppose there exists an algebraic integer β = (a + bα + cα²)\/k with k=2 or 3. Let's try k=2 first. Suppose β = (a + bα + cα²)\/2. Then, multiplying by 2: 2β = a + bα + cα². Then, 2β is an algebraic integer. But since α is an algebraic integer, then a + bα + cα² must be in ℤ[α]. So 2β is in ℤ[α], so β is in (1\/2)ℤ[α]. But for β to be integral, the minimal polynomial must have integer coefficients. Let’s compute the minimal polynomial. Let’s set γ = a + bα + cα². Then γ ∈ ℤ[α], and 2β = γ. The minimal polynomial of β is (2x - γ)(2x - γ')(2x - γ'') \/ 8 = 0. Expanding this would require coefficients to be integers. But this might not be possible unless certain conditions on a, b, c, k hold.\n\nAlternatively, use the trace. The trace of β should be an integer. Trace of β is β + β' + β''. If β = (a + bα + cα²)\/k, then Tr(β) = (3a)\/k + (b Tr(α) + c Tr(α²))\/k. Since α has minimal polynomial x³ - 2, Tr(α) = 0 (sum of roots: 0 coefficient for x²). Similarly, Tr(α²). The minimal polynomial for α² is x³ - 4, since (α²)^3 = 4. Wait, no. Let me compute the minimal polynomial of α². Let’s compute (α²)^3 = (α³)^2 = 2² = 4. So the minimal polynomial is x³ - 4, so the trace of α² is 0 as well. Hence, Tr(β) = 3a \/ k. Since β is integral, Tr(β) must be integer. So 3a\/k is integer. Since k divides 3a. If k=2, then 3a must be divisible by 2, so 2 divides 3a. Since gcd(2,3)=1, 2 divides a. Let a=2a'. Then Tr(β)= 3*(2a')\/2= 3a', which is integer. So possible.\n\nSimilarly, consider the norm. The norm of β is the product of β, β', β''. If β = (a + bα + cα²)\/k, then norm is (a + bα + cα²)(a + bα' + c(α')²)(a + bα'' + c(α'')²)\/k³. This should be integer. But since γ = a + bα + cα² is in ℤ[α], its norm is integer. Therefore, the norm of β is norm(γ)\/k³. Since β is integral, norm(β) must be integer. So norm(γ) must be divisible by k³. So norm(γ) ≡ 0 mod k³. Let’s take k=2. Then norm(γ) ≡ 0 mod 8. Compute norm(γ) for γ = a + bα + cα². The norm is the product of the conjugates. Since α³=2, we can compute norm(γ) = (a + bα + cα²)(a + bωα + cω²α²)(a + bω²α + cωα²), where ω is a primitive cube root of unity. This product is complicated, but perhaps expand it modulo 2. If we take a, b, c even or odd, maybe the norm modulo 8 can be analyzed.\n\nAlternatively, take specific values. Suppose k=2. Let’s assume that a, b, c are integers not all even. Let’s pick a=1, b=0, c=0. Then γ=1, norm=1, which is 1 mod 8. Not divisible by 8. So β=1\/2 would have norm 1\/8, not integer. Hence, not integral. So such β is not integral. Similarly, if a=1, b=1, c=0, then γ=1 + α. Compute its norm. (1 + α)(1 + ωα)(1 + ω²α). Let’s compute:\n\nFirst, (1 + α)(1 + ωα)(1 + ω²α) = product over conjugates. Let me compute this. Let’s denote ωα and ω²α as the other roots. Then expanding:\n\n(1 + α)(1 + ωα)(1 + ω²α) = [(1 + α)(1 + ωα + ω²α + ω³α²)]. Wait, maybe better to multiply step by step.\n\nFirst multiply (1 + α)(1 + ωα) = 1 + ωα + α + ωα² = 1 + α(1 + ω) + ωα².\n\nThen multiply by (1 + ω²α):\n\n= [1 + α(1 + ω) + ωα²] * (1 + ω²α)\n\n= 1*(1 + ω²α) + α(1 + ω)*(1 + ω²α) + ωα²*(1 + ω²α)\n\n= 1 + ω²α + α(1 + ω + ω²α + ω³α²) + ωα² + ω³α³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³α³ = α³ = 2. Also, note that 1 + ω + ω² = 0.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe use logarithmic terms or another approach. Alternatively, recall that the norm of 1 + α is the product of 1 + α, 1 + ωα, 1 + ω²α. Let’s let x = α, then the norm is (1 + x)(1 + ωx)(1 + ω²x). Let’s expand this:\n\n= (1 + x)(1 + ωx + ω²x + ω³x²)\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so:\n\n= (1 + x)(1 + (ω + ω²)x + x²)\n\nSince ω + ω² = -1, this becomes:\n\n= (1 + x)(1 - x + x²)\n\n= 1*(1 - x + x²) + x*(1 - x + x²)\n\n= 1 - x + x² + x - x² + x³\n\nSimplify: 1 + x³ = 1 + 2 = 3. So norm(1 + α) = 3. Then norm(β) = 3 \/ 8. Not an integer, so β = (1 + α)\/2 is not integral. Hence, no such element with k=2.\n\nSimilarly, try k=3. Suppose β = (a + bα + cα²)\/3. Then Tr(β) = 3a \/3 = a, which must be integer. So a is integer. Norm of β is norm(γ)\/27. So norm(γ) must be divisible by 27. Take γ = a + bα + cα². What's norm(γ)? For example, take γ = 1. Norm is 1, which is not divisible by 27. So β=1\/3 has norm 1\/27, not integer. If γ = α, norm(α)=2, so norm(β)=2\/27. Not integer. If γ=α², norm=4, so norm(β)=4\/27. Not integer. If γ=1+α+α², norm is N(1+α+α²). Let's compute that. Similar to before:\n\nN(1 + α + α²) = (1 + α + α²)(1 + ωα + (ωα)²)(1 + ω²α + (ω²α)²)\n\nThis seems complex. Alternatively, use the minimal polynomial. Let’s find the minimal polynomial of 1 + α + α². Let’s set y = 1 + α + α². Then, α³ = 2, so α = 2^(1\/3). Express y in terms of α. Then y = 1 + α + α². Let's find a relation. Let's compute y - 1 = α + α². Multiply both sides by α: (y -1)α = α² + α³ = α² + 2. Then, (y -1)α - α² = 2. But α² = y -1 - α. Substitute: (y -1)α - (y -1 - α) = 2. Expand: (y -1)α - y +1 + α = 2. Combine terms: [(y -1)α + α] - y +1 = 2. This becomes yα - α + α - y +1 = 2 ⇒ yα - y +1 = 2 ⇒ yα - y = 1 ⇒ y(α -1) =1. Then, square both sides? Maybe not. Alternatively, write y = (1 + α + α²), and we have α³ = 2. Let’s try to express y in terms of α. Alternatively, write the minimal polynomial. Let’s suppose y = 1 + α + α². Then, let’s find a cubic equation. Compute y^3:\n\ny^3 = (1 + α + α²)^3. Expand:\n\n= 1 + 3α + 3α² + 3α^3 + 3α^4 + 3α^5 + α^6\n\nBut α³=2, so α^4=2α, α^5=2α², α^6=4.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n=1 + 3α + 3α² + 3*2 + 3*2α + 3*2α² +4\n\n=1 + 3α + 3α² +6 +6α +6α² +4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (1+6+4) + (3α +6α) + (3α² +6α²)\n\n=11 +9α +9α²\n\nBut y =1 + α + α², so 9y =9 +9α +9α². So y^3 =9y +2. Hence, minimal polynomial is y^3 -9y -2 =0. So the minimal polynomial is x³ -9x -2. This polynomial has integer coefficients, so y is an algebraic integer. Thus, y=1 + α + α² is in O_K. But y is already in ℤ[α], so no problem. Hence, elements like y\/3 would not be integral unless their norm is divisible by 27, but y=1 + α + α² has norm N(y) = product of conjugates. Wait, but earlier we saw that y^3 -9y -2=0, so norm(y) is the constant term up to sign. If the minimal polynomial is x³ -9x -2, then the norm is ±2. So norm(y)=2. Therefore, if β = y\/3, then norm(β)=2\/27, not integer. Hence, y\/3 is not integral. So even though y is in ℤ[α], dividing by 3 doesn't give an algebraic integer. Therefore, no elements of the form (a + bα +cα²)\/3 with a,b,c integers can be integral unless denominator is 1.\n\nTherefore, the ring ℤ[³√2] is integrally closed, hence it is the ring of integers. Therefore, the original claim is true.\n\nSo the problem is to show that ℤ[³√2] is the ring of integers of ℚ[³√2], and the assumptions are that ³√2 is a real cube root of 2, and ℤ[³√2] is the ring generated by this element. The key steps involve checking the discriminant and verifying there are no algebraic integers in the field not already in ℤ[³√2]. The discriminant approach seems the most straightforward: compute the discriminant of ℤ[³√2], show it's equal to the discriminant of the field, hence the index is 1, so it's the full ring of integers.",

Since the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ has degree 3, we have:\\n$$[\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\\\mathbb{Q}] = \\\\deg(f(x)) = 3$$\\n\\nAlternatively, we can see that $\\\\{1, \\\\alpha, \\\\alpha^2\\\\}$ forms a basis for $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ as a $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. This basis has 3 elements, confirming the dimension is 3.\\n\\n**Step 7: Conclude $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3**\\nA number field is defined as a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. We have shown:\\n1. $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a field extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$\\n2. The extension is finite with degree $[\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\\n\\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\\n\\n**Additional verification**: To confirm $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is indeed a field (not just a ring), we note that for any nonzero element $a + b\\\\alpha + c\\\\alpha^2$, its inverse exists in $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ because:\\n1. The minimal polynomial $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible, so $\\mathbb{Q}[x]\/(x^3 - 2)$ is a field\\n2. The isomorphism $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}] \\\\cong \\\\mathbb{Q}[x]\/(x^3 - 2)$ preserves the field structure\\n\\nThus, we have rigorously proven that $\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\"\n}",
