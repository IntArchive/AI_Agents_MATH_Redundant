    "Content":"I have noticed that to prove fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}})$ have class number one, we show they are Euclidean domains by tessellating the complex plane with the points $a+bv : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ , where $1, v$ is an integral basis.  Then any $c +dv$ in the field has distance $\\leq 1$ from some lattice point.  On the other hand a similar geometric argument fails with the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ , which does not have class number one. Any ring of integers of a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Dedekind domain, hence a PID if and only if a UFD.  But can such a ring be a PID but fail to be a Euclidean domain?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's what I think is a nice way to find a few PIDs that aren't Euclidean. It's not quite elementary, but if you know a bit about number fields I think it's a lot easier and nicer than the normal drudge. Let $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$ for $d>3$ squarefree, with ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Then the only units in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ are $\\pm1$. Suppose $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is Euclidean with Euclidean function $\\varphi$. Then take $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K\\setminus\\{0,\\pm1\\}$ with $\\varphi(x)$ minimal. By definition, any element of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ can be written in the form $px+r$ where $\\varphi(r) < \\varphi(x)$, so it must be that $r \\in \\{0,\\pm1\\}$, i.e. $|\\mathcal{O}_K\/(x)|$ is $2$ or $3$. In other words $\\mathcal{O}_K$ has a principal ideal of norm $2$ or $3$. So now we know that if $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})$ has class number one, where $d>3$ is squarefree*, $K$ is a non-Euclidean PID if there are no elements in $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of norm $\\pm2$ or $\\pm3$. As $K$ is a PID (and degree $2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$), this is equivalent to saying that $2$ and $3$ are inert. To find some examples then: If $d = 3\\pmod{4}$, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-d}}{2}]$, the minimal polynomial of $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-d}}{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $f_d(X)=X^2-X+\\frac{1+d}{4}$. Applying Dedekind's criterion gives that $d$ works provided that $f_d(X)$ is irreducible $\\pmod{2}$ and $\\pmod{3}$. This then gives that $d = 19$ works (which is the usual example), but also shows that $d = 43,67$ or $163$ work as well (I think!). *It can be shown that this implies $d \\in \\{1,2,3,7,11,19,43,67,163\\}$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proving some number rings are PIDs but not Euclidean, e.g. ℤ[(1+√-19)\/2]\". The question talks about showing certain number fields have class number one by proving they're Euclidean domains using geometric arguments, but mentions that similar arguments fail for others like ℚ(√−5). The main question is whether a ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ can be a PID but not a Euclidean domain.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the original problem was about proving A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions listed as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. The formatted problem then lists each assumption line by line, each addressing one property of one object. The problem statement is the main goal.\n\nNow, applying this to the current problem. The user is asking if a ring can be a PID but not Euclidean. The example given is ℤ[(1+√-19)\/2]. So the assumptions here would relate to the properties of that specific ring. Let's parse the original question:\n\n- The user mentions that rings of integers of finite extensions of ℚ are Dedekind domains, hence PIDs iff UFDs. But the key point is whether such a ring can be a PID but not Euclidean.\n\nSo, the problem is to show that certain number rings (like ℤ[(1+√-19)\/2]) are PIDs but not Euclidean domains. The assumptions would need to be the properties that define the ring and any conditions given. The original problem doesn't state assumptions explicitly, so we need to extract them from the context.\n\nLooking at the example, assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the ring in question is ℤ[(1+√-19)\/2], so the assumption is that this ring is the ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ. Also, the problem is to prove that it's a PID but not Euclidean.\n\nWait, but the problem as posed in the question is asking \"can such a ring be a PID but fail to be a Euclidean domain?\" So the problem is a yes\/no question with an example. But the user wants to structure the problem as per the format. The example given in the original user's example had an assumption and then the problem. Here, the problem is to prove that the specific ring is a PID but not Euclidean. So the assumptions would be the properties that the ring satisfies, such as being the ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ, being a PID, etc. But since the problem is to prove that it's a PID and not Euclidean, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions or given properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are the given conditions that the ring is a number ring (ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ), which is a Dedekind domain. Then the problem is to prove that such a ring (like the example given) is a PID but not Euclidean.\n\nBut the original problem is phrased as a question: \"But can such a ring be a PID but fail to be a Euclidean domain?\" So perhaps the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: The ring is the ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ.\nProblem: Can such a ring be a PID but not a Euclidean domain?\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem's variables. Here, the example given is ℤ[(1+√-19)\/2], so maybe the assumptions should include that this specific ring is being considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to prove that this specific ring is a PID but not Euclidean. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe title is \"Proving some number rings are PIDs but not Euclidean, e.g. ℤ[(1+√−19)\/2]\". The question in the body is asking if such rings can be PIDs but not Euclidean. So the actual problem to structure would be to prove that the given example ring is a PID but not Euclidean. Therefore, the assumptions would relate to the properties of that ring.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring in question is ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\n- The ring is a Dedekind domain (since it's the ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ).\n\nBut wait, the fact that it's a Dedekind domain is a general property of such rings, so maybe that's not an assumption but background knowledge. The problem is to prove two things: that it's a PID and that it's not Euclidean. So the assumptions would be the definitions or given properties needed for the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption: Let R be the ring ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\nProblem: Prove that R is a principal ideal domain but not a Euclidean domain.\n\nBut in the example provided, the assumptions were specific conditions on the variable n. Here, the problem is about a specific ring, so the assumption is just defining the ring in question. Since the problem is to prove two properties (PID and not Euclidean), perhaps the assumptions are:\n\nAssumption: Let R = ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\nProblem: Prove that R is a principal ideal domain but not a Euclidean domain.\n\nBut the user's example had each assumption line by line, each addressing one property. In this case, the only assumption is the definition of R. However, maybe there's more. The original problem mentions that rings of integers of finite extensions are Dedekind domains, hence PIDs iff UFDs. But the problem is whether they can be PIDs but not Euclidean. So maybe the assumptions are that R is a Dedekind domain (which is a given for rings of integers), and R is the ring of integers of ℚ(√−19). Then the problem is to prove R is a PID but not Euclidean.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might need to structure the assumptions as:\n\n- R is the ring of integers of a finite extension of ℚ.\n- R is a Dedekind domain.\n- R is isomorphic to ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating. The key is that the problem is to show that this specific ring is a PID but not Euclidean. So the main assumption is the definition of R. Therefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption: Let R be the ring ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\nProblem: Prove that R is a principal ideal domain but not a Euclidean domain.\n\nThat seems to fit the example's structure, where the assumption was defining the variable and its properties. Here, the assumption defines the ring R, and the problem is to prove two things about it. However, in the example, the assumption included two separate properties (n is integer, n divisible by 7). Here, the assumption is one line: defining R. So maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem requires more assumptions, like the ring is a Dedekind domain, but that's inherent in being the ring of integers, so maybe it's not necessary to state unless required. The user's example didn't include assumptions about 91 being 7*13, but only the variable's properties. So probably, the correct formatting here is:\n\nAssumption: R is the ring ℤ[(1 + √−19)\/2].\nProblem: Prove that R is a principal ideal domain but not a Euclidean domain.\n\nThat's concise and follows the example's structure. Each assumption line addresses one property. Here, the single assumption is defining R. The problem is to prove two properties about R.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: Assumption 1: $R$ is the ring $\\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right]$\nProblem:\nProve that $R$ is the ring of integers of a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$\nWe prove that $R = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right]$ is the ring of integers of the quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$, which is a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the field extension**\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$. This is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ since $\\sqrt{-19}$ satisfies the irreducible polynomial $x^2 + 19 = 0$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The extension degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, so $K$ is indeed a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall general theory for quadratic fields**\nFor a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a squarefree integer (not divisible by any perfect square other than 1), the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ (the integral closure of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$) is:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{O}_K &= \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}\\right] \\quad \\text{if } d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n\\mathcal{O}_K &= \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}] \\quad \\text{if } d \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 3: Check conditions for $d = -19$**\nFirst, $-19$ is squarefree: it is a prime number (in absolute value) and not divisible by any perfect square. Second, we check $d \\mod 4$:\n$$-19 = -20 + 1 = 4(-5) + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$$\nThus by the general theory, we expect $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right] = R$.\n\n**Step 4: Show $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$ (elements of $R$ are integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$)**\nLet $\\alpha = a + b\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right) \\in R$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We compute:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\alpha &= a + \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\sqrt{-19} \\\\\n&= \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right) + \\frac{b}{2}\\sqrt{-19}\n\\end{align*}\nLet $u = a + \\frac{b}{2}$ and $v = \\frac{b}{2}$. Then $\\alpha = u + v\\sqrt{-19}$.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n$$f(x) = x^2 - \\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha)x + \\operatorname{N}(\\alpha)$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\overline{\\alpha} = 2u$ and $\\operatorname{N}(\\alpha) = \\alpha\\overline{\\alpha} = u^2 + 19v^2$.\n\nSubstituting $u = a + \\frac{b}{2}$ and $v = \\frac{b}{2}$:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha) &= 2\\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right) = 2a + b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\\n\\operatorname{N}(\\alpha) &= \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + 19\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{19b^2}{4} \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + \\frac{20b^2}{4} \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab + 5b^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\end{align*}\nThus $f(x) = x^2 - (2a+b)x + (a^2+ab+5b^2)$ has integer coefficients, so $\\alpha$ is integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n\n**Step 5: Show $\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq R$ (all integral elements of $K$ are in $R$)**\nLet $\\beta = x + y\\sqrt{-19} \\in K$ be integral over $\\mathbb{Z}$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\beta$ is integral, its trace and norm are integers:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Tr}(\\beta) &= 2x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\\\\n\\operatorname{N}(\\beta) &= x^2 + 19y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\end{align*}\nFrom $2x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, let $2x = m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $x = m\/2$.\n\nFrom $x^2 + 19y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, substitute $x = m\/2$:\n$$\\frac{m^2}{4} + 19y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nMultiply by 4:\n$$m^2 + 76y^2 \\in 4\\mathbb{Z}$$\nThus $76y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $m^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), so $76y^2 = n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $y = p\/q$ in lowest terms with $p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $q > 0$, $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$. Then:\n$$76\\frac{p^2}{q^2} = n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nSo $q^2 \\mid 76p^2$. Since $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$, we have $\\gcd(p^2, q^2) = 1$, so $q^2 \\mid 76 = 2^2 \\cdot 19$.\nThus $q \\mid 2\\sqrt{19}$, but since $q \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $q$ must divide $2$ (as $\\sqrt{19}$ is irrational). So $q = 1$ or $q = 2$.\n\n**Case 1: $q = 1$**\nThen $y = p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. From $x^2 + 19y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $x = m\/2$, we have:\n$$\\frac{m^2}{4} + 19p^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThus $m^2\/4 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $4 \\mid m^2$, hence $2 \\mid m$. Let $m = 2k$, then $x = k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThen $\\beta = k + p\\sqrt{-19} = (2k-p) + 2p\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right) \\in R$.\n\n**Case 2: $q = 2$**\nThen $y = p\/2$ with $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. From $x^2 + 19y^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $x = m\/2$:\n$$\\frac{m^2}{4} + 19\\frac{p^2}{4} = \\frac{m^2 + 19p^2}{4} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\nThus $4 \\mid (m^2 + 19p^2)$. Since $19 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, we have $m^2 + 19p^2 \\equiv m^2 + 3p^2 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nChecking squares mod 4: $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 0$, $3^2 \\equiv 1$. So $m^2, p^2 \\in \\{0,1\\} \\pmod{4}$.\nFor $m^2 + 3p^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, we need:\n- If $p^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$\n- If $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $m^2 + 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, so $m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\nIn either case, $m^2 \\equiv p^2 \\pmod{4}$, so $m \\equiv p \\pmod{2}$.\n\nNow write $\\beta = x + y\\sqrt{-19} = \\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{p}{2}\\sqrt{-19} = \\frac{m-p}{2} + p\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right)$.\nSince $m \\equiv p \\pmod{2}$, $(m-p)\/2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, so $\\beta \\in R$.\n\nIn both cases, $\\beta \\in R$. Therefore $\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq R$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have shown $R \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_K$ and $\\mathcal{O}_K \\subseteq R$, so $R = \\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is by definition the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-19})$, and $K$ is a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ (degree 2), we conclude that $R = \\mathbb{Z}\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-19}}{2}\\right]$ is indeed the ring of integers of a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n∎",
