From Assumption 2: \"A is a list of n integers.\" In standard mathematical terminology, a list (or sequence) has a length that is a non-negative integer. Therefore, n must be a non-negative integer. Formally, n ∈ ℤ⁺ ∪ {0}, where ℤ⁺ denotes the set of positive integers.\n\n2. From Assumption 5: \"Each integer in B is between 1 and n (inclusive).\" This means that for every element b ∈ B, we have 1 ≤ b ≤ n. For this condition to be meaningful and non-vacuous, the interval [1, n] must be non-empty. An interval [1, n] is non-empty if and only if n ≥ 1. If n < 1, then the condition 1 ≤ b ≤ n would be impossible to satisfy for any real number b, since 1 > n.\n\n3. Combining the conclusions from steps 1 and 2:\n   - From step 1: n is a non-negative integer (n ≥ 0).\n   - From step 2: n ≥ 1.\n   Therefore, n satisfies both n ≥ 0 and n ≥ 1, which implies n ≥ 1. Since n is an integer (from step 1), we conclude that n is a positive integer.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\n\n1. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that n is not a positive integer. Since n represents the length of list A (Assumption 2), n must be an integer. The only way n can fail to be positive is if n ≤ 0.\n\n2. From Assumption 5: Each element b in B satisfies 1 ≤ b ≤ n.\n\n3. If n ≤ 0, then the inequality 1 ≤ b ≤ n implies 1 ≤ b ≤ 0. However, 1 > 0, so there is no real number b that can satisfy both 1 ≤ b and b ≤ 0 simultaneously. This is a contradiction because B is given to be a list of k integers (Assumption 4), and each such integer must satisfy the condition in Assumption 5.\n\n4. Therefore, our assumption that n ≤ 0 must be false. Hence, n > 0.\n\n5. From Assumption 2, n is an integer (the length of list A).\n\n6. Combining n > 0 and n ∈ ℤ, we conclude that n is a positive integer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth proof methods establish that under the given assumptions, n must be a positive integer. The key insight is that Assumption 5 (each element of B is between 1 and n) forces n to be at least 1, while Assumption 2 (A has length n) ensures n is an integer. Together, these imply n is a positive integer.",
