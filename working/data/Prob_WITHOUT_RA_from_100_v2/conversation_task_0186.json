For example, $\\delta = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ or $\\delta = \\min(\\epsilon, 1)$ would also work. The key requirement is that $\\delta \\leq \\epsilon$ to ensure that $|x - 1| < \\delta$ implies $|x - 1| < \\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ (specifically, $\\delta = \\epsilon$) such that if $0 < |x - 1| < \\delta$, then $|f(x) - 5| < \\epsilon$. By the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ definition of a limit, this proves that:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 1} (x + 4) = 5\n\\]\n\n**Additional remarks:**\n1. The proof is complete and rigorous.\n2. The function $f(x) = x + 4$ is linear, which makes the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ proof particularly straightforward.\n3. The choice $\\delta = \\epsilon$ is optimal in the sense that it's the largest possible $\\delta$ that works for all $\\epsilon > 0$.\n4. This proof demonstrates that the limit exists and equals 5, confirming the claim in the problem statement.",
