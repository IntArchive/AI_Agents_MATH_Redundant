    "Content":"I've never really understood how math induction is supposed to work. You have these 3 steps: Prove true for base case ( $n=0$ or $n=1$ or whatever) Assume true for $n=k$ .  Call this the induction hypothesis . Prove true for $n=k+1$ , somewhere using the induction hypothesis in your proof. In my experience the proof is usually algebraic, and you just manipulate the problem until you get the induction hypothesis to appear.  If you can do that and it works out, then you say the proof holds. Here's one I just worked out, Show $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^n}{x} = 0$ So you go: Use L'Hospital's rule. $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\ln x}{x} = 0$ .\nSince that's $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0$ . Assume true for $n=k$ . $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^k}{x} = 0$ . Prove true for $n=k+1$ .  You get $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^{k+1}}{x} = 0.$ Use L'Hospital again: $\\displaystyle\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(k+1)(\\ln x)^{k}}{x} = 0$ . Then you see the induction hypothesis appear, and you can say this is equal to $0$ . What I'm not comfortable with is this idea that you can just assume something to be true ( $n=k$ ), then based on that assumption, form a proof for $n=k+1$ case. I don't see how you can use something you've assumed to be true to prove something else to be true.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"The inductive step is a proof of an implication: you are proving that if the property you want holds for $k$ , then it holds for $k+1$ . It is a result of formal logic that if you can prove $P\\rightarrow Q$ (that $P$ implies $Q$ ), then from $P$ you can prove $Q$ ; and conversely , that if from assuming that $P$ is true you can prove $Q$ , then you can in fact prove $P\\rightarrow Q$ . We do this pretty much every time we prove something. For example, suppose you want to prove that if $n$ is a natural number, then $n^2$ is a natural number. How do we start? \"Let $n$ be a natural number.\" Wait! Why are you allowed to just assume that you already have a natural number? Shouldn't you have to start by proving it's a natural number? The answer is no , we don't have to, because we are not trying to prove an absolute, we are trying to prove a conditional statement: that if $n$ is a natural number, then something happens. So we may begin by assuming we are already in the case where the antecedent is true. (Intuitively, this is because if the antecedent is false, then the implication is necessarily true and there is nothing to be done; formally, it is because the Deduction Theorem, which is what I described above, tells you that if you manage to find a formal proof that ends with \" $n^2$ is a natural number\" by assuming that \" $n$ is a natural number\" is true, then you can use that proof to produce a formal proof that establishes the implication \"if $n$ is a natural number then $n^2$ is a natural number\"; we don't have to go through the exercise of actually producing the latter proof, we know it's \"out there\"). We do that in Calculus: \"if $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to x_0}f(x) = a$ and $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to x_0}g(x) = b$ , then $\\lim\\limits_{x\\to x_0}(f(x)+g(x)) = a+b$ .\" How do we prove this? We begin by assuming that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x\\to x_0$ is $a$ , and that the limit of $g(x)$ as $x\\to x_0$ is $b$ . We assume the premise\/antecedent, and proceed to try to prove the consequent. What this means in the case of induction is that, since the \"Inductive Step\" is actually a statement that says that an implication holds: $$\\mbox{\"It\" holds for $k$}\\rightarrow \\mbox{\"it\" holds for $k+1$},$$ then in order to prove this implication we can begin by assuming that the antecedent is already true, and then proceed to prove the consequent. Assuming that the antecedent is true is precisely the \"Induction Hypothesis\". When you are done with the inductive step, you have in fact not proven that it holds for any particular number, you have only shown that if it holds for a particular number $k$ , then it must hold for the next number $k+1$ . It is a conditional statement, not an absolute one. It is only when you combine that conditional statement with the base, which is an absolute statement that says \"it\" holds for a specific number, that you can conclude that the original statement holds for all natural numbers (greater than or equal to the base). Since you mention dominoes in your title, I assume you are familiar with the standard metaphor of induction like dominoes that are standing all in a row falling. The inductive step is like arguing that all the dominoes will fall if you topple the first one (without actually toppling it): first, you argue that each domino is sufficiently close to the next domino so that if one falls, then the next one falls. You are not tumbling every domino. And when you argue this, you argue along the lines of \"suppose this one falls; since it's length is ...\", that is, you assume it falls in order to argue the next one will then fall. This is the same with the inductive step. In a sense you are right that it feels like \"cheating\" to assume what you want; but the point is that you aren't really assuming what you want. Again, the inductive step does not in fact establish that the result holds for any number, it only establishes a conditional statement. If the result happens to hold for some $k$ , then it would necessarily have to also hold for $k+1$ . But we are completely silent on whether it actually holds for $k$ or not. We are not saying anything about that at the inductive-step stage. Added: Here's an example to emphasize that the \"inductive step\" does not make any absolute statement, but only a conditional statement: Suppose you want to prove that for all natural numbers $n$ , $n+1 = n$ . Inductive step. Induction Hypothesis: The statement holds for $k$ ; that is, I'm assuming that $k+1 = k$ . To be proven: The statement holds for $k+1$ . Indeed: notice that since $k+1= k$ , then adding one to both sides of the equation we have $(k+1)+1 = k+1$ ; this proves the statement holds for $k+1$ . QED This is a perfectly valid proof! It says that if $k+1=k$ , then $(k+1)+1=k+1$ . This is true! Of course, the antecedent is never true, but the implication is. The reason this is not a full proof by induction of a false statement is that there is no \"base\"; the inductive step only proves the conditional, nothing more. By the way: Yes, most proofs by induction that one encounters early on involve algebraic manipulations, but not all proofs by induction are of that kind. Consider the following simplified game of Nim: there are a certain number of matchsticks, and players alternate taking $1$ , $2$ , or $3$ matchsticks every turn. The person who takes the last matchstick wins. Proposition. In the simplified game above, the first player has a winning strategy if the number of matchsticks is not divisible by $4$ , and the second player has a winning strategy if the number of matchsticks is divisible by 4. The proof is by (strong) induction, and it involves no algebraic manipulations whatsoever.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user is asking about understanding mathematical induction, using an example involving limits and L'Hospital's Rule. The main confusion seems to be about how assuming the induction hypothesis (for n=k) allows proving the case for n=k+1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem from the original question. The example given in the question is about showing that the limit of (ln x)^n \/ x as x approaches infinity is 0 using induction. The user goes through the steps: base case with n=1, assume true for n=k, then prove for n=k+1 by applying L'Hospital's Rule, which reduces the problem to the induction hypothesis.\n\nThe user's problem is not with the specific example per se, but with the general concept of induction—how assuming the hypothesis allows the proof. However, the task is to structure the problem as per the given format, so I need to filter out the example's specifics and the user's confusion to present the problem they are working on.\n\nLooking at the example provided by the user (the limit problem), the assumptions would involve the base case and the induction step. But in the problem statement, we need to list each assumption line by line. Let's see:\n\nThe problem is to show that the limit of (ln x)^n \/ x as x approaches infinity is 0. The assumptions here would include the base case (n=1) already proven, and the induction hypothesis (assuming it's true for n=k). But the original problem as stated by the user is to show the limit equals 0 for all n, using induction. So the problem statement would be that. \n\nBut in the example format, the assumptions are specific conditions applied to one object each. So for the problem, the user is using induction where:\n\nAssumption 1: The base case n=1 is proven (i.e., limit for n=1 is 0).\nAssumption 2: Assume true for n=k (induction hypothesis).\nProblem: Prove it for n=k+1.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just to perform the induction step; the original problem is to show for all n, the limit is 0. The user is using induction to do this. However, the way the example was structured was taking specific assumptions from the problem. In the original example given by the user, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, with the assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is about the limit, and the induction steps are part of the method, not the problem's assumptions. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user's question is about their confusion with induction, but the actual problem they are working on is the limit one. So to structure the problem as per the format, the problem is to prove that the limit of (ln x)^n \/ x as x approaches infinity is 0 for all positive integers n. The assumptions would include that n is a positive integer, and perhaps the base case (n=1) holds, but maybe the problem doesn't state that. Wait, the original problem as presented by the user is to \"Show lim_{x→∞} (ln x)^n \/ x = 0\". So the problem is to show that for any positive integer n, this limit holds. The user is using induction to do this. \n\nBut the problem itself, as a standalone question, would have assumptions like:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Show that lim_{x→∞} (ln x)^n \/ x = 0.\n\nBut the user's example includes specific assumptions from the problem. However, in the given example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but the user's formatted problem listed those as assumptions and the problem. Here, the problem is about the limit, and the method is induction. The user's confusion is about induction, but the actual problem to structure is the limit one. However, the user's own example structured the problem with assumptions from the problem statement. In the limit problem, the only assumption is that n is a positive integer, perhaps. Because the problem is to show for every n (positive integer), the limit is zero. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Show that lim_{x→∞} (ln x)^n \/ x = 0.\n\nBut in the original problem description by the user, they mention using L'Hospital's rule for the base case (n=1) and then the induction step. However, the problem statement itself doesn't specify that n must be a positive integer; it's implied by the induction approach. So perhaps the key assumption here is that n is a positive integer. \n\nAlternatively, the original problem might not state that n is an integer, but the user is using induction, which requires n to be an integer. Therefore, the problem's assumption is that n is a positive integer, and the problem is to show the limit. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: n is a positive integer.\n\nProblem: Prove that lim_{x→∞} (ln x)^n \/ x = 0.\n\nBut looking back at the example, the original problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. In the limit problem, the key assumption is that n is a positive integer. So the formatted problem should list that assumption, and the problem is to prove the limit.\n\nBut in the user's example, the original problem's assumptions were split into separate lines. So here, the assumption is \"n is a positive integer\" and that's it. The problem is to prove the limit. Therefore, the final formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(\\ln x)^n}{x} = 0.$$\n\nThat seems to fit the format. The user's confusion about induction is part of their thought process but the actual problem they are tackling is the limit, with the assumption that n is a positive integer, and they use induction to prove it. So the formatted problem should capture that.",

Let P(n) be a property defined for all positive integers n. We want to show that if P(k) is true for some positive integer k, then P(k+1) is also true.\n\nStep 1: Identify the property P(n)\nLet P(n) be an arbitrary property defined on positive integers. The specific form of P(n) depends on the particular statement we are trying to prove by induction. For the purpose of this proof, we consider P(n) as a generic property.\n\nStep 2: Inductive hypothesis\nAssume that P(k) is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. This is our inductive hypothesis. The assumption is that the property holds for this particular value k.\n\nStep 3: Show P(k+1) is true\nUsing the assumption that P(k) is true, we must demonstrate through logical reasoning and algebraic manipulation that P(k+1) must also be true. The specific reasoning depends on the nature of property P. Generally, this involves:\n\na) Expressing P(k+1) in terms related to P(k)\nb) Using the truth of P(k) to establish relationships\nc) Performing algebraic manipulations to transform the expression for P(k+1)\nd) Applying logical deductions to conclude that P(k+1) is true\n\nFor example, if P(n) is a statement about a sum: P(n): 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)\/2, then:\n- P(k): 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)\/2\n- P(k+1): 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)\/2\n\nTo show P(k+1) from P(k):\nStart with the left side of P(k+1): 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1)\nBy the inductive hypothesis P(k), this equals: k(k+1)\/2 + (k+1)\nCombine terms: = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))\/2 = (k+1)(k+2)\/2\nWhich is exactly the right side of P(k+1).\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nWe have shown that assuming P(k) is true leads to the conclusion that P(k+1) is true. Since k was an arbitrary positive integer, this implication holds for all positive integers k. Therefore, we have proven that P(k) → P(k+1) for all positive integers k, completing the inductive step of the proof by mathematical induction.\n\nNote: The actual content of steps 2 and 3 depends on the specific property P(n). The above provides the general structure and an example of how the reasoning proceeds. The key is that the proof must establish a logical connection between P(k) and P(k+1) using the assumption that P(k) is true.",
