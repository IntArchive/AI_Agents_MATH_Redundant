    "Content":"The largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix (i.e. a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$) is $1$. Wikipedia marks this as a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem , but I wonder if there is a simpler (more direct) way to demonstrate this result.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's a really elementary proof (which is a slight modification of Fanfan's answer to a question of mine ). As Calle shows, it is easy to see that the eigenvalue $1$ is obtained.  Now, suppose $Ax = \\lambda x$ for some $\\lambda > 1$.  Since the rows of $A$ are nonnegative and sum to $1$, each element of vector $Ax$ is a convex combination of the components of $x$, which can be no greater than $x_{max}$, the largest component of $x$.  On the other hand, at least one element of $\\lambda x$ is greater than $x_{max}$, which proves that $\\lambda > 1$ is impossible.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified Assumption and Problem sections. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The title is \"Proof that the largest eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix is $1$\". The question states that a stochastic matrix has entries that are positive and whose rows add up to $1$. The user is asking for a simpler proof than using Perron-Frobenius.\n\nNow, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about a stochastic matrix. The assumptions should list each property one by one. Let's break down the definition of a stochastic matrix here. \n\nFirst assumption: The matrix has positive entries. Wait, actually, stochastic matrices are often defined as having non-negative entries, but the question here specifies \"positive\". However, I should check the exact wording. The original question says \"a matrix whose entries are positive and whose rows add up to $1$\". So according to the user's problem statement, entries are positive (not just non-negative), so that's one assumption. Each row sums to 1. So each row of the matrix adds up to 1. Also, the matrix in question is a stochastic matrix, so those are the key properties.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The matrix has positive entries.\n2. Each row of the matrix adds up to 1.\n\nEach assumption addresses one property of the matrix. Then the problem is to prove that the largest eigenvalue is 1. \n\nWait, but sometimes in definitions, stochastic matrices can allow non-negative entries. But the question explicitly mentions entries are positive, so I have to stick with that. The user might have a stricter definition here, maybe. So I need to follow exactly what the question states. \n\nSo the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nEntries of the matrix are positive,\nEach row of the matrix adds up to 1.\nProblem:\nProve that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix is $1$.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the example provided. In the example, the assumption listed two points: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Then the problem was to prove divisibility by 91. So similarly, here, the two assumptions are about the matrix's entries and row sums, leading to the problem about the eigenvalue. That should be correct.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: Entries of the matrix are positive\nAssumption 2: Each row of the matrix adds up to $1$\nProblem:\nProve that $\\lambda > 1$\nLet A be an n×n matrix with the following properties:\n1. All entries a_{ij} > 0 for i,j = 1,...,n\n2. For each row i, ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1\n\nWe need to analyze the eigenvalues of A.\n\n**Step 1: A is a stochastic matrix**\nBy definition, a matrix is (row) stochastic if all entries are non-negative and each row sums to 1. Since a_{ij} > 0 > 0, A is a positive stochastic matrix.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Perron-Frobenius theorem**\nThe Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices states:\n1. There exists a positive eigenvalue r = ρ(A) (the spectral radius) that is a simple eigenvalue\n2. r > |λ| for all other eigenvalues λ of A\n3. The eigenvector corresponding to r has all positive entries\n\nSince A is stochastic, we can find the spectral radius directly. Consider the vector v = [1, 1, ..., 1]^T. Then:\n(Av)_i = ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij}·1 = 1 for all i = 1,...,n\nThus Av = v, showing that 1 is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector v.\n\nSince all entries are positive, by Perron-Frobenius, the spectral radius ρ(A) must be at least 1 (as 1 is an eigenvalue). To show ρ(A) = 1, we use the fact that for any matrix norm induced by a vector norm, ρ(A) ≤ ||A||. For the maximum row sum norm ||A||_∞ = max_i ∑_{j=1}^n |a_{ij}| = 1 (since each row sums to 1 and entries are positive). Therefore, ρ(A) ≤ 1. Combining with ρ(A) ≥ 1 (since 1 is an eigenvalue), we conclude ρ(A) = 1.\n\n**Step 3: λ = 1 is an eigenvalue**\nAs shown above, with v = [1, 1, ..., 1]^T, we have Av = v, so λ = 1 is indeed an eigenvalue.\n\n**Step 4: All eigenvalues satisfy |λ| ≤ 1**\nWe can prove this using the Gershgorin circle theorem. For each row i of A, the Gershgorin disk is centered at a_{ii} with radius R_i = ∑_{j≠i} |a_{ij}| = ∑_{j≠i} a_{ij} (since entries are positive). Since ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1, we have a_{ii} + R_i = 1, so the disk is centered at a_{ii} with radius 1 - a_{ii}. The disk is contained in the circle centered at a_{ii} with radius 1 - a_{ii}, which is itself contained in the closed unit disk in the complex plane (since a_{ii} ≥ 0 and 1 - a_{ii} ≥ 0, the farthest point from the origin is at a_{ii} + (1 - a_{ii}) = 1).\n\nAlternatively, we can use properties of stochastic matrices: For any stochastic matrix P, ρ(P) = 1, and all eigenvalues λ satisfy |λ| ≤ 1. This follows from considering the ∞-norm as above: ρ(P) ≤ ||P||_∞ = 1.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nWe have shown:\n1. A is a positive stochastic matrix\n2. The spectral radius ρ(A) = 1\n3. λ = 1 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1, 1, ..., 1]^T\n4. All eigenvalues λ of A satisfy |λ| ≤ 1\n\nTherefore, no eigenvalue λ of A can satisfy λ > 1. In fact, the only eigenvalue on the unit circle is λ = 1 (by Perron-Frobenius, since A is positive, all other eigenvalues satisfy |λ| < 1).",
