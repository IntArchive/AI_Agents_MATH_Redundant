This follows directly from the definition/construction of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\\n\\n**Proof:**\\n\\n1. **Construction of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$:** The ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ is constructed as the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$, where $X$ is an indeterminate and $(X^2 + n)$ is the ideal generated by $X^2 + n$.\\n\\n2. **Identification of $\\sqrt{-n}$:** In this construction, we identify the coset $X + (X^2 + n)$ with the element $\\sqrt{-n}$. That is, $\\sqrt{-n}$ is defined to be the image of $X$ under the quotient map $\\mathbb{Z}[X] \\to \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$.\\n\\n3. **Relation in the quotient ring:** In the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$, we have the relation $X^2 + n \\equiv 0$ modulo the ideal $(X^2 + n)$. This means $X^2 \\equiv -n$ in the quotient ring.\\n\\n4. **Applying the identification:** Since $\\sqrt{-n}$ corresponds to $X$ in the quotient ring, we have:\\n   $$\\n   \\sqrt{-n}^2 = (X + (X^2 + n))^2 = X^2 + (X^2 + n) = -n + (X^2 + n) = -n\\n   $$\\n   where the last equality holds because $X^2 + n$ is in the ideal $(X^2 + n)$, which is the zero element in the quotient ring.\\n\\n5. **Alternative direct argument:** More directly, by the very definition of $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ as the smallest subring of $\\mathbb{C}$ containing $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\sqrt{-n}$, the element $\\sqrt{-n}$ must satisfy $\\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$, since otherwise it wouldn't be a square root of $-n$.\\n\\n6. **Verification:** We can verify this algebraically:\\n   $$\\n   \\sqrt{-n}^2 = (\\sqrt{-n}) \\cdot (\\sqrt{-n}) = \\sqrt{(-n) \\cdot (-n)} = \\sqrt{n^2} = n \\cdot \\sqrt{1} = n \\cdot (\\pm 1)\\n   $$\\n   However, this naive calculation in $\\mathbb{C}$ is not quite correct for the formal symbol $\\sqrt{-n}$. The correct interpretation is that $\\sqrt{-n}$ is defined to be an element whose square is $-n$, so $\\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$ by definition.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $\\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$, which follows from the construction of the ring as $\\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$ or equivalently from the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as an element satisfying this relation.\\n\\n**Note:** The given assumptions about $n$ being an integer $\\geq 3$, square-free, and the irreducibility of certain elements are not needed for this proof, as the identity $\\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$ is a fundamental defining property of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\"\n}",
