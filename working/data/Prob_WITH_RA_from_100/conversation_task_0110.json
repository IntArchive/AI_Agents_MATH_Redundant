We want to analyze the difference quotient for the function t ↦ ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩.\\n\\n1. **Define the difference quotient**: For a fixed t ∈ ℝ and h ≠ 0, define the difference quotient:\\n   Q(h) = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩] / h\\n\\n2. **Add and subtract a strategic term**: To break this into manageable parts, we add and subtract ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ in the numerator:\\n   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩] + [⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩]\\n\\n   This is valid because:\\n   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ + ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩\\n   which is exactly the expression above.\\n\\n3. **Divide each term by h**: Now we divide the entire expression by h:\\n   Q(h) = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩] / h + [⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩] / h\\n\\n4. **Factor using inner product properties**: For the first term, we use the linearity of the inner product in its second argument (or conjugate linearity, depending on convention; for real vector spaces it's linear in both arguments):\\n   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h) - g(t)⟩\\n   \\n   For the second term, we use linearity in the first argument:\\n   ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h) - f(t), g(t)⟩\\n\\n5. **Combine with division by h**: Substituting these factorizations:\\n   Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), [g(t+h) - g(t)] / h⟩ + ⟨[f(t+h) - f(t)] / h, g(t)⟩\\n\\n   This is the key algebraic manipulation that breaks the difference quotient into two parts:\\n   - The first term involves f(t+h) and the difference quotient for g\\n   - The second term involves the difference quotient for f and g(t)\\n\\n6. **Interpretation**: This manipulation shows that:\\n   Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), Δ_g(h)⟩ + ⟨Δ_f(h), g(t)⟩\\n   where Δ_f(h) = [f(t+h) - f(t)] / h and Δ_g(h) = [g(t+h) - g(t)] / h are the difference quotients for f and g respectively.\\n\\n7. **Connection to the product rule**: Taking the limit as h → 0:\\n   - Since f is differentiable, lim_{h→0} Δ_f(h) = f'(t)\\n   - Since g is differentiable, lim_{h→0} Δ_g(h) = g'(t)\\n   - Since f is continuous (differentiable functions are continuous), lim_{h→0} f(t+h) = f(t)\\n   - By continuity of the inner product, we can take limits inside:\\n     lim_{h→0} Q(h) = ⟨f(t), g'(t)⟩ + ⟨f'(t), g(t)⟩\\n\\n   This establishes the product rule for inner products: d/dt ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f'(t), g(t)⟩ + ⟨f(t), g'(t)⟩.\\n\\nThus, the algebraic manipulation Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), [g(t+h)-g(t)]/h⟩ + ⟨[f(t+h)-f(t)]/h, g(t)⟩ successfully breaks the difference quotient into two parts that lead to the product rule for inner products.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"
