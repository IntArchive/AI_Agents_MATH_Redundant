        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function\nAssumption 2: Continuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined via convergence of all sequences $(z_n) \\in E$ satisfying $z_n \\to a$\nAssumption 3: Continuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined via the $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ criterion\nAssumption 4: The provided proof of $(1) \\implies (2)$ uses the Axiom of Choice\nProblem:\nProve that $f(x)=\\begin{cases}1 & x=a\\\\ 0 &x\\neq a\\end{cases}$\nWe will prove that the function f: E → ℂ defined by f(x) = 1 if x = a and f(x) = 0 if x ≠ a is discontinuous at a under both definitions of continuity.\n\n**Part 1: Discontinuity under the sequential definition**\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that f is sequentially continuous at a. By the sequential definition of continuity, this means that for every sequence (x_n) in E such that x_n → a, we must have f(x_n) → f(a).\n\nConsider any sequence (x_n) in E\\{a} (that is, x_n ≠ a for all n) that converges to a. Such a sequence exists if a is not an isolated point of E. If a is an isolated point, then the only sequence converging to a is eventually constant at a, in which case f would be trivially continuous. We assume E contains points other than a or that a is not isolated.\n\nFor this sequence (x_n) with x_n → a and x_n ≠ a for all n, we have:\n- f(x_n) = 0 for all n (since x_n ≠ a)\n- f(a) = 1\n\nThus, f(x_n) → 0, but f(a) = 1. Since 0 ≠ 1, we have f(x_n) ↛ f(a). This contradicts the assumption that f is sequentially continuous at a.\n\nTherefore, f is not sequentially continuous at a.\n\n**Part 2: Discontinuity under the ε-δ definition**\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that f is continuous at a according to the ε-δ definition. This means that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z ∈ E with |z-a| < δ, we have |f(z)-f(a)| < ε.\n\nTake ε = 1/2. By the assumed continuity, there must exist some δ > 0 such that for all z ∈ E with |z-a| < δ, we have |f(z)-f(a)| < 1/2.\n\nNow, choose any point z ∈ E with 0 < |z-a| < δ. Such a point exists if a is not an isolated point of E. If a is isolated, then the only point satisfying |z-a| < δ for sufficiently small δ is z = a itself, and in that case f would be trivially continuous. We assume E contains points other than a arbitrarily close to a.\n\nFor this chosen z with 0 < |z-a| < δ, we have:\n- Since z ≠ a, f(z) = 0\n- f(a) = 1\n- Therefore, |f(z)-f(a)| = |0-1| = 1\n\nBut 1 > 1/2 = ε, so |f(z)-f(a)| is not less than ε. This contradicts the existence of δ for ε = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, no such δ exists for ε = 1/2, and f is not continuous at a according to the ε-δ definition.\n\n**Conclusion:** The function f defined by f(x) = 1 if x = a and f(x) = 0 if x ≠ a is discontinuous at a under both the sequential definition and the ε-δ definition of continuity, provided that a is not an isolated point of E (i.e., there exist points in E arbitrarily close to a but different from a).",
