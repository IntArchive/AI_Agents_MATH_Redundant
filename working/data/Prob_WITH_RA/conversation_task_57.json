Since (f_n) is Cauchy in sup norm (assumption 4), it is bounded: ∃M such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n.\n2. From assumption 5, f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) exists pointwise.\n3. Show f is bounded: For any x ∈ X, |f_n(x)| ≤ M for all n. Taking limit as n→∞ gives |f(x)| ≤ M, so f is bounded.\n4. Show f is continuous: Fix x₀ ∈ X, ε > 0. Since (f_n) is Cauchy, ∃N such that for all m,n ≥ N, ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/3. Fix n ≥ N. Since f_n ∈ C_b(X) is continuous, ∃ neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U, |f_n(x) - f_n(x₀)| < ε/3.\n   For any x ∈ U: |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ |f(x) - f_n(x)| + |f_n(x) - f_n(x₀)| + |f_n(x₀) - f(x₀)|.\n   We need to bound the first and third terms. Since (f_n) is Cauchy and f is pointwise limit, for n ≥ N and any x: |f(x) - f_n(x)| = lim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ limsup_{m→∞} ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/3.\n   Similarly, |f_n(x₀) - f(x₀)| ≤ ε/3.\n   Thus |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε, so f is continuous.\n5. Show uniform convergence: For ε > 0, choose N as above. For n ≥ N and any x ∈ X: |f(x) - f_n(x)| = lim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ limsup_{m→∞} ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε.\n   Since this holds for all x, ‖f_n - f‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε. Thus ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0.\n6.

Let (f_n) be a Cauchy sequence in (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞), and assume that for each x ∈ X, the pointwise limit f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) exists. Prove that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is complete by showing that f ∈ C_b(X) and ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe prove that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is complete by showing that every Cauchy sequence converges to a limit in the space. Let (f_n) be a Cauchy sequence in C_b(X).\n\n**1. Define the limit function and show it is bounded.**\nBy assumption, for each x ∈ X, the sequence of real numbers (f_n(x)) converges. Let f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x). This defines a function f: X → ℝ.\n\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, it is bounded. That is, there exists a constant M > 0 such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n ∈ ℕ.\nThis means that for any x ∈ X and any n ∈ ℕ, we have |f_n(x)| ≤ ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M.\nTaking the limit as n → ∞, we get:\n|f(x)| = |lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)| = lim_{n→∞} |f_n(x)| ≤ M.\nSince this holds for all x ∈ X, the function f is bounded, with ‖f‖_∞ ≤ M.\n\n**2. Show that f is continuous.**\nWe want to show that the convergence is uniform, which implies the limit function is continuous. Let ε > 0.\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an integer N such that for all m, n ≥ N,\n‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/2.\nThis means that for all x ∈ X and all m, n ≥ N, we have |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2.\n\nNow, let n ≥ N and let x ∈ X. Taking the limit as m → ∞ in the inequality above, we get:\nlim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2\n|lim_{m→∞} f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2\n|f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2.\n\nSince this inequality holds for all x ∈ X, we can take the supremum over all x:\nsup_{x∈X} |f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε.\nThis means that for all n ≥ N, ‖f - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε.\nThis shows that the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly to f.\n\nNow we show f is continuous. Since each f_n is continuous and the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly to f, the limit function f must be continuous. (This is a standard theorem: the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous).\nAlternatively, using an ε/3 argument:\nFix x₀ ∈ X and ε > 0.\nFrom the uniform convergence shown above, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, ‖f - f_n‖_∞ < ε/3.\nIn particular, for N, we have |f(x) - f_N(x)| < ε/3 for all x ∈ X.\nSince f_N is continuous at x₀, there exists a neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U, |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3.\nNow, for any x ∈ U, we use the triangle inequality:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ |f(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| + |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\n< ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε.\nThus, f is continuous at x₀. Since x₀ was arbitrary, f is continuous on X.\n\n**3. Conclusion.**\nWe have shown that the pointwise limit function f is bounded and continuous, so f ∈ C_b(X). We have also shown that ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0 as n → ∞.\nTherefore, an arbitrary Cauchy sequence (f_n) in C_b(X) converges to a limit f in C_b(X). This proves that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is a complete metric space.\n\nfinal:"

Let (f_n) be a Cauchy sequence in C_b(X).\n\n**1. Define the limit function and show it is bounded.**\nBy assumption, for each x ∈ X, the sequence of real numbers (f_n(x)) converges. Let f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x). This defines a function f: X → ℝ.\n\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, it is bounded. That is, there exists a constant M > 0 such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n ∈ ℕ.\nThis means that for any x ∈ X and any n ∈ ℕ, we have |f_n(x)| ≤ ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M.\nTaking the limit as n → ∞, we get:\n|f(x)| = |lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)| = lim_{n→∞} |f_n(x)| ≤ M.\nSince this holds for all x ∈ X, the function f is bounded, with ‖f‖_∞ ≤ M.\n\n**2. Show that f is continuous.**\nWe want to show that the convergence is uniform, which implies the limit function is continuous. Let ε > 0.\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an integer N such that for all m, n ≥ N,\n‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/2.\nThis means that for all x ∈ X and all m, n ≥ N, we have |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2.\n\nNow, let n ≥ N and let x ∈ X. Taking the limit as m → ∞ in the inequality above, we get:\nlim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2\n|lim_{m→∞} f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2\n|f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2.\n\nSince this inequality holds for all x ∈ X, we can take the supremum over all x:\nsup_{x∈X} |f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε.\nThis means that for all n ≥ N, ‖f - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε.\nThis shows that the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly to f.\n\nNow we show f is continuous. Since each f_n is continuous and the sequence (f_n) converges uniformly to f, the limit function f must be continuous. (This is a standard theorem: the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous).\nAlternatively, using an ε/3 argument:\nFix x₀ ∈ X and ε > 0.\nFrom the uniform convergence shown above, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, ‖f - f_n‖_∞ < ε/3.\nIn particular, for N, we have |f(x) - f_N(x)| < ε/3 for all x ∈ X.\nSince f_N is continuous at x₀, there exists a neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U, |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3.\nNow, for any x ∈ U, we use the triangle inequality:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ |f(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| + |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\n< ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε.\nThus, f is continuous at x₀. Since x₀ was arbitrary, f is continuous on X.\n\n**3. Conclusion.**\nWe have shown that the pointwise limit function f is bounded and continuous, so f ∈ C_b(X). We have also shown that ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0 as n → ∞.\nTherefore, an arbitrary Cauchy sequence (f_n) in C_b(X) converges to a limit f in C_b(X). This proves that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is a complete metric space.\n\nfinal:"

Since (f_n) is Cauchy in sup norm (assumption 4), it is bounded: ∃M such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n.\n2. From assumption 5, f(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x) exists pointwise.\n3. Show f is bounded: For any x ∈ X, |f_n(x)| ≤ M for all n. Taking limit as n→∞ gives |f(x)| ≤ M, so f is bounded.\n4. Show f is continuous: Fix x₀ ∈ X, ε > 0. Since (f_n) is Cauchy, ∃N such that for all m,n ≥ N, ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/3. Fix n ≥ N. Since f_n ∈ C_b(X) is continuous, ∃ neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U, |f_n(x) - f_n(x₀)| < ε/3.\n   For any x ∈ U: |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ |f(x) - f_n(x)| + |f_n(x) - f_n(x₀)| + |f_n(x₀) - f(x₀)|.\n   We need to bound the first and third terms. Since (f_n) is Cauchy and f is pointwise limit, for n ≥ N and any x: |f(x) - f_n(x)| = lim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ limsup_{m→∞} ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/3.\n   Similarly, |f_n(x₀) - f(x₀)| ≤ ε/3.\n   Thus |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε, so f is continuous.\n5. Show uniform convergence: For ε > 0, choose N as above. For n ≥ N and any x ∈ X: |f(x) - f_n(x)| = lim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ limsup_{m→∞} ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε.\n   Since this holds for all x, ‖f_n - f‖_∞ ≤ ε/2 < ε. Thus ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0.\n6. Therefore f ∈ C_b(X) and f_n → f uniformly, so (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is complete.\n\nDeduction of redundant assumption: From step 5, for any ε > 0, ∃N such that for all n ≥ N and all x ∈ X, |f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε. This is exactly the statement |f(x) - f_n(x)| = lim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε (with appropriate choice of ε).\n",
