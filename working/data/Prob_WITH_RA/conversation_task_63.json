There cannot be a fractional number of subsets.\n\n4. **Formal Justification:**\n   - Let $S$ be a set with $|S| = n$.\n   - The number of $k$-element subsets of $S$ is given by:\n     $$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n   - This formula can be derived by considering:\n     a) There are $n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ ways to choose $k$ elements in order.\n     b) Each $k$-element subset can be arranged in $k!$ different orders.\n     c) Therefore, the number of unordered selections is $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n\n5. **Alternative Proofs (for completeness):**\n   - **Induction using Pascal's Identity:**\n     Pascal's identity states: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}$ for $0 < k < n$.\n     Base cases: $\\binom{n}{0} = \\binom{n}{n} = 1$ (integers).\n     Inductive step: Assuming $\\binom{n-1}{j}$ are integers for all $0 \\leq j \\leq n-1$, then $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the sum of two integers, hence an integer.\n   \n   - **Prime Factorization Argument:**\n     For any prime $p$, let $v_p(m)$ denote the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $m$.\n     Legendre's formula gives: $v_p(n!) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor$.\n     We need to show: $v_p(n!) \\geq v_p(k!) + v_p((n-k)!)$ for all primes $p$.\n     This follows from the inequality: $\\lfloor x+y \\rfloor \\geq \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor$ applied to $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\rfloor \\geq \\lfloor \\frac{k}{p^i} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{n-k}{p^i} \\rfloor$.\n     Since all prime factors in the denominator appear with at least the same multiplicity in the numerator, the quotient is an integer.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Under the given assumptions ($n$ integer, $k$ integer, $0 \\leq k \\leq n$), the expression $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ represents the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$, which counts the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. Since we are counting discrete objects, the result must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is always an integer.\n\n**Note:** The combinatorial interpretation provides the most intuitive proof, while the alternative proofs offer different perspectives and mathematical rigor.",

Since $\\binom{n}{k}$ counts the number of such subsets, its value must be a non-negative integer.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, for any integers $n$ and $k$ such that $0 \\leq k \\leq n$, the expression $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is always an integer.\n\n***\n\n*Alternative Proof using Pascal's Identity:*\n\n**Base Cases:** For any $n \\geq 0$, $\\binom{n}{0} = \\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!} = 1$ and $\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{n!}{n!(n-n)!} = 1$.

For $1 \\leq k \\leq m$, we use Pascal's Identity:\n$$ \\binom{m+1}{k} = \\binom{m}{k-1} + \\binom{m}{k} $$\nBy the inductive hypothesis, both $\\binom{m}{k-1}$ and $\\binom{m}{k}$ are integers (since $0 \\leq k-1 < k \\leq m$). The sum of two integers is always an integer. Thus, $\\binom{m+1}{k}$ is an integer.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, $\\binom{n}{k}$ is an integer for all integers $n, k$ with $0 \\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nfinal:"
