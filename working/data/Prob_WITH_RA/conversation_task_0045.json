            "text": "Looking at the notes, I see previous analyses of different problems. For the current problem about angle addition formulas, I need to determine if there's a redundant assumption.\n\n**Step 4: Final analysis**\nLooking at the three assumptions:\n1. α is a real number\n2. β is a real number  \n3. $a \\cdot b = |a| |b| \\cos \\theta$\n\nThe first two assumptions (α and β are real numbers) are necessary for the trigonometric functions to be defined. The third assumption provides the geometric tool (dot product formula) needed for the proof.\n\nActually, I think I may have found the redundancy. The problem asks to prove formulas for $\\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta)$ and $\\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta)$. The dot product formula already contains $\\cos \\theta$. If we're trying to prove the cosine addition formula, and we already have a formula that defines cosine in terms of dot product, there might be circular reasoning or redundancy.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The standard geometric proof using vectors goes like this:\n1. Consider unit vectors making angles α and β with the x-axis\n2. Their coordinates are $(\\cos α, \\sin α)$ and $(\\cos β, \\sin β)$\n3. The dot product gives $\\cos(α - β) = \\cos α \\cos β + \\sin α \\sin β$\n4. Then we can derive other formulas\n\nBut wait, in this proof, we're using the coordinates $(\\cos α, \\sin α)$, which already assumes we know what sine and cosine are! And the dot product formula $a \\cdot b = |a||b|\\cos θ$ is used to relate the dot product to the cosine of the angle between vectors.\n\nActually, I think the redundancy might be different. The problem asks to prove the formulas, but assumption 3 already gives us a formula involving cosine. If we accept assumption 3, we're already accepting some relationship between angles and trigonometric functions.\n\nLet me reconsider: Is assumption 3 actually redundant? Could we prove the angle addition formulas without it? Yes, there are geometric proofs using Ptolemy's theorem or chord lengths in circles that don't require the dot product formula.\n\nSo perhaps assumption 3 IS redundant because:\n1. We could prove the formulas using pure geometry without vectors\n2. The problem asks for \"intuitive understanding\" which could be geometric\n3. The dot product formula itself relies on understanding of cosine\n\nBut actually, looking at the problem statement again, it seems like assumption 3 is meant to be used as a tool. The problem likely expects a vector-based proof using the dot product.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I should check: The problem has 3 assumptions, and we need to prove trigonometric identities. The most likely redundant assumption is actually assumption 3 because:\n1. α and β being real numbers are necessary for the domain of trigonometric functions\n2. The dot product formula might be considered part of the mathematical framework rather than an explicit assumption\n3. We could state the dot product formula as part of the proof rather than as an assumption\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about what would happen if we remove assumption 3. We would need to prove the angle addition formulas using other geometric methods. This is possible but might be more complex.\n\nActually, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the structure of the problem and typical mathematical proofs, I believe assumption 3 is NOT redundant because it provides the key tool for one of the standard proofs. Without it, we would need different geometric constructions.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider from a different angle. The problem says \"provide an intuitive understanding of these formulas without using Calculus or Euler's formula.\" The dot product approach IS an intuitive geometric understanding. So assumption 3 is providing the geometric framework.\n\nI think the correct answer is that there is NO redundant assumption. All three are needed:\n1. α is real - domain requirement\n2. β is real - domain requirement  \n3. Dot product formula - geometric tool for proof\n\nLet me structure my answer accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"no\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"α is a real number\", \"β is a real number\", \"$a \\\\cdot b = |a| |b| \\\\cos \\\\theta$\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"no\",\n  \"new_problem\": \"no\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"no\"\n}\n```"
