Emergency incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere (Assumption 4).\n\nCase analysis:\n1. Suppose the first emergency incident occurs on the right side of the service area.\n2. Under the closest-ambulance dispatch policy (Assumption 5), ambulance C would be dispatched as it is closest.\n3. Once dispatched, C becomes unavailable (Assumption 6).\n4. Now consider a second emergency incident that occurs before repositioning (Assumption 7), also on the right side (which has positive probability by Assumption 4).\n5. The remaining available ambulances (A and B) are both on the left side, far from the second incident, leading to a long response time.\n\nAlternative strategy:\nFor the first incident on the right side, dispatch ambulance A or B instead of C. This yields a longer response time for the first incident but leaves ambulance C available on the right side.\nIf the second incident then occurs on the right side, ambulance C is available and close, resulting in a short response time.\n\nThe average response time across both incidents under the alternative strategy can be lower than under the closest-ambulance policy, depending on the probabilities and distances. Specifically, let d_CR be distance from C to right-side incident (short), d_AR be distance from A/B to right-side incident (long). Under closest policy: first response = d_CR, second response = d_AR (if second incident on right). Under alternative: first response = d_AR, second response = d_CR (if second incident on right). The average is the same in this symmetric case, but if we consider that second incidents might occur with different probabilities on left vs right, or if distances are not symmetric, the alternative can yield strictly better average.\n\nTherefore, the closest-ambulance dispatch policy does not always minimize the average response time (Assumption 8), proving it is non-optimal compared to alternative strategies that consider future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning.\n"

To show strict improvement is possible, consider a modified scenario:\\nLet the second incident occur at x₂ = 0.9 (near right side) with probability p > 0.5, reflecting higher probability of incidents on the right side.\\n\\nUnder closest policy:\\n- First incident at x₁ = 1: Dispatch C, R₁ᶜ = 0\\n- Second incident at x₂ = 0.9: Dispatch A or B, R₂ᶜ = d(0,0.9) = 0.9\\nExpected average = (0 + 0.9)/2 = 0.45\\n\\nUnder alternative (dispatch A first):\\n- First incident: Dispatch A, R₁ᵃ = 1\\n- Second incident: Dispatch C, R₂ᵃ = d(1,0.9) = 0.1\\nExpected average = (1 + 0.1)/2 = 0.55\\n\\nNow consider weighted average with probability p for right-side second incidents:\\nLet p = probability second incident occurs on right side (x > 0.5).\\n\\nUnder closest policy:\\nE[R]ᶜ = (0 + p·0.9 + (1-p)·1)/2 = (p·0.9 + (1-p))/2\\n\\nUnder alternative:\\nE[R]ᵃ = (1 + p·0.1 + (1-p)·0)/2 = (1 + p·0.1)/2\\n\\nFor p > 5/9 ≈ 0.556: E[R]ᵃ < E[R]ᶜ\\nThus for sufficiently high probability of second incident on right side, the alternative strategy yields strictly lower average response time.\\n\\n**Step 11: Conclusion**\\nWe have constructed scenarios where:\\n1. The closest-ambulance policy yields suboptimal average response time compared to alternative strategies\\n2. An alternative strategy that considers future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning can yield strictly better average response time\\n\\nTherefore, the closest-ambulance dispatch policy does not always minimize average response time across all incidents, proving it is non-optimal compared to strategies that account for system-wide considerations.\"\n}\n```"

The calculation shows that the closest-ambulance policy (0.45) is strictly *better* than the alternative policy (0.55) in this specific case. Therefore, this example fails to prove that the closest-ambulance policy is non-optimal; in fact, it demonstrates its superiority in this instance. The subsequent probabilistic argument is built on this flawed conclusion and is therefore also invalid.\n\nThe proof is incorrect because its central example contradicts its thesis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": false,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"not final:\"\n}\n```"

This yields a longer response time for the first incident but leaves ambulance C available on the right side.\nIf the second incident then occurs on the right side, ambulance C is available and close, resulting in a short response time.\n\nThe average response time across both incidents under the alternative strategy can be lower than under the closest-ambulance policy, depending on the probabilities and distances. Specifically, let d_CR be distance from C to right-side incident (short), d_AR be distance from A/B to right-side incident (long). Under closest policy: first response = d_CR, second response = d_AR (if second incident on right). Under alternative: first response = d_AR, second response = d_CR (if second incident on right). The average is the same in this symmetric case, but if we consider that second incidents might occur with different probabilities on left vs right, or if distances are not symmetric, the alternative can yield strictly better average.\n\nTherefore, the closest-ambulance dispatch policy does not always minimize the average response time (Assumption 8), proving it is non-optimal compared to alternative strategies that consider future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning.\n"

Ambulances A and B are positioned at x = 0 (left side), and ambulance C is positioned at x = 1 (right side). Let d(x,y) = |x-y| denote the distance between points x and y.\n\n**Step 2: First Incident Scenario**\nConsider the first emergency incident occurs at location x₁ = 1 (right side). This occurs with positive probability since incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere in [0,1].\n\n**Step 3: Closest-Ambulance Policy Response**\nUnder the closest-ambulance policy:\n- Distance from A to x₁: d(0,1) = 1\n- Distance from B to x₁: d(0,1) = 1  \n- Distance from C to x₁: d(1,1) = 0\nAmbulance C is closest (distance 0), so C is dispatched to the first incident. Response time for first incident: R₁ᶜ = 0.\nAmbulance C becomes unavailable after dispatch.\n\n**Step 4: Second Incident Scenario**\nA second emergency incident occurs before repositioning, as given in the problem.

To show strict improvement is possible, consider a modified scenario:\nLet the second incident occur at x₂ = 0.9 (near right side) with probability p > 0.5, reflecting higher probability of incidents on the right side.\n\nUnder closest policy:\n- First incident at x₁ = 1: Dispatch C, R₁ᶜ = 0\n- Second incident at x₂ = 0.9: Dispatch A or B, R₂ᶜ = d(0,0.9) = 0.9\nExpected average = (0 + 0.9)/2 = 0.45\n\nUnder alternative (dispatch A first):\n- First incident: Dispatch A, R₁ᵃ = 1\n- Second incident: Dispatch C, R₂ᵃ = d(1,0.9) = 0.1\nExpected average = (1 + 0.1)/2 = 0.55\n\nNow consider weighted average with probability p for right-side second incidents:\nLet p = probability second incident occurs on right side (x > 0.5).\n\nUnder closest policy:\nE[R]ᶜ = (0 + p·0.9 + (1-p)·1)/2 = (p·0.9 + (1-p))/2\n\nUnder alternative:\nE[R]ᵃ = (1 + p·0.1 + (1-p)·0)/2 = (1 + p·0.1)/2\n\nFor p > 5/9 ≈ 0.556: E[R]ᵃ < E[R]ᶜ\nThus for sufficiently high probability of second incident on right side, the alternative strategy yields strictly lower average response time.\n\n**Step 11: Conclusion**\nWe have constructed scenarios where:\n1. The closest-ambulance policy yields suboptimal average response time compared to alternative strategies\n2. An alternative strategy that considers future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning can yield strictly better average response time\n\nTherefore, the closest-ambulance dispatch policy does not always minimize average response time across all incidents, proving it is non-optimal compared to strategies that account for system-wide considerations."

Under the closest-ambulance dispatch policy (Assumption 5), ambulance C would be dispatched as it is closest.\n3. Once dispatched, C becomes unavailable (Assumption 6).\n4. Now consider a second emergency incident that occurs before repositioning (Assumption 7), also on the right side (which has positive probability by Assumption 4).\n5. The remaining available ambulances (A and B) are both on the left side, far from the second incident, leading to a long response time.\n\nAlternative strategy:\nFor the first incident on the right side, dispatch ambulance A or B instead of C. This yields a longer response time for the first incident but leaves ambulance C available on the right side.\nIf the second incident then occurs on the right side, ambulance C is available and close, resulting in a short response time.\n\nThe average response time across both incidents under the alternative strategy can be lower than under the closest-ambulance policy, depending on the probabilities and distances. Specifically, let d_CR be distance from C to right-side incident (short), d_AR be distance from A/B to right-side incident (long). Under closest policy: first response = d_CR, second response = d_AR (if second incident on right). Under alternative: first response = d_AR, second response = d_CR (if second incident on right).

Dispatch C.\n- C becomes unavailable, leaving A and B at x=0.\n- For incident at x₂=0.9: Closest available ambulance is A or B (distance = 0.9).\n- Total response time = 0.4 + 0.9 = 1.3\n- Average response time = 1.3/2 = 0.65\n\nAlternative policy (dispatch A to first incident):\n- For incident at x₁=0.6: Dispatch A (distance = 0.6).\n- A becomes unavailable, leaving B at x=0 and C at x=1.\n- For incident at x₂=0.9: Closest available ambulance is C (distance = 0.1).\n- Total response time = 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.7\n- Average response time = 0.7/2 = 0.35\n\nComparison:\n- Closest-ambulance policy average: 0.65\n- Alternative policy average: 0.35\n\nSince 0.35 < 0.65, the alternative policy yields a lower average response time in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the closest-ambulance dispatch policy does not always minimize the average response time. The policy is non-optimal because it fails to consider how the dispatch decision affects future response capabilities. By sometimes sending a farther ambulance to the first incident, we can preserve better positioning for potential future incidents, resulting in a lower overall average response time.\n\nThis proves that the closest-ambulance policy is non-optimal for minimizing average response time.\n",

Ambulances A and B are positioned at x = 0 (left side), and ambulance C is positioned at x = 1 (right side). Let d(x,y) = |x-y| denote the distance between points x and y.\n\n**Step 2: First Incident Scenario**\nConsider the first emergency incident occurs at location x₁ = 1 (right side). This occurs with positive probability since incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere in [0,1].\n\n**Step 3: Closest-Ambulance Policy Response**\nUnder the closest-ambulance policy:\n- Distance from A to x₁: d(0,1) = 1\n- Distance from B to x₁: d(0,1) = 1  \n- Distance from C to x₁: d(1,1) = 0\nAmbulance C is closest (distance 0), so C is dispatched to the first incident.

Consider the case where the second incident occurs at location x₂ = 1 (right side). This also occurs with positive probability.\n\n**Step 5: Response to Second Incident under Closest Policy**\nAvailable ambulances: A and B (both at x = 0).\n- Distance from A to x₂: d(0,1) = 1\n- Distance from B to x₂: d(0,1) = 1\nEither ambulance is dispatched with response time R₂ᶜ = 1.\n\n**Step 6: Average Response Time under Closest Policy**\nFor this specific sequence of incidents:\nAverage response time = (R₁ᶜ + R₂ᶜ)/2 = (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5\n\n**Step 7: Alternative Strategy**\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy: For the first incident at x₁ = 1, dispatch ambulance A instead of C, despite A not being the closest.\n\n**Step 8: Alternative Strategy Response**\nFirst incident: Dispatch ambulance A.

To show strict improvement is possible, consider a modified scenario:\nLet the second incident occur at x₂ = 0.9 (near right side) with probability p > 0.5, reflecting higher probability of incidents on the right side.\n\nUnder closest policy:\n- First incident at x₁ = 1: Dispatch C, R₁ᶜ = 0\n- Second incident at x₂ = 0.9: Dispatch A or B, R₂ᶜ = d(0,0.9) = 0.9\nExpected average = (0 + 0.9)/2 = 0.45\n\nUnder alternative (dispatch A first):\n- First incident: Dispatch A, R₁ᵃ = 1\n- Second incident: Dispatch C, R₂ᵃ = d(1,0.9) = 0.1\nExpected average = (1 + 0.1)/2 = 0.55\n\nNow consider weighted average with probability p for right-side second incidents:\nLet p = probability second incident occurs on right side (x > 0.5).\n\nUnder closest policy:\nE[R]ᶜ = (0 + p·0.9 + (1-p)·1)/2 = (p·0.9 + (1-p))/2\n\nUnder alternative:\nE[R]ᵃ = (1 + p·0.1 + (1-p)·0)/2 = (1 + p·0.1)/2\n\nFor p > 5/9 ≈ 0.556: E[R]ᵃ < E[R]ᶜ\nThus for sufficiently high probability of second incident on right side, the alternative strategy yields strictly lower average response time.\n\n**Step 11: Conclusion**\nWe have constructed scenarios where:\n1. The closest-ambulance policy yields suboptimal average response time compared to alternative strategies\n2.

Total response time under closest-ambulance policy:\n   - First incident: 0.4\n   - Second incident: 0.9\n   - Total: 0.4 + 0.9 = 1.3\n   - Average: 1.3/2 = 0.65\n\n**Alternative Policy Analysis:**\nConsider an alternative strategy: dispatch ambulance A (not the closest) to the first incident.\n\n1.

        "final reviewer": "My review of the proof is as follows.\n\nThe proof attempts to demonstrate by counterexample that the closest-ambulance dispatch policy is non-optimal. It sets up a scenario with ambulances A and B at x=0 and C at x=1.\n\nIn Step 10, it considers a sequence of two incidents: the first at x₁=1 and the second at x₂=0.9.\n\nIt correctly calculates the average response time for the two policies in this scenario:\n1.  **Closest-Ambulance Policy:**\n    *   Incident 1 (x₁=1): Dispatch C. Response time = 0.\n    *   Incident 2 (x₂=0.9): Dispatch A or B.

However, it draws the wrong conclusion from its own results. The calculation shows that the closest-ambulance policy (0.45) is strictly *better* than the alternative policy (0.55) in this specific case. Therefore, this example fails to prove that the closest-ambulance policy is non-optimal; in fact, it demonstrates its superiority in this instance. The subsequent probabilistic argument is built on this flawed conclusion and is therefore also invalid.\n\nThe proof is incorrect because its central example contradicts its thesis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": false,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"not final:\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": true,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:**\nConsider a scenario with three ambulances: ambulances A and B are stationed at position x=0, and ambulance C is stationed at position x=1. Emergency incidents occur at random locations on the interval [0,1], one at a time. When an incident occurs, an ambulance must be dispatched immediately from the available ambulances (those not currently responding to an incident). The goal is to minimize the average response time to incidents. Prove that the policy of always dispatching the closest available ambulance to each incident does NOT always minimize the average response time.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe will prove that the closest-ambulance dispatch policy is non-optimal by constructing a specific counterexample where an alternative dispatch strategy yields a lower average response time.\n\n**Setup:**\n- Three ambulances: A and B stationed at x=0, C stationed at x=1.\n- Two consecutive incidents occur: first at x₁=0.6, second at x₂=0.9.\n- Response time for an ambulance at position `a` to an incident at position `x` is `|x-a|`.\n- The average response time is the sum of the response times for the two incidents, divided by two.\n\n**Case 1: Closest-Ambulance Policy**\n\n1.  **First Incident at x₁=0.6:**\n    *   The distances from the available ambulances are:\n        *   Ambulance A (at x=0): |0.6 - 0| = 0.6\n        *   Ambulance B (at x=0): |0.6 - 0| = 0.6\n        *   Ambulance C (at x=1): |0.6 - 1| = 0.4\n    *   The closest ambulance is C. It is dispatched. The response time is 0.4.\n    *   Ambulances A and B remain available at x=0.\n\n2.  **Second Incident at x₂=0.9:**\n    *   The distances from the available ambulances (A and B) are:\n        *   Ambulance A (at x=0): |0.9 - 0| = 0.9\n        *   Ambulance B (at x=0): |0.9 - 0| = 0.9\n    *   Either A or B is dispatched. The response time is 0.9.\n\n3.  **Average Response Time:**\n    *   The total response time is 0.4 + 0.9 = 1.3.\n    *   The average response time is 1.3 / 2 = 0.65.\n\n**Case 2: Alternative Policy**\n\n1.  **First Incident at x₁=0.6:**\n    *   Instead of dispatching the closest ambulance (C), we dispatch ambulance A.\n    *   The response time is |0.6 - 0| = 0.6.\n    *   Ambulances B (at x=0) and C (at x=1) remain available.\n\n2.  **Second Incident at x₂=0.9:**\n    *   The distances from the available ambulances (B and C) are:\n        *   Ambulance B (at x=0): |0.9 - 0| = 0.9\n        *   Ambulance C (at x=1): |0.9 - 1| = 0.1\n    *   The closest available ambulance is C.

The response time is 0.1.\n\n3.  **Average Response Time:**\n    *   The total response time is 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.7.\n    *   The average response time is 0.7 / 2 = 0.35.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe average response time for the closest-ambulance policy is 0.65, while the average response time for the alternative policy is 0.35. Since 0.35 < 0.65, the alternative policy is superior for this sequence of incidents.\n\nTherefore, we have shown through a counterexample that the policy of always dispatching the closest available ambulance does not always minimize the average response time.\n\nfinal:"
