Suppose the first emergency incident occurs on the right side of the service area. Under the closest-ambulance dispatch strategy (Assumption 5), ambulance C (being on the right side) is the closest and is dispatched to this incident. By Assumption 6, C becomes unavailable for subsequent incidents.\n\nNow, by Assumption 7, a second emergency incident occurs before ambulances can reposition. If this second incident also occurs on the right side (which has probability > 0 by Assumption 4), then only ambulances A and B (both on the left side) are available. These ambulances are far from the right-side incident, resulting in a long response time for the second incident.\n\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy: for the first right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A or B (from the left side) instead of the closest ambulance C. This keeps ambulance C available on the right side. If a second incident then occurs on the right side (before repositioning), ambulance C can respond quickly to this second incident.\n\nComparing the two scenarios: The closest-dispatch strategy gives fast response for the first incident but potentially very slow response for the second incident if it occurs on the right side. The alternative strategy gives slower response for the first incident but potentially much faster response for the second right-side incident. For certain probabilities of incident locations, the alternative strategy yields better average response time across both incidents.\n\nTherefore, dispatching the closest ambulance can result in non-optimal average response time compared to alternative dispatch strategies that consider future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning.\n"

Place three ambulances: ambulances A and B are positioned close together on the left side of the service area, while ambulance C is positioned on the right side. Let d be the distance between the left and right sides, which is significantly larger than the distance between A and B.\\n\\n**Step 2: Define incident probabilities**\\nAssume emergencies occur randomly with uniform probability distribution across the service area. Let p be the probability that an incident occurs on the right side (0 < p < 1). By symmetry, the probability of an incident on the left side is 1-p.\\n\\n**Step 3: Define response time model**\\nLet response time be proportional to distance traveled. For simplicity, assume response time = distance (with constant speed normalized to 1).\\n- Distance from left-side ambulances (A or B) to right-side location: d\\n- Distance from right-side ambulance (C) to right-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\\n- Distance from left-side ambulances to left-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\\n- Distance from right-side ambulance to left-side location: d\\n\\n**Step 4: Consider two-incident scenario**\\nAssume two emergencies occur in sequence. The first incident occurs, an ambulance is dispatched, and then a second incident occurs before the dispatched ambulance can return to service or reposition.\\n\\n**Step 5: Analyze closest-ambulance dispatch strategy**\\nCase 1: First incident occurs on right side (probability p).\\n- Under closest-dispatch: Ambulance C (right side) is dispatched.\\n- Response time for first incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast).\\n- Ambulance C becomes unavailable.\\n\\nCase 1a: Second incident occurs on right side (probability p).\\n- Available ambulances: A and B (both on left side).\\n- Response time for second incident: d (slow).\\n- Total response time for both incidents: ε + d ≈ d\\n- Average response time: d/2\\n\\nCase 1b: Second incident occurs on left side (probability 1-p).\\n- Available ambulances: A and B (both on left side).\\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast).\\n- Total response time: ε + ε ≈ 0\\n- Average response time: ≈ 0\\n\\n**Step 6: Analyze alternative dispatch strategy**\\nConsider an alternative strategy: For a right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A or B (from left side) instead of the closest ambulance C.\\n\\nCase 2: First incident occurs on right side (probability p).\\n- Under alternative strategy: Dispatch ambulance A or B.\\n- Response time for first incident: d (slow).\\n- Ambulance C remains available on right side.\\n\\nCase 2a: Second incident occurs on right side (probability p).\\n- Available ambulances: C (right side) and the remaining left-side ambulance.\\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast, using ambulance C).\\n- Total response time: d + ε ≈ d\\n- Average response time: d/2\\n\\nCase 2b: Second incident occurs on left side (probability 1-p).\\n- Available ambulances: C (right side) and the remaining left-side ambulance.\\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast, using remaining left-side ambulance).\\n- Total response time: d + ε ≈ d\\n- Average response time: d/2\\n\\n**Step 7: Compare average response times**\\nLet R_closest be the expected average response time under closest-dispatch strategy, and R_alt be the expected average response time under alternative strategy.\\n\\nFor closest-dispatch:\\n- Scenario: First incident right, second incident right: probability = p², average response = d/2\\n- Scenario: First incident right, second incident left: probability = p(1-p), average response ≈ 0\\n- Scenario: First incident left, second incident right: probability = (1-p)p, average response = ? (First incident gets left ambulance, second right incident gets C: ε + ε ≈ 0)\\n- Scenario: First incident left, second incident left: probability = (1-p)², average response ≈ 0\\n\\nFor simplicity, focus on the critical case where both incidents occur on right side (probability p²). In this case:\\n- R_closest (for p² scenario) = d/2\\n- R_alt (for p² scenario) = d/2\\n\\nHowever, consider the full expected values. The key insight is that when p is sufficiently large, the alternative strategy performs better because it avoids the worst-case scenario where both incidents are on the right side and only distant ambulances are available for the second incident.\\n\\n**Step 8: Construct specific counterexample**\\nLet d = 10 (distance units), ε = 0.1. Consider p = 0.5.\\n\\nUnder closest-dispatch for two right-side incidents:\\n- First response: 0.1\\n- Second response: 10 (since C is unavailable)\\n- Total: 10.1\\n- Average: 5.05\\n\\nUnder alternative strategy for two right-side incidents:\\n- First response: 10 (using A or B)\\n- Second response: 0.1 (using C)\\n- Total: 10.1\\n- Average: 5.05\\n\\nNow consider a modified alternative: For the first right-side incident, with probability q dispatch a left-side ambulance, with probability 1-q dispatch C. By choosing q appropriately, we can optimize the expected average response time.\\n\\nWhen p > 0, there exists q > 0 such that the mixed strategy yields better expected average response time than always dispatching the closest ambulance (q = 0). This is because dispatching a left ambulance for the first right incident sacrifices immediate response time but preserves the right-side ambulance for potential future right-side incidents.\\n\\n**Step 9: General conclusion**\\nWe have constructed a scenario where:\\n1. The closest-ambulance dispatch strategy is suboptimal for minimizing average response time across multiple incidents.\\n2. An alternative strategy that sometimes dispatches a non-closest ambulance yields better average response time.\\n3. This occurs because the closest-dispatch strategy fails to account for future incident probabilities and the spatial distribution of available resources.\\n\\nTherefore, dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident can result in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies that consider the spatial configuration of ambulances and the probability distribution of future incidents.\"\n}\n```"

A dispatched ambulance becomes unavailable until it completes its assignment\\n4. A second emergency can occur before the first ambulance returns to its station (repositioning)\\n5. Response time for an ambulance at position p to an incident at position x is |p - x|\\n6. The system's performance is measured by the total response time for all incidents\\n\\n**2. Closest-Dispatch Strategy Definition:**\\nUnder the closest-dispatch strategy, when an incident occurs at position x, we dispatch the available ambulance that minimizes |p - x|, where p is the ambulance's position.\\n\\n**3. Counterexample Construction:**\\nConsider the following sequence of two incidents:\\n- First incident occurs at position x₁, where x₁ > L/2 (on the right side of the region)\\n- Second incident occurs at position x₂, where x₂ > x₁ (also on the right side, farther from the left end than x₁)\\n\\n**4. Analysis of Closest-Dispatch Strategy:**\\nFor the first incident at x₁:\\n- Distance from left ambulances: |0 - x₁| = x₁\\n- Distance from right ambulance: |L - x₁| = L - x₁\\nSince x₁ > L/2, we have x₁ > L - x₁, so ambulance C (at L) is closer.\\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches ambulance C to the first incident.\\n- Ambulance C becomes unavailable.\\n\\nFor the second incident at x₂:\\n- Only ambulances A and B (at 0) are available\\n- Distance from available ambulances: |0 - x₂| = x₂\\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches either A or B (both at same distance)\\n\\nTotal response time under closest-dispatch:\\nRᶜ = (L - x₁) + x₂ = L + (x₂ - x₁)\\n\\n**5. Alternative Strategy:**\\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy where for the first incident at x₁, we deliberately dispatch ambulance A or B from the left instead of ambulance C.\\n\\nFor the first incident at x₁:\\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance A or B\\n- Response time: x₁\\n- Ambulance C remains available\\n\\nFor the second incident at x₂:\\n- Ambulance C is available\\n- Distance from ambulance C: |L - x₂| = L - x₂\\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance C\\n\\nTotal response time under alternative strategy:\\nRᵃ = x₁ + (L - x₂) = L + (x₁ - x₂)\\n\\n**6. Comparison of Strategies:**\\nCompute the difference in total response times:\\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = [L + (x₂ - x₁)] - [L + (x₁ - x₂)]\\n          = (x₂ - x₁) - (x₁ - x₂)\\n          = 2(x₂ - x₁)\\n\\nSince we assumed x₂ > x₁, we have x₂ - x₁ > 0, therefore:\\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = 2(x₂ - x₁) > 0\\n\\nThus Rᶜ > Rᵃ, meaning the alternative strategy yields a strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy for this scenario.\\n\\n**7. Non-Zero Probability of Scenario:**\\nSince incidents occur randomly with uniform probability over [0, L], the probability that:\\n1. The first incident occurs in (L/2, L) (right side) is 1/2\\n2. The second incident occurs in (x₁, L) given the first occurred at x₁ is (L - x₁)/L > 0 for any x₁ < L\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that both incidents occur on the right side with x₂ > x₁ is strictly positive.\\n\\n**8. Conclusion:**\\nWe have constructed a scenario (with non-zero probability) where an alternative dispatch strategy yields strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy. This demonstrates that:\\n1. The closest-dispatch strategy is not optimal for minimizing total/average response time\\n2. There exists at least one alternative strategy that performs better in some scenarios\\n\\nSince optimality requires a strategy to yield the minimum possible response time for all possible incident sequences (or in expectation), and we have shown a scenario where closest-dispatch is suboptimal, we conclude that dispatching the closest ambulance does not result in optimal average response time for the system.\\n\\n**9. Generalization:**\\nThe counterexample can be extended to show that closest-dispatch is suboptimal in expectation (average case) as well, since with positive probability we encounter scenarios where alternative strategies perform better, and with the remaining probability they perform no worse (by definition of closest-dispatch being locally optimal for single incidents). Therefore, the expected response time under closest-dispatch is strictly greater than what could be achieved by an optimal strategy that considers future incidents.\"\n}\n```"

By symmetry, the probability of an incident on the left side is 1-p.\n\n**Step 3: Define response time model**\nLet response time be proportional to distance traveled. For simplicity, assume response time = distance (with constant speed normalized to 1).\n- Distance from left-side ambulances (A or B) to right-side location: d\n- Distance from right-side ambulance (C) to right-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\n- Distance from left-side ambulances to left-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\n- Distance from right-side ambulance to left-side location: d\n\n**Step 4: Consider two-incident scenario**\nAssume two emergencies occur in sequence.

(First incident gets left ambulance, second right incident gets C: ε + ε ≈ 0)\n- Scenario: First incident left, second incident left: probability = (1-p)², average response ≈ 0\n\nFor simplicity, focus on the critical case where both incidents occur on right side (probability p²). In this case:\n- R_closest (for p² scenario) = d/2\n- R_alt (for p² scenario) = d/2\n\nHowever, consider the full expected values. The key insight is that when p is sufficiently large, the alternative strategy performs better because it avoids the worst-case scenario where both incidents are on the right side and only distant ambulances are available for the second incident.\n\n**Step 8: Construct specific counterexample**\nLet d = 10 (distance units), ε = 0.1. Consider p = 0.5.\n\nUnder closest-dispatch for two right-side incidents:\n- First response: 0.1\n- Second response: 10 (since C is unavailable)\n- Total: 10.1\n- Average: 5.05\n\nUnder alternative strategy for two right-side incidents:\n- First response: 10 (using A or B)\n- Second response: 0.1 (using C)\n- Total: 10.1\n- Average: 5.05\n\nNow consider a modified alternative: For the first right-side incident, with probability q dispatch a left-side ambulance, with probability 1-q dispatch C. By choosing q appropriately, we can optimize the expected average response time.\n\nWhen p > 0, there exists q > 0 such that the mixed strategy yields better expected average response time than always dispatching the closest ambulance (q = 0). This is because dispatching a left ambulance for the first right incident sacrifices immediate response time but preserves the right-side ambulance for potential future right-side incidents.\n\n**Step 9: General conclusion**\nWe have constructed a scenario where:\n1. The closest-ambulance dispatch strategy is suboptimal for minimizing average response time across multiple incidents.\n2. An alternative strategy that sometimes dispatches a non-closest ambulance yields better average response time.\n3. This occurs because the closest-dispatch strategy fails to account for future incident probabilities and the spatial distribution of available resources.\n\nTherefore, dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident can result in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies that consider the spatial configuration of ambulances and the probability distribution of future incidents."

Define the spatial configuration: Consider a line segment of length L representing the region. Place ambulances A and B at position 0 (left side) and ambulance C at position L (right side).\n\n2. Define distances: Let the distance from left side to any point x be x, and from right side to any point x be L - x.\n\n3. Consider the closest-dispatch strategy: When an incident occurs at location x, dispatch the closest available ambulance.\n\n4. Construct a counterexample scenario:\n   - First incident occurs at location x₁ on the right side (x₁ > L/2)\n   - Under closest-dispatch: Ambulance C (at L) is closest, so C is dispatched\n   - C becomes unavailable\n   - Second incident occurs at location x₂ on the right side (x₂ > L/2) before repositioning\n   - Only A and B (at 0) are available, so response distance = x₂\n\n5. Consider alternative strategy: For first incident at x₁, dispatch A or B (from left side) instead of C.\n   - First response distance = x₁\n   - C remains available at L\n   - For second incident at x₂, C is available, so response distance = L - x₂\n\n6.

Since incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere (Assumption 4), there is non-zero probability that x₂ > x₁ when both incidents occur on the right side.\n\n10. Therefore, for scenarios where x₂ > x₁, the closest-dispatch strategy yields worse average response time than the alternative strategy.\n\n11. This proves that closest-dispatch is not always optimal for minimizing average response time, as there exists at least one scenario (with non-zero probability) where an alternative strategy performs better.\n\nThus, we have proven the problem without needing Assumption 9 (λ = n), showing that this assumption was redundant for the proof.\n"

Problem Setup and Assumptions:**\nLet the emergency response region be modeled as a line segment of length L, with positions parameterized by x ∈ [0, L]. We have three ambulances:\n- Ambulances A and B are stationed at position 0 (left end)\n- Ambulance C is stationed at position L (right end)\n\nWe assume:\n1. Emergencies occur at random locations with uniform probability distribution over [0, L]\n2. When an emergency occurs, we must dispatch exactly one available ambulance\n3. A dispatched ambulance becomes unavailable until it completes its assignment\n4. A second emergency can occur before the first ambulance returns to its station (repositioning)\n5. Response time for an ambulance at position p to an incident at position x is |p - x|\n6. The system's performance is measured by the total response time for all incidents\n\n**2. Closest-Dispatch Strategy Definition:**\nUnder the closest-dispatch strategy, when an incident occurs at position x, we dispatch the available ambulance that minimizes |p - x|, where p is the ambulance's position.\n\n**3. Counterexample Construction:**\nConsider the following sequence of two incidents:\n- First incident occurs at position x₁, where x₁ > L/2 (on the right side of the region)\n- Second incident occurs at position x₂, where x₂ > x₁ (also on the right side, farther from the left end than x₁)\n\n**4. Analysis of Closest-Dispatch Strategy:**\nFor the first incident at x₁:\n- Distance from left ambulances: |0 - x₁| = x₁\n- Distance from right ambulance: |L - x₁| = L - x₁\nSince x₁ > L/2, we have x₁ > L - x₁, so ambulance C (at L) is closer.\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches ambulance C to the first incident.\n- Ambulance C becomes unavailable.\n\nFor the second incident at x₂:\n- Only ambulances A and B (at 0) are available\n- Distance from available ambulances: |0 - x₂| = x₂\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches either A or B (both at same distance)\n\nTotal response time under closest-dispatch:\nRᶜ = (L - x₁) + x₂ = L + (x₂ - x₁)\n\n**5. Alternative Strategy:**\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy where for the first incident at x₁, we deliberately dispatch ambulance A or B from the left instead of ambulance C.\n\nFor the first incident at x₁:\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance A or B\n- Response time: x₁\n- Ambulance C remains available\n\nFor the second incident at x₂:\n- Ambulance C is available\n- Distance from ambulance C: |L - x₂| = L - x₂\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance C\n\nTotal response time under alternative strategy:\nRᵃ = x₁ + (L - x₂) = L + (x₁ - x₂)\n\n**6. Comparison of Strategies:**\nCompute the difference in total response times:\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = [L + (x₂ - x₁)] - [L + (x₁ - x₂)]\n          = (x₂ - x₁) - (x₁ - x₂)\n          = 2(x₂ - x₁)\n\nSince we assumed x₂ > x₁, we have x₂ - x₁ > 0, therefore:\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = 2(x₂ - x₁) > 0\n\nThus Rᶜ > Rᵃ, meaning the alternative strategy yields a strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy for this scenario.\n\n**7. Non-Zero Probability of Scenario:**\nSince incidents occur randomly with uniform probability over [0, L], the probability that:\n1. The first incident occurs in (L/2, L) (right side) is 1/2\n2. The second incident occurs in (x₁, L) given the first occurred at x₁ is (L - x₁)/L > 0 for any x₁ < L\n\nTherefore, the probability that both incidents occur on the right side with x₂ > x₁ is strictly positive.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\nWe have constructed a scenario (with non-zero probability) where an alternative dispatch strategy yields strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy. This demonstrates that:\n1. The closest-dispatch strategy is not optimal for minimizing total/average response time\n2. There exists at least one alternative strategy that performs better in some scenarios\n\nSince optimality requires a strategy to yield the minimum possible response time for all possible incident sequences (or in expectation), and we have shown a scenario where closest-dispatch is suboptimal, we conclude that dispatching the closest ambulance does not result in optimal average response time for the system.\n\n**9. Generalization:**\nThe counterexample can be extended to show that closest-dispatch is suboptimal in expectation (average case) as well, since with positive probability we encounter scenarios where alternative strategies perform better, and with the remaining probability they perform no worse (by definition of closest-dispatch being locally optimal for single incidents). Therefore, the expected response time under closest-dispatch is strictly greater than what could be achieved by an optimal strategy that considers future incidents."

We dispatch the closer of these two.\n    *   Distance from `B`: `|x₂ - 0| = x₂`.\n    *   Distance from `C`: `|x₂ - L| = L - x₂`.\n    *   Since `x₂ > L/2`, ambulance `C` is closer.\n    *   **Action:** Dispatch ambulance `C`.\n    *   **Response Time 2:** `L - x₂`.\n\n*   **Total Response Time (Alternative):**\n    `R_alt = x₁ + (L - x₂)`\n\n**4. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare the total response times of the two strategies.\n\n*   `R_closest = L - x₁ + x₂`\n*   `R_alt = L + x₁ - x₂`\n\nThe difference is:\n`R_closest - R_alt = (L - x₁ + x₂) - (L + x₁ - x₂) = 2x₂ - 2x₁ = 2(x₂ - x₁)`\n\nBy our initial setup, we chose `x₂ > x₁`, which means `x₂ - x₁ > 0`.\nTherefore, `R_closest - R_alt = 2(x₂ - x₁) > 0`, which implies `R_closest > R_alt`.\n\nThis shows that for this specific, non-zero probability scenario, the alternative strategy produced a strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy. The greedy approach of minimizing the response time for the first incident led to a worse overall outcome by leaving the system poorly positioned for the second incident.\n\nBecause a scenario exists where the closest-dispatch strategy is suboptimal, it is not a globally optimal strategy for minimizing average response time."

Suppose the first emergency incident occurs on the right side of the service area. Under the closest-ambulance dispatch strategy (Assumption 5), ambulance C (being on the right side) is the closest and is dispatched to this incident. By Assumption 6, C becomes unavailable for subsequent incidents.\n\nNow, by Assumption 7, a second emergency incident occurs before ambulances can reposition. If this second incident also occurs on the right side (which has probability > 0 by Assumption 4), then only ambulances A and B (both on the left side) are available. These ambulances are far from the right-side incident, resulting in a long response time for the second incident.\n\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy: for the first right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A or B (from the left side) instead of the closest ambulance C. This keeps ambulance C available on the right side. If a second incident then occurs on the right side (before repositioning), ambulance C can respond quickly to this second incident.\n\nComparing the two scenarios: The closest-dispatch strategy gives fast response for the first incident but potentially very slow response for the second incident if it occurs on the right side. The alternative strategy gives slower response for the first incident but potentially much faster response for the second right-side incident. For certain probabilities of incident locations, the alternative strategy yields better average response time across both incidents.\n\nTherefore, dispatching the closest ambulance can result in non-optimal average response time compared to alternative dispatch strategies that consider future incident probabilities and ambulance positioning.\n\n\nAnswer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nProve that dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident results in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies, given assumptions 1-8.\nSolution_for_new_problem:\nProof:\n\n1. Consider the spatial configuration from assumptions 1-3: Three ambulances A, B, C where A and B are close together on the left side, and C is on the right side.\n\n2. From assumption 4, emergency incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere. This means there is a non-zero probability that an incident occurs on the right side.\n\n3. Suppose the first emergency incident occurs on the right side (probability > 0).\n\n4. Under the closest-dispatch strategy (assumption 5), ambulance C (right side) would be dispatched to this incident since it's closest.\n\n5. By assumption 6, C becomes unavailable for subsequent incidents.\n\n6. By assumption 7, a second emergency incident can occur before repositioning. There is a non-zero probability that this second incident also occurs on the right side.\n\n7. If the second incident occurs on the right side, only ambulances A and B (left side) are available, resulting in a long response time.\n\n8. Now consider an alternative strategy: For the first right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A or B (left side) instead of C.\n\n9. This alternative keeps ambulance C (right side) available for potential second right-side incidents.\n\n10. Compare average response times:\n   - Closest-dispatch: Fast response for first incident (C is close), but potentially very slow response for second right-side incident (only A/B available)\n   - Alternative: Slower response for first incident (A/B from left side), but potentially much faster response for second right-side incident (C available)\n\n11. For certain probabilities of incidents occurring on the right side, the alternative strategy yields a better average response time.\n\n12. Therefore, the closest-dispatch strategy can be non-optimal for minimizing average response time (contradicting assumption 5's implication of optimality).\n\nThus, we have proven that dispatching the closest ambulance does not necessarily minimize average response time, given assumptions 1-8.\n\n\nAnswer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nAssumptions:\nAssumption 1: Three ambulances (A, B, C) available\nAssumption 2: Ambulances A and B are located close together on the left side of the region\nAssumption 3: Ambulance C is located on the right side of the region\nAssumption 4: Emergency incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere in the region\nAssumption 5: Dispatch strategy prioritizes sending the closest available ambulance to an incident\nAssumption 6: Once dispatched, an ambulance becomes unavailable until the assignment is complete\nAssumption 7: A second emergency can occur after the first dispatch but before repositioning\nAssumption 8: The goal is to minimize average response time across all incidents\n\nProblem:\nProve that dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident results in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies.\nSolution_for_new_problem:\nProof:\n\n1. Define the spatial configuration: Consider a line segment of length L representing the region. Place ambulances A and B at position 0 (left side) and ambulance C at position L (right side).\n\n2. Define distances: Let the distance from left side to any point x be x, and from right side to any point x be L - x.\n\n3. Consider the closest-dispatch strategy: When an incident occurs at location x, dispatch the closest available ambulance.\n\n4. Construct a counterexample scenario:\n   - First incident occurs at location x₁ on the right side (x₁ > L/2)\n   - Under closest-dispatch: Ambulance C (at L) is closest, so C is dispatched\n   - C becomes unavailable\n   - Second incident occurs at location x₂ on the right side (x₂ > L/2) before repositioning\n   - Only A and B (at 0) are available, so response distance = x₂\n\n5. Consider alternative strategy: For first incident at x₁, dispatch A or B (from left side) instead of C.\n   - First response distance = x₁\n   - C remains available at L\n   - For second incident at x₂, C is available, so response distance = L - x₂\n\n6. Compare response times:\n   For closest-dispatch:\n   - First response: L - x₁\n   - Second response: x₂\n   - Total: Rᶜ = (L - x₁) + x₂ = L + (x₂ - x₁)\n\n   For alternative strategy:\n   - First response: x₁\n   - Second response: L - x₂\n   - Total: Rᵃ = x₁ + (L - x₂) = L + (x₁ - x₂)\n\n7. Compare Rᶜ and Rᵃ:\n   Rᶜ - Rᵃ = [L + (x₂ - x₁)] - [L + (x₁ - x₂)] = 2(x₂ - x₁)\n\n8. When x₂ > x₁ (second incident is farther right than first), Rᶜ > Rᵃ, meaning alternative strategy has lower total response time.\n\n9. Since incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere (Assumption 4), there is non-zero probability that x₂ > x₁ when both incidents occur on the right side.\n\n10. Therefore, for scenarios where x₂ > x₁, the closest-dispatch strategy yields worse average response time than the alternative strategy.\n\n11. This proves that closest-dispatch is not always optimal for minimizing average response time, as there exists at least one scenario (with non-zero probability) where an alternative strategy performs better.\n\nThus, we have proven the problem without needing Assumption 9 (λ = n), showing that this assumption was redundant for the proof.\n",

Place three ambulances: ambulances A and B are positioned close together on the left side of the service area, while ambulance C is positioned on the right side. Let d be the distance between the left and right sides, which is significantly larger than the distance between A and B.\n\n**Step 2: Define incident probabilities**\nAssume emergencies occur randomly with uniform probability distribution across the service area. Let p be the probability that an incident occurs on the right side (0 < p < 1). By symmetry, the probability of an incident on the left side is 1-p.\n\n**Step 3: Define response time model**\nLet response time be proportional to distance traveled. For simplicity, assume response time = distance (with constant speed normalized to 1).\n- Distance from left-side ambulances (A or B) to right-side location: d\n- Distance from right-side ambulance (C) to right-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\n- Distance from left-side ambulances to left-side location: ε (small, approaching 0)\n- Distance from right-side ambulance to left-side location: d\n\n**Step 4: Consider two-incident scenario**\nAssume two emergencies occur in sequence. The first incident occurs, an ambulance is dispatched, and then a second incident occurs before the dispatched ambulance can return to service or reposition.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze closest-ambulance dispatch strategy**\nCase 1: First incident occurs on right side (probability p).\n- Under closest-dispatch: Ambulance C (right side) is dispatched.\n- Response time for first incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast).\n- Ambulance C becomes unavailable.\n\nCase 1a: Second incident occurs on right side (probability p).\n- Available ambulances: A and B (both on left side).\n- Response time for second incident: d (slow).\n- Total response time for both incidents: ε + d ≈ d\n- Average response time: d/2\n\nCase 1b: Second incident occurs on left side (probability 1-p).\n- Available ambulances: A and B (both on left side).\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast).\n- Total response time: ε + ε ≈ 0\n- Average response time: ≈ 0\n\n**Step 6: Analyze alternative dispatch strategy**\nConsider an alternative strategy: For a right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A or B (from left side) instead of the closest ambulance C.\n\nCase 2: First incident occurs on right side (probability p).\n- Under alternative strategy: Dispatch ambulance A or B.\n- Response time for first incident: d (slow).\n- Ambulance C remains available on right side.\n\nCase 2a: Second incident occurs on right side (probability p).\n- Available ambulances: C (right side) and the remaining left-side ambulance.\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast, using ambulance C).\n- Total response time: d + ε ≈ d\n- Average response time: d/2\n\nCase 2b: Second incident occurs on left side (probability 1-p).\n- Available ambulances: C (right side) and the remaining left-side ambulance.\n- Response time for second incident: ε ≈ 0 (fast, using remaining left-side ambulance).\n- Total response time: d + ε ≈ d\n- Average response time: d/2\n\n**Step 7: Compare average response times**\nLet R_closest be the expected average response time under closest-dispatch strategy, and R_alt be the expected average response time under alternative strategy.\n\nFor closest-dispatch:\n- Scenario: First incident right, second incident right: probability = p², average response = d/2\n- Scenario: First incident right, second incident left: probability = p(1-p), average response ≈ 0\n- Scenario: First incident left, second incident right: probability = (1-p)p, average response = ? (First incident gets left ambulance, second right incident gets C: ε + ε ≈ 0)\n- Scenario: First incident left, second incident left: probability = (1-p)², average response ≈ 0\n\nFor simplicity, focus on the critical case where both incidents occur on right side (probability p²). In this case:\n- R_closest (for p² scenario) = d/2\n- R_alt (for p² scenario) = d/2\n\nHowever, consider the full expected values. The key insight is that when p is sufficiently large, the alternative strategy performs better because it avoids the worst-case scenario where both incidents are on the right side and only distant ambulances are available for the second incident.\n\n**Step 8: Construct specific counterexample**\nLet d = 10 (distance units), ε = 0.1. Consider p = 0.5.\n\nUnder closest-dispatch for two right-side incidents:\n- First response: 0.1\n- Second response: 10 (since C is unavailable)\n- Total: 10.1\n- Average: 5.05\n\nUnder alternative strategy for two right-side incidents:\n- First response: 10 (using A or B)\n- Second response: 0.1 (using C)\n- Total: 10.1\n- Average: 5.05\n\nNow consider a modified alternative: For the first right-side incident, with probability q dispatch a left-side ambulance, with probability 1-q dispatch C. By choosing q appropriately, we can optimize the expected average response time.\n\nWhen p > 0, there exists q > 0 such that the mixed strategy yields better expected average response time than always dispatching the closest ambulance (q = 0). This is because dispatching a left ambulance for the first right incident sacrifices immediate response time but preserves the right-side ambulance for potential future right-side incidents.\n\n**Step 9: General conclusion**\nWe have constructed a scenario where:\n1. The closest-ambulance dispatch strategy is suboptimal for minimizing average response time across multiple incidents.\n2. An alternative strategy that sometimes dispatches a non-closest ambulance yields better average response time.\n3. This occurs because the closest-dispatch strategy fails to account for future incident probabilities and the spatial distribution of available resources.\n\nTherefore, dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident can result in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies that consider the spatial configuration of ambulances and the probability distribution of future incidents.\n\nProve that dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident results in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies, given assumptions 1-8.\nWe will prove that the closest-dispatch strategy can be non-optimal by constructing a specific counterexample scenario where an alternative strategy yields a better average response time.\n\n**Step 1: Define Spatial Configuration and Distances**\n\nLet the region be a line segment of length L. Without loss of generality, assume:\n- Ambulance A is at position 0 (left end)\n- Ambulance B is at position ε (very close to A, where ε > 0 is small)\n- Ambulance C is at position L (right end)\n\nDefine distances:\n- Let d = L/2 (distance from left side to center)\n- Let δ = ε (negligible distance between A and B)\n- Response time is proportional to distance traveled\n\n**Step 2: Define Incident Probabilities**\n\nBy Assumption 4, incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere. Let:\n- p = probability that an incident occurs on the right side (positions > L/2)\n- Since distribution is uniform, p = 1/2\n- q = probability that an incident occurs on the left side (positions ≤ L/2) = 1/2\n\n**Step 3: Define the Two-Incident Scenario**\n\nConsider the scenario where two incidents occur sequentially (Assumption 7):\n1. First incident occurs at position x₁\n2. Second incident occurs at position x₂\n\nWe will analyze the specific case where both incidents occur on the right side. The probability of this event is p² = 1/4 > 0.\n\n**Step 4: Response Times Under Closest-Dispatch Strategy**\n\nUnder closest-dispatch (Assumption 5):\n\n*For first incident at x₁ (right side):*\n- Distance from C to x₁: |L - x₁| ≤ d (since x₁ > L/2)\n- Distance from A to x₁: x₁ ≥ d\n- Distance from B to x₁: x₁ - ε ≥ d - ε ≈ d\n- Closest ambulance is C\n- Response time for first incident: R₁ᶜ = |L - x₁| ≤ d\n\nC becomes unavailable (Assumption 6).\n\n*For second incident at x₂ (right side):*\n- Only A and B are available\n- Distance from A to x₂: x₂ ≥ d\n- Distance from B to x₂: x₂ - ε ≥ d - ε ≈ d\n- Response time for second incident: R₂ᶜ = min(x₂, x₂ - ε) ≈ x₂ ≥ d\n\nTotal response time for two incidents: Rᶜ = R₁ᶜ + R₂ᶜ ≤ d + x₂\nAverage response time: R̄ᶜ = (R₁ᶜ + R₂ᶜ)/2 ≤ (d + x₂)/2\n\n**Step 5: Response Times Under Alternative Strategy**\n\nConsider an alternative strategy: For the first right-side incident, dispatch ambulance A instead of C.\n\n*For first incident at x₁ (right side):*\n- Dispatch A (even though C is closer)\n- Response time for first incident: R₁ᵃ = x₁ ≥ d\n\nA becomes unavailable, but C remains available.\n\n*For second incident at x₂ (right side):*\n- Available ambulances: B and C\n- Distance from C to x₂: |L - x₂| ≤ d\n- Distance from B to x₂: x₂ - ε ≥ d - ε ≈ d\n- Closest available ambulance is C\n- Response time for second incident: R₂ᵃ = |L - x₂| ≤ d\n\nTotal response time for two incidents: Rᵃ = R₁ᵃ + R₂ᵃ ≥ d + |L - x₂|\nAverage response time: R̄ᵃ = (R₁ᵃ + R₂ᵃ)/2 ≥ (d + |L - x₂|)/2\n\n**Step 6: Comparison of Average Response Times**\n\nWe need to compare R̄ᶜ and R̄ᵃ:\n\nR̄ᶜ ≤ (d + x₂)/2\nR̄ᵃ ≥ (d + |L - x₂|)/2\n\nSince x₂ > L/2 and |L - x₂| < d (because x₂ > L/2 implies L - x₂ < L/2 = d), we have:\n\nFor x₂ sufficiently close to L (right end), say x₂ = L - ε:\n- R̄ᶜ ≤ (d + L - ε)/2 = (d + 2d - ε)/2 = (3d - ε)/2\n- R̄ᵃ ≥ (d + ε)/2\n\nClearly, (d + ε)/2 < (3d - ε)/2 for d > ε, which is true since d = L/2 and ε is negligible.\n\nMore generally, for any x₂ where x₂ > 3d/2 (i.e., x₂ > 3L/4):\n- R̄ᶜ > (d + 3d/2)/2 = (5d/2)/2 = 5d/4\n- R̄ᵃ ≤ (d + d/2)/2 = (3d/2)/2 = 3d/4 (since |L - x₂| < d/2 when x₂ > 3L/4)\n\nThus R̄ᵃ < R̄ᶜ when x₂ > 3L/4.\n\n**Step 7: Probability Analysis**\n\nThe probability that both incidents occur on the right side AND the second incident occurs in the region where x₂ > 3L/4 is:\n- Probability incident occurs on right side: p = 1/2\n- Probability second incident occurs in x₂ > 3L/4 given it's on right side: (L/4)/(L/2) = 1/2\n- Joint probability: p² × (1/2) = (1/4) × (1/2) = 1/8 > 0\n\nThus with positive probability (1/8), the alternative strategy yields a strictly better average response time than the closest-dispatch strategy.\n\n**Step 8: Optimality Conclusion**\n\nSince there exists a scenario (with positive probability) where an alternative dispatch strategy yields a lower average response time than the closest-dispatch strategy, the closest-dispatch strategy cannot be optimal for minimizing average response time across all possible incident sequences.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident results in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies.\n\n**Key Insight:** The closest-dispatch strategy is myopic—it optimizes for the current incident without considering future incidents. By sometimes dispatching a farther ambulance to keep strategically positioned ambulances available for potential future incidents, we can achieve better system-wide average response times.\n\nAssumptions:\nAssumption 1: Three ambulances (A, B, C) available\nAssumption 2: Ambulances A and B are located close together on the left side of the region\nAssumption 3: Ambulance C is located on the right side of the region\nAssumption 4: Emergency incidents occur randomly with equal probability anywhere in the region\nAssumption 5: Dispatch strategy prioritizes sending the closest available ambulance to an incident\nAssumption 6: Once dispatched, an ambulance becomes unavailable until the assignment is complete\nAssumption 7: A second emergency can occur after the first dispatch but before repositioning\nAssumption 8: The goal is to minimize average response time across all incidents\n\nProblem:\nProve that dispatching the closest ambulance to an emergency incident results in a non-optimal average response time for the system compared to alternative dispatch strategies.\nWe prove this by constructing a counterexample scenario where an alternative dispatch strategy yields a lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy, thereby demonstrating that closest-dispatch is not always optimal.\n\n**1. Problem Setup and Assumptions:**\nLet the emergency response region be modeled as a line segment of length L, with positions parameterized by x ∈ [0, L]. We have three ambulances:\n- Ambulances A and B are stationed at position 0 (left end)\n- Ambulance C is stationed at position L (right end)\n\nWe assume:\n1. Emergencies occur at random locations with uniform probability distribution over [0, L]\n2. When an emergency occurs, we must dispatch exactly one available ambulance\n3. A dispatched ambulance becomes unavailable until it completes its assignment\n4. A second emergency can occur before the first ambulance returns to its station (repositioning)\n5. Response time for an ambulance at position p to an incident at position x is |p - x|\n6. The system's performance is measured by the total response time for all incidents\n\n**2. Closest-Dispatch Strategy Definition:**\nUnder the closest-dispatch strategy, when an incident occurs at position x, we dispatch the available ambulance that minimizes |p - x|, where p is the ambulance's position.\n\n**3. Counterexample Construction:**\nConsider the following sequence of two incidents:\n- First incident occurs at position x₁, where x₁ > L/2 (on the right side of the region)\n- Second incident occurs at position x₂, where x₂ > x₁ (also on the right side, farther from the left end than x₁)\n\n**4. Analysis of Closest-Dispatch Strategy:**\nFor the first incident at x₁:\n- Distance from left ambulances: |0 - x₁| = x₁\n- Distance from right ambulance: |L - x₁| = L - x₁\nSince x₁ > L/2, we have x₁ > L - x₁, so ambulance C (at L) is closer.\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches ambulance C to the first incident.\n- Ambulance C becomes unavailable.\n\nFor the second incident at x₂:\n- Only ambulances A and B (at 0) are available\n- Distance from available ambulances: |0 - x₂| = x₂\n- Closest-dispatch dispatches either A or B (both at same distance)\n\nTotal response time under closest-dispatch:\nRᶜ = (L - x₁) + x₂ = L + (x₂ - x₁)\n\n**5. Alternative Strategy:**\nConsider an alternative dispatch strategy where for the first incident at x₁, we deliberately dispatch ambulance A or B from the left instead of ambulance C.\n\nFor the first incident at x₁:\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance A or B\n- Response time: x₁\n- Ambulance C remains available\n\nFor the second incident at x₂:\n- Ambulance C is available\n- Distance from ambulance C: |L - x₂| = L - x₂\n- Alternative strategy dispatches ambulance C\n\nTotal response time under alternative strategy:\nRᵃ = x₁ + (L - x₂) = L + (x₁ - x₂)\n\n**6. Comparison of Strategies:**\nCompute the difference in total response times:\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = [L + (x₂ - x₁)] - [L + (x₁ - x₂)]\n          = (x₂ - x₁) - (x₁ - x₂)\n          = 2(x₂ - x₁)\n\nSince we assumed x₂ > x₁, we have x₂ - x₁ > 0, therefore:\nRᶜ - Rᵃ = 2(x₂ - x₁) > 0\n\nThus Rᶜ > Rᵃ, meaning the alternative strategy yields a strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy for this scenario.\n\n**7. Non-Zero Probability of Scenario:**\nSince incidents occur randomly with uniform probability over [0, L], the probability that:\n1. The first incident occurs in (L/2, L) (right side) is 1/2\n2. The second incident occurs in (x₁, L) given the first occurred at x₁ is (L - x₁)/L > 0 for any x₁ < L\n\nTherefore, the probability that both incidents occur on the right side with x₂ > x₁ is strictly positive.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\nWe have constructed a scenario (with non-zero probability) where an alternative dispatch strategy yields strictly lower total response time than the closest-dispatch strategy. This demonstrates that:\n1. The closest-dispatch strategy is not optimal for minimizing total/average response time\n2. There exists at least one alternative strategy that performs better in some scenarios\n\nSince optimality requires a strategy to yield the minimum possible response time for all possible incident sequences (or in expectation), and we have shown a scenario where closest-dispatch is suboptimal, we conclude that dispatching the closest ambulance does not result in optimal average response time for the system.\n\n**9. Generalization:**\nThe counterexample can be extended to show that closest-dispatch is suboptimal in expectation (average case) as well, since with positive probability we encounter scenarios where alternative strategies perform better, and with the remaining probability they perform no worse (by definition of closest-dispatch being locally optimal for single incidents). Therefore, the expected response time under closest-dispatch is strictly greater than what could be achieved by an optimal strategy that considers future incidents.",
