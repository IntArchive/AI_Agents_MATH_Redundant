The properties of exponents used ($2^{n+1} = 2^n \\cdot 2^1$, $2^{n+3} = 2^n \\cdot 2^3$, and $2^n \\cdot 2^7 = 2^{n+7}$) are universally valid for integer exponents\n3. The arithmetic calculations (100 + 20 + 8 = 128 and 128 = 2^7) are constant and independent of $n$\n\nTherefore, we have proven that $100 \\cdot 2^n + 10 \\cdot 2^{n+1} + 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+7}$ for any integer $n$.\n\n**Verification (optional but insightful):**\nWe can verify the result for a few values of $n$:\n- For $n = 0$: $100 \\cdot 1 + 10 \\cdot 2 + 8 = 100 + 20 + 8 = 128 = 2^7$\n- For $n = 1$: $100 \\cdot 2 + 10 \\cdot 4 + 16 = 200 + 40 + 16 = 256 = 2^8 = 2^{1+7}$\n- For $n = 2$: $100 \\cdot 4 + 10 \\cdot 8 + 32 = 400 + 80 + 32 = 512 = 2^9 = 2^{2+7}$\n\nThese verifications confirm the algebraic proof for specific values, though the algebraic proof establishes the result for all integer $n$.",

Factoring this out, we get:\n$$LHS = 2^n (100 + 10 \\cdot 2^1 + 2^3)$$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses**\nWe calculate the value of the expression inside the parentheses:\n$$100 + 10 \\cdot 2^1 + 2^3 = 100 + 10 \\cdot 2 + 8$$\n$$= 100 + 20 + 8$$\n$$= 128$$\n\n**Step 4: Express 128 as a power of 2**\nWe recognize that 128 is a power of 2:\n$$128 = 2^7$$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back and simplify**\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the LHS:\n$$LHS = 2^n \\cdot 128 = 2^n \\cdot 2^7$$\nUsing the exponent rule $a^m \\cdot a^k = a^{m+k}$, we combine the terms:\n$$LHS = 2^{n+7}$$\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have successfully shown that the left-hand side of the equation simplifies to the right-hand side:\n$$100 \\cdot 2^n + 10 \\cdot 2^{n+1} + 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+7}$$\nSince all algebraic manipulations and properties of exponents used are valid for any integer $n$, the equality holds for all integers $n$.\n\nfinal:"
