The left-hand side of the equation is:\n$$LHS = 100 \\cdot 2^n + 10 \\cdot 2^{n+1} + 2^{n+3}$$\n\nFirst, we express each term as a product of a coefficient and $2^n$. We use the exponent rule $a^{m+k} = a^m \\cdot a^k$.\n\n-   The first term is $100 \\cdot 2^n$.\n-   The second term is $10 \\cdot 2^{n+1} = 10 \\cdot (2^1 \\cdot 2^n) = (10 \\cdot 2) \\cdot 2^n = 20 \\cdot 2^n$.\n-   The third term is $2^{n+3} = 2^3 \\cdot 2^n = 8 \\cdot 2^n$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for the LHS, we get:\n$$LHS = 100 \\cdot 2^n + 20 \\cdot 2^n + 8 \\cdot 2^n$$\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term $2^n$:\n$$LHS = (100 + 20 + 8) \\cdot 2^n$$\n\nSumming the coefficients inside the parentheses:\n$$100 + 20 + 8 = 128$$\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$LHS = 128 \\cdot 2^n$$\n\nNext, we express the coefficient 128 as a power of 2. We know that $128 = 2^7$.\n$$LHS = 2^7 \\cdot 2^n$$\n\nUsing the exponent rule $a^m \\cdot a^k = a^{m+k}$, we combine the powers of 2:\n$$LHS = 2^{7+n} = 2^{n+7}$$\n\nWe have successfully shown that the left-hand side of the equation simplifies to the right-hand side:\n$$100 \\cdot 2^n + 10 \\cdot 2^{n+1} + 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+7}$$\n\nSince all the algebraic manipulations and exponent rules used are valid for any integer $n$, the equality holds for all integers $n$.\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nfinal:"
