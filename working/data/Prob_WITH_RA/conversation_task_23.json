By the multiplicative property of determinants, det(AB) = det(A)det(B). The determinant of the identity matrix is 1. So, the equation becomes:\n    det(A)det(B) = 1\n\n4.  This implies that det(A) cannot be zero. For a square matrix, having a non-zero determinant is equivalent to being invertible. Therefore, A is invertible.\n\n5.  Since A is invertible, there exists a unique inverse matrix A⁻¹ such that AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I.\n\n6.  Now, we take the original equation AB = I and multiply it on the left by A⁻¹:\n    A⁻¹(AB) = A⁻¹I\n\n7.  Using the associative property of matrix multiplication, we get:\n    (A⁻¹A)B = A⁻¹\n\n8.  Since A⁻¹A = I, this simplifies to:\n    IB = A⁻¹\n    B = A⁻¹\n\n9.
