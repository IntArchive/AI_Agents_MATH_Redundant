The characteristic polynomial of A is defined as:\n\np(t) = det(A - tI) ∈ F[t]\n\nwhere I is the n × n identity matrix and t is an indeterminate.\n\n**Step 1: Factoring the characteristic polynomial over an algebraic closure**\n\nLet F-bar be an algebraic closure of F. Over F-bar, the polynomial p(t) factors completely into linear factors:\n\np(t) = (-1)^n (t - λ₁)(t - λ₂)⋯(t - λₙ)\n\nwhere λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ ∈ F-bar are the eigenvalues of A (counted with algebraic multiplicity). The factor (-1)^n appears because det(A - tI) = (-1)^n det(tI - A).\n\n**Step 2: Expanding the factored form**\n\nExpand the product (t - λ₁)(t - λ₂)⋯(t - λₙ) using Vieta's formulas or direct expansion:\n\n(t - λ₁)(t - λ₂)⋯(t - λₙ) = t^n - (λ₁ + λ₂ + ⋯ + λₙ)t^{n-1} + ⋯ + (-1)^n λ₁λ₂⋯λₙ\n\nTherefore:\n\np(t) = (-1)^n [t^n - (λ₁ + λ₂ + ⋯ + λₙ)t^{n-1} + ⋯ + (-1)^n λ₁λ₂⋯λₙ]\n\n**Step 3: The standard form of the characteristic polynomial**\n\nFrom the properties of determinants and matrix algebra, we know that the characteristic polynomial can be written as:\n\np(t) = (-1)^n [t^n - (tr A)t^{n-1} + ⋯ + (-1)^n det A]\n\nwhere tr A is the trace of A (sum of diagonal entries) and det A is the determinant of A.\n\n**Step 4: Comparing coefficients**\n\nSince both expressions represent the same polynomial p(t), their coefficients must be equal. In particular, comparing the coefficients of t^{n-1}:\n\nFrom the factored form: coefficient of t^{n-1} = (-1)^n(-(λ₁ + λ₂ + ⋯ + λₙ))\nFrom the standard form: coefficient of t^{n-1} = (-1)^n(-tr A)\n\nThus:\n\n(-1)^n(-(λ₁ + λ₂ + ⋯ + λₙ)) = (-1)^n(-tr A)\n\n**Step 5: Simplifying the equality**\n\nMultiplying both sides by (-1)^{n+1} (or simply canceling the common factors (-1)^n and the negative signs), we obtain:\n\nλ₁ + λ₂ + ⋯ + λₙ = tr A\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the eigenvalues of A (in an algebraic closure of F, counted with algebraic multiplicity) equals the trace of A.\n\nfinal:The proof is correct."
