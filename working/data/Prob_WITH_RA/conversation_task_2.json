The characteristic polynomial is $p(t) = \\det(A - tI)$. We need to show the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$ is $-\\text{tr}(A)$.\n\nApproach 1 (using principal minors):\nThe characteristic polynomial can be written as:\n$$p(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k e_k(A) t^{n-k}$$\nwhere $e_k(A)$ is the sum of all principal minors of $A$ of size $k$. In particular:\n- $e_0(A) = 1$\n- $e_1(A) = \\text{tr}(A)$ (sum of $1 \\times 1$ principal minors, i.e., diagonal entries)\n- $e_n(A) = \\det(A)$\n\nThus, the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$ is $(-1)^1 e_1(A) = -\\text{tr}(A)$.\n\nApproach 2 (direct expansion):\nConsider the Leibniz formula for determinants:\n$$\\det(A - tI) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n (A - tI)_{i,\\sigma(i)}$$\nThe term with $t^{n-1}$ arises when exactly one factor in the product comes from the $-t$ entries on the diagonal. For each $k = 1,\\ldots,n$, if we take $-t$ from position $(k,k)$ and take $a_{ii}$ from all other diagonal positions $i \\neq k$ (with $\\sigma$ being the identity permutation), we get a contribution of $-t \\prod_{i \\neq k} a_{ii}$. However, we must also consider permutations that are transpositions. The complete calculation shows that summing all such contributions gives $-t \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{kk} = -t \\cdot \\text{tr}(A)$, plus terms that don't involve $t^{n-1}$. More systematically, one can observe that $p(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, and by comparing $p(t)$ with $\\det(-tI) = (-t)^n$, we can use multilinearity of the determinant to extract the linear term in the entries of $A$, which yields $-\\text{tr}(A)$ as the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$.\n\nThus, in either approach, we conclude that the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$ in $\\det(A - tI)$ is $-\\text{tr}(A)$.\n"

This happens only when we select all the diagonal entries, which corresponds to the identity permutation \\(\\sigma = \\text{id}\\). For this permutation, \\(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\text{id}) = 1\\). The product is:\n    \\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n (t - a_{ii}) = (t - a_{11})(t - a_{22})\\cdots(t - a_{nn}) \\]\n    Expanding this product gives \\(t^n - (a_{11} + a_{22} + \\cdots + a_{nn})t^{n-1} + \\cdots\\).\n\n2.  **Terms of degree \\(n-1\\):** Let's consider any other permutation \\(\\sigma \\neq \\text{id}\\). Such a permutation must have at least two indices \\(i\\) for which \\(\\sigma(i) \\neq i\\). This means that in the product \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n b_{i, \\sigma(i)}\\), at least two factors will be off-diagonal elements (\\(-a_{ij}\\) where \\(i \\neq j\\)), which do not contain \\(t\\).
