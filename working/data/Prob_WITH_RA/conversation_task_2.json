        "final reviewer": "```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": true,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:** Let A be an n×n square matrix over a field F. The characteristic polynomial of A is given by p(t) = det(A - tI) = (-1)^n(t^n - (tr A)t^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n det A). Let λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ be the eigenvalues of A (roots of p(t) = 0, possibly in an algebraic closure of F). Prove that tr A = λ₁ + λ₂ + ... + λₙ.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe will prove that the trace of matrix A equals the sum of its eigenvalues by comparing two different expressions for the characteristic polynomial p(t).\n\n**Step 1: Characteristic polynomial in given form**\nThe characteristic polynomial of A is given as:\n\\\\[ p(t) = \\\\det(A - tI) = (-1)^n(t^n - (\\\\operatorname{tr} A)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n \\\\det A) \\\\]\nThis is our first expression for p(t).\n\n**Step 2: Characteristic polynomial in factored form**\nSince λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ are the eigenvalues of A, they are the roots of the characteristic equation p(t) = 0. Therefore, we can factor p(t) in terms of its roots. The leading coefficient of p(t) as a polynomial in t is (-1)^n, which comes from the term (-t)^n in the expansion of the determinant. Thus, the factored form is:\n\\\\[ p(t) = (-1)^n(t - λ₁)(t - λ₂)\\\\cdots(t - λₙ) \\\\]\n\n**Step 3: Expand the factored form**\nLet's expand the product part of the factored form. By Vieta's formulas, the expansion of the product is:\n\\\\[ (t - λ₁)(t - λ₂)\\\\cdots(t - λₙ) = t^n - (λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n λ₁λ₂\\\\cdots λₙ \\\\]\n\n**Step 4: Complete the second expression for p(t)**\nMultiplying the expanded product by the leading coefficient (-1)^n gives our second expression for p(t):\n\\\\[ p(t) = (-1)^n[t^n - (λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n λ₁λ₂\\\\cdots λₙ] \\\\]\n\n**Step 5: Compare coefficients**\nWe now have two expressions for the same polynomial p(t):\n1.  From the given form: \\\\[ p(t) = (-1)^n t^n - (-1)^n (\\\\operatorname{tr} A)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots \\\\]\n2.  From the factored form: \\\\[ p(t) = (-1)^n t^n - (-1)^n (λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots \\\\]\n\nSince these expressions represent the same polynomial, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. We compare the coefficients of the t^{n-1} term.\n\nFrom expression 1, the coefficient of t^{n-1} is:\n\\\\[ -(-1)^n \\\\operatorname{tr} A \\\\]\n\nFrom expression 2, the coefficient of t^{n-1} is:\n\\\\[ -(-1)^n (λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ) \\\\]\n\n**Step 6: Equate coefficients and conclude**\nSetting the coefficients equal to each other:\n\\\\[ -(-1)^n \\\\operatorname{tr} A = -(-1)^n (λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ) \\\\]\nSince n ≥ 1, the term -(-1)^n is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by it:\n\\\\[ \\\\operatorname{tr} A = λ₁ + λ₂ + \\\\cdots + λₙ \\\\]\nThis completes the proof. We have shown that the trace of matrix A is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues.\n\nfinal:"
