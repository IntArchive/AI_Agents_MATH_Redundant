The decimal parts are identical (both consist of infinitely many 9s after the decimal point), so they cancel completely:\n   0.999999999... - 0.999999999... = 0.\nTherefore:\n   9x = 9.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nDividing both sides by 9:\n   x = 9/9 = 1.\n\nSince x was defined as 0.999999999..., we conclude that 0.999999999... = 1.\n\n**Approach 2: Geometric Series**\n\nStep 1: Express 0.999999999... as an infinite sum\nThe decimal expansion can be written as:\n   0.999999999... = 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + ...\n                  = 9×0.1 + 9×0.01 + 9×0.001 + 9×0.0001 + ...\n                  = 9 × (0.1 + 0.01 + 0.001 + 0.0001 + ...).\n\nStep 2: Recognize this as a geometric series\nThe series inside the parentheses is:\n   S = 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.001 + 0.0001 + ...\n     = 0.1 + 0.1² + 0.1³ + 0.1⁴ + ...\nThis is a geometric series with first term a = 0.1 and common ratio r = 0.1.\n\nStep 3: Apply the geometric series formula\nFor a geometric series with |r| < 1, the sum is given by:\n   S = a/(1-r).\nSince a = 0.1 and r = 0.1, and |0.1| < 1, we have:\n   S = 0.1/(1 - 0.1) = 0.1/0.9 = 1/9.\n\nStep 4: Compute the final result\nSubstituting back:\n   0.999999999... = 9 × S = 9 × (1/9) = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth approaches confirm that 0.999999999... = 1 within the real number system (Assumption 2). This equality is not an approximation but an exact identity: the infinite decimal 0.999999999... and the integer 1 represent the same real number. This result reflects the completeness property of the real numbers, where every convergent sequence has a limit in the real numbers, and the limit of the partial sums defining 0.999999999... is precisely 1. ∎",
