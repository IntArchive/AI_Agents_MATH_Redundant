    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement is then simplified.\n\nThe original question is about whether the inverse of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric. Let me parse through the question carefully. The user mentions a matrix A that's symmetric (A^T = A), invertible, and that its inverse commutes with A (since A inverse times A is identity, same as A times A inverse). The problem is to show that A inverse is symmetric.\n\nSo, first, identify all the assumptions. The matrix A has two properties: it's symmetric (so transpose equals itself), and it's invertible (so inverse exists). The inverse's properties include commuting with A to give identity. But the key assumptions here are that A is symmetric and invertible. The problem is to prove that A inverse is symmetric.\n\nWait, the example given in the format includes assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a separate line. So in this case, the matrix A has properties: symmetric, invertible. Each of these is a separate assumption. However, the invertible part is mentioned in the question, but the problem statement might need to have those as assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"Let A be a symmetric invertible matrix, A^T = A, A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = I\". So the user lists that A is symmetric, invertible, and that the inverse commutes. But actually, the invertibility implies that the inverse exists and commutes, so maybe the key assumptions are that A is symmetric and invertible. The commutation is a result of the inverse existing. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a symmetric matrix (A^T = A)\n- A is invertible (so there exists A^{-1} such that A A^{-1} = I and A^{-1} A = I)\n\nThen the problem is to show that A^{-1} is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be each on their own line. Each applies to A. The problem is to show the inverse is symmetric.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is invertible.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A^{-1} is also symmetric.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the user included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, \"A is symmetric\" and \"A is invertible\" are separate properties. So that's two assumptions. The problem is to show the inverse is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is invertible.\nProblem:\nProve that A^{-1} is symmetric.\n\nBut the user also included in the original problem statement that A^{-1}A = AA^{-1} = I, but that's part of the definition of invertible matrices. So perhaps the key assumptions are the two: symmetry and invertibility. The rest follows from the definition of inverse. So in the formatted problem, those would be the two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should follow this structure.",

Since $A$ is symmetric: $A = A^T$ (Assumption 1)\n2. Since $A$ is invertible: $A^{-1}$ exists (Assumption 2)\n3. We know: $A^{-1}A = I$ (definition of inverse)\n4. Taking transpose of both sides: $(A^{-1}A)^T = I^T$\n5. Since $I^T = I$: $(A^{-1}A)^T = I$\n6. Using transpose property $(XY)^T = Y^TX^T$: $A^T(A^{-1})^T = I$\n7. Since $A = A^T$: $A(A^{-1})^T = I$\n8. Multiply both sides on the left by $A^{-1}$: $A^{-1}A(A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}I$\n9. This simplifies to: $I(A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}$\n10. Therefore: $(A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}$\nThus, $A^{-1}$ is symmetric.\n",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\n\n**Problem:** Given that A is a symmetric and invertible matrix, prove that its inverse, A⁻¹, is also symmetric.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet A be a symmetric and invertible n×n matrix.\n\n1.  By the definition of a symmetric matrix, we have:\n    A = Aᵀ\n\n2.  By the definition of an invertible matrix, the inverse A⁻¹ exists and satisfies:\n    AA⁻¹ = I, where I is the identity matrix.\n\n3.  We can take the transpose of both sides of the equation AA⁻¹ = I:\n    (AA⁻¹)ᵀ = Iᵀ\n\n4.  The transpose of the identity matrix is the identity matrix itself (Iᵀ = I). Using the property for the transpose of a product, (XY)ᵀ = YᵀXᵀ, we get:\n    (A⁻¹)ᵀAᵀ = I\n\n5.  Since A is symmetric, we can substitute A for Aᵀ in the equation:\n    (A⁻¹)ᵀA = I\n\n6.  Now, right-multiply both sides by A⁻¹:\n    ((A⁻¹)ᵀA)A⁻¹ = IA⁻¹\n\n7.  Using the associative property of matrix multiplication on the left side and the property of the identity matrix on the right side:\n    (A⁻¹)ᵀ(AA⁻¹) = A⁻¹\n\n8.  Since AA⁻¹ = I, this simplifies to:\n    (A⁻¹)ᵀI = A⁻¹\n\n9.  Finally, any matrix multiplied by the identity matrix is the matrix itself, so:\n    (A⁻¹)ᵀ = A⁻¹\n\nThis shows that A⁻¹ is equal to its transpose, which is the definition of a symmetric matrix. Thus, the inverse of a symmetric invertible matrix is also symmetric.\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nfinal:Given that A is a symmetric and invertible matrix, prove that A⁻¹ is also symmetric.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet A be a symmetric and invertible matrix.\nBy definition of a symmetric matrix, A = Aᵀ.\nThe inverse of A, denoted A⁻¹, exists and satisfies AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nWe can use the matrix identity (B⁻¹)ᵀ = (Bᵀ)⁻¹, which holds for any invertible matrix B.\nLet's apply this to our matrix A:\n1.  Start with the definition of a symmetric matrix for A⁻¹: we want to prove (A⁻¹)ᵀ = A⁻¹.\n2.  Using the identity, we have (A⁻¹)ᵀ = (Aᵀ)⁻¹.\n3.  Since A is given to be symmetric, A = Aᵀ. We can substitute A for Aᵀ in the equation: (Aᵀ)⁻¹ = A⁻¹.\n4.  Combining these steps, we get (A⁻¹)ᵀ = A⁻¹.\n\nThis proves that A⁻¹ is a symmetric matrix.",
