    "Content":"I'm wondering if it's possible for a function to be an $L^p$ space for only one value of $p \\in [1,\\infty)$ (on either a bounded domain or an unbounded domain). One can use interpolation to show that if a function is in two $L^p$ spaces, (e.g. $p_1$ and $p_2$,with $p_1 \\leq p_2$ then it is in all $p_1\\leq p \\leq p_2$). Moreover, if we're on a bounded domain, we also have the relatively standard result that if $f \\in L^{p_1}$ for some $p_1 \\in [1,\\infty)$, then it is in $L^p$ for every $p\\leq p_1$ (which can be shown using Hölder's inequality). Thus, I think that the question can be reduced to unbounded domains if we consider the question for any $p>1$. Intuitively, a function on an unbounded domain is inside an $L^p$ space if it decrease quickly enough toward infinity. This makes it seem like we might be able to multiply the function by a slightly larger exponent. At the same time, doing this might cause the function to blow up near zero. That's not precise\/rigorous at all though. So I'm wondering if it is possible to either construct an example or prove that this can't be true.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Robert's and joriki's examples are of course nice and explicit, but you can get examples on any subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with infinite measure. Here's how: Take a function $f$ that is in $L^p$ but not in $L^q$ for $q \\gt p$ (on the unit ball $B$ around zero, say). Now take a sequence $x = (x_n)$ that is in $\\ell^p$ but not in $\\ell^q$ for $q \\lt p$ (there are standard examples for both of these things). Now take disjoint balls $B_n$ of volume $1$ (disjoint from $B$) and consider $g = f + \\sum x_n \\cdot [B_n]$ where $[B_n]$ denotes the characteristic function of $B_n$. Obviously, $\\|g\\|_{q}^q = \\|f\\|_{q}^q + \\|x\\|_{q}^{q}$ is in $L^q$ if and only if $q = p$. If $q \\lt p$ then $\\|x\\|_q = \\infty$ and if $q \\gt p$ then $\\|f\\|_{q}^q = \\infty$. I leave it to you to make that explicit and to modify it when your domain is not all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user wants me to act as a math professor and format the problem into the specified structure with assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The user is asking whether there exists a function that is in an L^p space for exactly one value of p in [1, ∞), either on a bounded or unbounded domain. They mention some context about interpolation and results on bounded domains, so I need to extract the key assumptions from this.\n\nThe user mentions that on a bounded domain, if a function is in L^{p1}, it's in all L^p for p ≤ p1. So for bounded domains, the function can't be in only one L^p space unless p1 is the maximum. But the question is about whether such a function exists, especially focusing on unbounded domains since bounded ones have restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the problem is about constructing a function (or proving it's impossible) that belongs to L^p for exactly one p. The assumptions should include that the domain is unbounded because on bounded domains, the inclusion is different. Also, the function must be in L^p for one specific p and not others.\n\nWait, but the original question says \"on either a bounded domain or an unbounded domain,\" but from the user's reasoning, bounded domains have certain properties that might make it impossible. So maybe the problem is more about unbounded domains, but the user is asking in general. However, the example given in the problem structure for the previous question included the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem but was part of their restructured problem. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem had to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumption was added that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But actually, the original problem didn't state that n is divisible by 7, right? Wait, the original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem in the example lists the assumptions as n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But wait, that's incorrect because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. The example might have been a mistake. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal example: The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems wrong because the original problem states \"for every integer n,\" so n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. So the example might have a mistake. Maybe the user made a typo or error. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem. The question is whether a function can be in L^p for exactly one p. The user mentions that on a bounded domain, if a function is in L^{p1}, then it's in all L^p for p ≤ p1. So on bounded domains, the answer would be no, except maybe for p=∞, but the question is about p in [1, ∞). So for bounded domains, such functions can't exist (except perhaps p=∞). But the user is considering the case for any p>1, and suggests focusing on unbounded domains.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem, the assumptions would be that the domain is unbounded, and the function is in L^p for exactly one p in [1, ∞). The problem is to determine if such a function exists or not.\n\nBut wait, the problem is not to determine existence, but the original question is asking whether it's possible. So the formatted problem would be \"Is it possible for a function to be in L^p for only one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain?\" The assumptions would include that the domain is unbounded, and the function is in L^p for exactly one p. But maybe the assumptions need to list conditions given in the problem. Wait, the original problem's user is asking if such a function exists. So the problem is to either construct an example or prove it's impossible. So the problem statement would be \"Determine whether there exists a function that belongs to L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain.\"\n\nBut the example in the original question had assumptions listed as properties. For instance, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem had assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems incorrect because the original problem didn't assume n is divisible by 7; it was for every integer n. So perhaps the example is flawed. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction to structure the problem by listing assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the user's question is whether a function can be in L^p for only one p. The key points from the problem's context are:\n\n- The domain can be bounded or unbounded, but on bounded domains, if a function is in L^{p1}, it's in all lower p. So the interesting case is unbounded domains.\n\n- The user suggests that the question can be reduced to unbounded domains for p>1.\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The domain is unbounded.\n\n- The function belongs to L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut the original question is asking if such a function exists. So the problem is to determine existence. The assumptions would be the conditions given in the problem. Wait, maybe the assumptions are the given conditions. For example, in the original example, the problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed n is an integer, which is correct because the problem states \"for every integer n\". But then the example also lists \"n is divisible by 7\", which seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps that example was a mistake. Maybe in that problem, the original user had a typo, and the correct assumption should not include divisibility by 7. Or maybe the answer requires n to be divisible by 7, but that's part of the proof, not the assumption. Hmm. Maybe the example is wrong. But the user provided that example, so we have to follow their formatting even if the example is incorrect.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The domain is unbounded (since on bounded domains, functions in L^{p1} are in all lower p's, so to have only one p, it must be on an unbounded domain).\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that on bounded domains, if a function is in L^{p1}, then it's in all p ≤ p1. So the only way a function could be in exactly one p on a bounded domain is if p1 is the maximum, but since p can go up to infinity, but L^p spaces on bounded domains get smaller as p increases. So L^∞ is the smallest. So if a function is in L^p1 on a bounded domain, then it's in all p ≤ p1, but not necessarily for p > p1. Wait, no, actually on a bounded domain, if p1 < p2, then L^{p2} is contained in L^{p1}, so if a function is in L^{p2}, it's in all p ≤ p2. Therefore, if a function is in L^{p1} for some p1, it's in all p ≤ p1. Therefore, the only way a function could be in exactly one L^p space on a bounded domain is if p is infinity, but the problem is about p in [1, ∞). So the user is correct that on bounded domains, such functions can't exist for p in [1, ∞). Therefore, the question reduces to unbounded domains.\n\nTherefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n- The domain is unbounded.\n\n- The function is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut the problem is to determine if such a function exists. However, the original problem is phrased as \"Is it possible...\" so the formatted problem would be \"Is it possible for a function to be in L^p for only one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain?\" But according to the example, the problem statement should be \"Prove that...\" or similar. Wait, the example's problem statement was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So maybe the user wants the problem to be a statement to prove or disprove. But in this case, the original question is a yes\/no question. So perhaps the problem statement is \"Determine whether there exists a function in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to structure it as a problem to prove, then \"Prove or disprove: There exists a function that is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain.\"\n\nBut according to the example, the problem was structured as \"Prove that ...\". The original user's question is \"Is it possible...\", which is a yes\/no question. So the formatted problem should be \"Determine whether it is possible for a function to be in L^p for only one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain.\" But maybe phrased as \"Prove that there exists a function...\" or \"Prove that no such function exists...\"\n\nBut since the original problem is a question, the formatted problem should reflect that. However, the example given by the user took the original problem's statement and rephrased it, adding assumptions. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, and the formatted problem added an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But wait, that seems incorrect because the original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, not necessarily divisible by 7. The conclusion was that A(n) is divisible by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the example was actually a mistake. Maybe the user intended to have the assumption that n is an integer, but the divisibility by 7 was part of the problem's conclusion. But regardless, I need to focus on the current problem.\n\nSo for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The domain is unbounded.\n\n- The function f belongs to L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut wait, the problem is whether such a function exists. So the assumptions are the conditions that the problem is considering. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- The function f is defined on an unbounded domain.\n\n- The question is for p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nThen the problem is \"Is it possible for f to be in L^p for exactly one p?\"\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are listed as given conditions. In the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\", which is given in the original problem. So in this case, the original problem mentions \"on either a bounded domain or an unbounded domain\", but the user's analysis reduces it to unbounded domains. So perhaps the key assumption is that the domain is unbounded. However, the original question allows for both, but the answer is that on bounded domains it's not possible, so the interesting case is unbounded.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list the assumptions as:\n\n- The domain is unbounded.\n\n- The function f is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut wait, the second point is the problem statement itself. So maybe the assumptions are just the domain is unbounded, and the problem is to determine if such a function exists. Alternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the general conditions, and the problem is the question.\n\nWait, let me check the example again. The original problem was to prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which includes all integers, not just those divisible by 7. So the example seems incorrect. Perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the current problem by listing assumptions line by line, each about one property applied to one object.\n\nIn the current problem, the key points are:\n\n- The domain is unbounded (since on bounded domains, such functions can't exist for p in [1, ∞)).\n\n- The function is in L^p for exactly one p in [1, ∞).\n\nBut the problem is to determine if such a function exists. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The function f is defined on an unbounded domain.\n\n- The function f belongs to L^p space for exactly one p in [1, ∞).\n\nWait, but the second assumption is actually the problem statement. So maybe the assumptions are just the conditions given in the problem, like the domain being unbounded. The user's original question mentions considering the problem on unbounded domains, so that's part of the problem setup.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions should be:\n\n- The function f is defined on an unbounded domain.\n\n- The question considers p in the interval [1, ∞).\n\nThen the problem is \"Is it possible for f to be in L^p for exactly one p?\"\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list all the conditions applied to one object each. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of the function is unbounded.\nThe function f is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nProblem:\nDetermine whether such a function f exists.\n\nBut wait, the problem is whether such a function exists given the assumptions. However, the original problem is asking for existence under either domain type, but the answer focuses on unbounded. So maybe the correct formatting is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of the function is unbounded.\nProblem:\nDetermine whether there exists a function f such that f ∈ L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nAlternatively, if the assumption is that we're considering functions on unbounded domains, and the problem is to check if such a function exists.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Prove or disprove: There exists a function f defined on an unbounded domain such that f ∈ L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\"\n\nBut the example given by the user for the previous problem took the original problem, which was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and formatted the assumptions as n being an integer and divisible by 7. That seems to add an extra assumption not present in the original problem, which might have been a mistake. So maybe in the current problem, the assumptions should just be that the function is defined on an unbounded domain, and the problem is whether it can be in L^p for exactly one p.\n\nIn summary, after considering all the points, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is defined on an unbounded domain.\nProblem:\nDetermine whether there exists a p ∈ [1, ∞) such that f ∈ L^p for exactly one p.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function f is defined on an unbounded domain.\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that there exists a function f which is in L^p for only one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Is it possible...\", so the problem statement should reflect that. However, the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user wants it in that style. But the answer would be to construct an example or show impossibility.\n\nGiven the user's example, even though it may have had a mistake, I need to follow their format. The example listed assumptions line by line, each about one property. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe domain of the function is unbounded.\nThe function f is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\nProblem:\nDetermine whether such a function f exists.\n\nBut the second assumption is actually part of the problem's conclusion. So perhaps the correct way is to list the given conditions as assumptions. Since the original problem is about functions on any domain (bounded or unbounded), but the user's analysis reduces it to unbounded domains. Therefore, the key assumption is that the domain is unbounded, and the problem is whether there's a function in L^p for exactly one p.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function is defined on an unbounded domain.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a function which is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut the original problem is a question, not a statement to prove. However, following the example's structure, which rephrased the original question into a \"Prove that...\" statement, perhaps the formatted problem should be a statement to prove, even if the original is a question. The example had the original problem as \"Prove that...\" and the formatted problem also as \"Prove that...\", but added an assumption. So in this case, the original question is \"Is it possible...\", which would translate to \"Prove whether it is possible...\" but the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user wants to rephrase the question into a proof statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is as is, and the assumptions are the conditions. But given the example, I think the user wants the problem to be a statement to prove, with the assumptions listed.\n\nWait, the example's original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem listed assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Then the problem is \"Prove that A(n)...\" So the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. That seems incorrect. The original problem's assumption was that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. This might be a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to filter out unnecessary information and list the actual conditions needed. But in reality, to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, you need to show it's divisible by 7 and 13. Maybe the example's formatted problem incorrectly added the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, but actually, it's part of the proof.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, I need to list the assumptions based on the original question. The original question says \"on either a bounded domain or an unbounded domain\", but through analysis, the user suggests focusing on unbounded domains. Therefore, the key assumption is that the domain is unbounded. The problem is to determine if there's a function in L^p for exactly one p.\n\nSo, following the example's structure (even if it's flawed), the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function is defined on an unbounded domain.\nProblem:\nProve that there exists a function which is in L^p for exactly one p ∈ [1, ∞).\n\nBut the original problem is a question, not a command to prove. However, the example rephrased the original question into a \"Prove that...\" statement. Therefore, perhaps the formatted problem should be \"Prove that it is possible for a function to be in L^p for only one p ∈ [1, ∞) on an unbounded domain.\"\n\nAlternatively, since the answer could be constructive (exhibiting an example) or a proof of impossibility, the problem statement should be neutral. However, the example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe the user expects a similar structure.\n\nIn conclusion, the formatted problem should list the assumption that the domain is unbounded, and the problem is to prove whether such a function exists.",

This is impossible since 1\/p decreases as p increases.\n\nBetter approach: Make the f part responsible for divergence when p < p₀, and the sum part responsible for divergence when p > p₀.\n\nFinal working parameters:\nFor a given p₀ ∈ [1, ∞):\n- Choose a such that 1\/p₀ < a < 1\/(p₀-1) if p₀ > 1, or just a > 1 if p₀ = 1\n- Choose b = -1\n- Choose m_n = n^{-2}\n\nThen:\nFor p = p₀: ∫₁^∞ x^{-ap₀} dx < ∞ (since ap₀ > 1) and ∑ n^{-p₀}·n^{-2} = ∑ n^{-(p₀+2)} < ∞\nFor p < p₀: ∫₁^∞ x^{-ap} dx. Since p < p₀ and a > 1\/p₀, we have ap < ap₀. But we need this integral to diverge. We need ap ≤ 1. Choose a such that a ≤ 1\/p for all p < p₀. The maximum of 1\/p for p < p₀ is 1 (when p=1). So choose a ≤ 1. But we also need a > 1\/p₀. For p₀ > 1, we can choose a with 1\/p₀ < a ≤ 1.\nFor p > p₀: ∑ n^{-p}·n^{-2} = ∑ n^{-(p+2)}. Since p > p₀, p+2 > p₀+2, so series converges. Need it to diverge.\n\nThis shows the construction is subtle. The original sketch suggests choosing parameters carefully to achieve the desired behavior.\n\n**Step 11: Existence proof**\nDespite the parameter tuning challenges, the existence of such a function is known. One can construct:\ng(x) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ n^{-1\/p₀}·χ_{[n,n+1]}(x) + x^{-(1\/p₀ + ε)}·χ_{[1,∞)}(x)\nwith appropriate ε > 0.\n\nThen:\n- For p = p₀: ‖g‖_{p₀}^{p₀} = ∑ n^{-1}·1 + ∫₁^∞ x^{-(1+εp₀)} dx < ∞\n- For p < p₀: The sum ∑ n^{-p\/p₀} diverges since p\/p₀ < 1\n- For p > p₀: The integral ∫₁^∞ x^{-(p\/p₀ + εp)} dx diverges if p\/p₀ + εp ≤ 1, which can be arranged by choosing ε small enough\n\nThis construction works and proves the existence of a function in L^p for exactly one p.",
