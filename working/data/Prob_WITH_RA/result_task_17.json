    "Content":"Conor McBride asks for a fast proof that $$x = {\\left(\\pi^\\pi\\right)}^{\\pi^\\pi}$$ is not an integer.  It would be sufficient to calculate a very rough approximation, to a precision of less than $1,$ and show that $n < x < n+1$ for some integer $n$ .  But $x$ is large enough ( $56$ digits) that that method is not obviously practical without electronic computation tools. Is there a purely theoretic proof that works with no calculation at all, or is there a calculational argument that would be practical prior to $1950$ ? Edit : Let me phrase the question a little differently, as a spur to your mathematical imagination. I go back in time to $1847$ and have lunch with Carl Friedrich Gauss.  We are chatting about the developments in $20$ th and $21$ st-century mathematics, and because I am a horrible person, I mention that $(\\pi^\\pi)^{\\pi^\\pi}$ has been proven to be an integer. Gauss is incredulous, but I insist. After I leave, can Gauss convince himself that I am nothing but a troll? Edit : After I looked back at McBride's original question , I saw to my dismay that he had not asked about $x= (\\pi^\\pi)^{\\pi^\\pi}$ , but $$y=\\pi^{\\left(\\pi^{\\pi^\\pi}\\right)}$$ which is a rather different animal. The value of $x$ has $57$ decimal digits; the value of $y$ has $10^{57}$ digits .  So Alexander Walker's impressive display of direct numerical calculation will avail nothing for deciding that $y$ is not an integer, neither in $1873$ nor in $2013,$ and perhaps not in $2153$ either. (\"We should attempt to destroy the aliens.\") More powerful theoretical methods will be required.  I am posting an additional bounty to see if anyone can suggest anything of that sort; it need not be theory that was available in the $19$ th century.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"I think this calculation would have been doable in 1873, as follows: (1) Compute $\\log \\pi$ to $60$ digits.  For this, we begin with the expansion $$\\log \\pi = \\log \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{22\/7}\\right)+\\log 2 + \\log 11-\\log 7$$ and take full advantage of the fact that the logarithm tables of small integers were known to great precision.  As for the logarithm of $\\pi\/(22\/7) \\approx 1.00041$, the Taylor series for the logarithm spits out $60$ digits after only $17$ terms. (Surprisingly, this exact analysis has been done on MSE before.) (2) Compute $(\\pi+1)\\log \\pi$ to $60$ digits.  This is no big deal, given our value for $\\log \\pi$ from (1), since $\\pi$ was known ( to Gauss, no less! ) to at least $100$ digits back in 1844.  For reference, this value is $$ \\approx 4.7410048855785583722294291029994190930164741026691888020108672.$$ (The multiplication will of course be a pain, as it requires around $1800$ flops.  Nevertheless, this computation would likely be delegated to a lesser mathematician.  The Wikipedia article on Zacharias Dase (a temporary assistant to Gauss) puts these computations into perspective: At age 15 [Zacharias Dase] began to travel extensively, giving exhibitions in Germany, Austria and England. Among his most impressive feats, he multiplied 79532853 × 93758479 in 54 seconds. He multiplied two 20-digit numbers in 6 minutes; two 40-digit numbers in 40 minutes; and two 100-digit numbers in 8 hours 45 minutes. The famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss commented that someone skilled in calculation could have done the 100-digit calculation in about half that time with pencil and paper. (3) Exponentiate the product, again to $60$ places. Using just the series\n$$e^z = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{z^k}{k!}$$\nsuch a calculation would require $77$ terms.  For this reason, we instead calculate\n$$e^{4.741} \\approx 114.54869311801681310751748724665811195370661075419665168411647;$$\n$$e^{0.0000048\\cdots} \\approx 1.0000048855904928305900123833767696556988185632721564706179420.$$\nThe latter approximation requires a mere $10$ terms of the exponential Taylor series to achieve $60$ digits, a commitment of around 18000 flops.  By Gauss's metric, we might expect a skilled mathematician to complete this task in just over seven hours. The prior calculation could be done in one of two ways: directly, at a cost of another $18000$ flops (e.g. $77$ consecutive multiplications of a $4$-digit and a $60$-digit number); or by calculating $\\mathrm{exp}(4)$ and $\\mathrm{exp}(.741)$ independently (a slight time savings, I believe, even after the final multiplication).  Of course, now it just takes another $1800$ flops to multiply these numbers to $60$ places. Note: In hindsight, it appears that calculating the triple product $$e^4 e^{3\/4}e^{-9\/1000}$$ may expedite this most recent step. In case you've lost track, we now know the value of\n$$e^{(\\pi +1)\\log \\pi}=\\pi^{\\pi+1}$$\nto $60$ digits, all within a day or two of starting our calculations. (4) Multiply $\\log \\pi$ and $\\pi^{\\pi+1}$ to $60$ digits.  This step is easy, given steps (1) and (3).  This value is\n$$\\approx 131.12795303153615589452803943707399841542170349230159549341360.$$\nOf course, this value is also the logarithm of $(\\pi^\\pi)^{\\pi^\\pi}$, so it remains to: (5) Exponentiate the term from (4).  Since it worked out so well in (3), we'll again split our exponential into a product of simpler terms.  Here, we luck out - since the binary expansion of $131.127953\\ldots$ begins as\n$$10000011.001000001100000\\cdots_2,$$\nthe partial approximation $131+1\/8$ is surprisingly accurate: to within $\\approx 0.002953$.  The exponential of this remainder can be made accurate to over $60$ digits with a mere $18$ terms (i.e. $32000$ flops). Secondly, we compute $e^{131}$ to $60$ digits, using iterated multiplication and an approximation of $e$ to $62$ digits ( $205$ digits were known to William Shanks in 1871 ).  Since it suffices here to successively compute\n$$e^2,e^4,e^8,e^{16},e^{32},e^{64},e^{128},$$\nthis step can be done in less than $15000$ flops.  Thirdly, we compute $e^{1\/8}$ to $60$ digits using three applications of Newton's method for the square root (another $6000$ flops).  We find a value of\n$$ \\approx 887455172183124295874631455225434602688412866765466125005\\color{red}{.16},$$\na non-integer. All said and done, I would be surprised if this calculation took much longer than a week.  At the same time, I stress that this problem would have been barely doable in that era.  If twice the number of digits were required, for example, this work may very well have taken the better part of a year.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving that two different expressions involving powers of π are not integers. The first expression is x = (π^π)^(π^π), and the second is y = π^(π^(π^π)). The edits mention that the focus shifted to y after realizing the original problem was about that.\n\nNow, looking at the assumptions. The problem is about whether these expressions are integers. The key points are:\n\n1. The numbers involved are π (which is transcendental) and its various exponentials.\n2. The structure of the expressions: multiple exponents stacked.\n3. The need for a theoretical proof without heavy computation, especially for y which is extremely large.\n\nThe assumptions should list the properties or conditions applied to each object. Since π is transcendental, that's one assumption. Then, the expressions being discussed (x and y) are formed by exponentiation of π. However, the problem mentions two different expressions. Wait, but in the example given, the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, the problem is about proving a number is not an integer. The assumptions would relate to the properties of π and the structure of the exponentiation.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't have explicit conditions applied to the objects except that π is transcendental. The expressions x and y are constructed using π. So, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- π is a transcendental number.\n- Exponentiation is performed in the order specified (right-associative for y).\n\nBut the problem statement mentions both x and y. Wait, the user's example had assumptions about n, but here the problem is about the properties of π and the expressions built from it. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\nπ is a transcendental number.\nx is defined as (π^π)^(π^π).\ny is defined as π^(π^(π^π)).\n\nBut wait, the original problem in the example had assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7, which are conditions on the variable. Here, the variables x and y are defined in terms of π. The problem is to prove they are non-integers. So the assumptions would be the definitions of x and y and the transcendentality of π. But maybe also that exponentiation is done as specified (order matters). \n\nHowever, the problem mentions two different expressions. The user's example had only one problem statement. But here, the original question mentions both x and y. Wait, the user's formatted example combined two parts into one problem? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question starts with proving x is not an integer, then the edit changes it to y. The user wants to structure the problem as per the example. The example had one problem statement. So perhaps the problem here is to prove that y (π^(π^(π^π))) is a non-integer. But the initial problem was about x, then the edit shifted to y. The user included both, but the main problem is about y now. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- π is a transcendental number.\n- y is defined as π^(π^(π^π)).\n\nBut the problem statement needs to capture both the original x and the edited y? Wait, in the example, the assumption included the divisibility by 7, but here, the key properties are the transcendentality of π and the structure of y. The problem as phrased in the original question after the edit is about y. The title mentions both, but the main focus is y. So perhaps:\n\nProblem: Prove that y = π^(π^(π^π)) is a non-integer.\n\nBut the original problem also mentioned x, but the user clarified that the edit changed it to y. So the assumptions should list that π is transcendental, and the definition of y. But also, maybe that exponentiation is right-associative (since y is π^(π^(π^π)) rather than left-associative. So:\n\nAssumption:\nπ is a transcendental number,\ny is defined as π raised to the power of (π raised to the power of (π raised to the power of π)).\n\nProblem: Prove that y is not an integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption about the definition is part of the problem statement. But in the example, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The problem was then to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. So here, the assumptions would be about the properties of π (transcendental) and the definition of y. The problem is to prove y is not an integer. So I think that's the correct structure.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: False\n\nThe provided proof is incorrect. Its central argument relies on unproven conjectures and contains statements that are not known to be true in transcendental number theory.\n\n1.  **Incorrect Claims:** The proof asserts that `π^π` and `π^(π^π)` are known to be transcendental numbers. The transcendence of these numbers is a famous open problem. The Gelfond-Schneider theorem does not apply here because the base (`π`) is transcendental, whereas the theorem requires an algebraic base.\n2.  **Reliance on an Unproven Conjecture:** The argument for contradiction hinges on the algebraic independence of numbers like `π`, `ln π`, and `π^π`. The proof correctly notes that this would follow from Schanuel's conjecture, but this conjecture remains unproven. A valid proof cannot be based on an unproven conjecture.\n3.  **Circular Reasoning:** The algebraic manipulations in Step 4, which derive `A · ln A = B · ln N` and `A · ln B = π · ln N`, are algebraically correct but ultimately circular. Both equations are simply rearrangements of the initial assumption `π^(π^π) · ln π = ln N`. They do not introduce a new relationship that can be used to create a contradiction. The contradiction only arises if one assumes the (unproven) algebraic independence of the terms in the equation.\n\nThe only part of the proof that is correct is the special case for `N=1`.

The argument proceeds by taking logarithms to establish the equation `π^(π^π) · ln π = ln N`.\n\nThe fatal flaw lies in Step 5, which makes several incorrect claims and relies on an unproven conjecture:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Transcendence Claims:** The proof incorrectly states that `π^π` and `π^(π^π)` are known to be transcendental as a consequence of the Gelfond-Schneider theorem. This is false. The Gelfond-Schneider theorem applies to `α^β` where `α` is algebraic and `β` is algebraic and irrational. Since `π` is transcendental, the theorem does not apply. The transcendence of `π^π` is a famous unsolved problem.\n2.  **Reliance on Schanuel's Conjecture:** The core of the argument rests on the algebraic independence of `π`, `ln π`, `π^π`, etc. The proof correctly notes that this would follow from Schanuel's conjecture, but this is a major unproven conjecture in mathematics. A proof cannot be based on an unproven result.\n\nWhile the conclusion of the theorem is widely believed to be true, this proof is not valid because its central claims are not supported by established mathematical theorems.
