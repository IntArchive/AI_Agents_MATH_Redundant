We define the function f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k |x - s_i|, which represents the sum of the absolute distances from a point x to all points in S. We aim to find the value of x that minimizes f(x).\n\nThe function f(x) is continuous and convex. Its derivative with respect to x, where it exists (for x ∉ S), is given by:\nf'(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k sgn(x - s_i)\nwhere sgn is the sign function. The value of f'(x) is the number of points in S that are less than x minus the number of points in S that are greater than x. The minimum of f(x) occurs where its derivative changes sign from negative to positive.\n\nWe consider two cases based on the size of the set, k.\n\n**Case 1: k is odd**\nLet k = 2m + 1 for some integer m ≥ 0. The median of S is the unique middle element, s_{m+1}.\n\n*   **For x < s_{m+1}:** There are at most m elements s_i < x and at least m+1 elements s_i > x. Thus, f'(x) = (number of s_i < x) - (number of s_i > x) ≤ m - (m+1) = -1. Since the derivative is negative, the function f(x) is decreasing for x < s_{m+1}.\n*   **For x > s_{m+1}:** There are at least m+1 elements s_i < x and at most m elements s_i > x. Thus, f'(x) = (number of s_i < x) - (number of s_i > x) ≥ (m+1) - m = 1. Since the derivative is positive, the function f(x) is increasing for x > s_{m+1}.\n\nSince f(x) decreases for all x < s_{m+1} and increases for all x > s_{m+1}, it attains its unique minimum at x = s_{m+1}.\n\n**Case 2: k is even**\nLet k = 2m for some integer m ≥ 1. Any point in the closed interval [s_m, s_{m+1}] is considered a median.\n\n*   **For x < s_m:** There are at most m-1 elements s_i < x and at least m+1 elements s_i > x. The derivative f'(x) is negative, so f(x) is decreasing.\n*   **For x > s_{m+1}:** There are at least m+1 elements s_i < x and at most m-1 elements s_i > x. The derivative f'(x) is positive, so f(x) is increasing.\n*   **For x ∈ (s_m, s_{m+1}):** There are exactly m elements s_i < x (namely s₁, ..., s_m) and exactly m elements s_i > x (namely s_{m+1}, ..., s_{2m}). Thus, f'(x) = m - m = 0. This means the function f(x) is constant on the interval (s_m, s_{m+1}).\n\nSince f(x) is decreasing for x < s_m, constant for x ∈ (s_m, s_{m+1}), and increasing for x > s_{m+1}, the minimum value of f(x) is achieved for any x in the closed interval [s_m, s_{m+1}].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe function f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k |x - s_i| is minimized at the median(s) of the set S.\n*   If k is odd, the unique minimizer is the median x = s_{(k+1)/2}.\n*   If k is even, the minimizers are all points in the median interval x ∈ [s_{k/2}, s_{k/2+1}].\n\nfinal:For a finite set S = {s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₖ} of real numbers, the median minimizes f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k |x - s_i|."

The minimum of f(x) occurs where its derivative changes sign from negative to positive.\n\nWe consider two cases based on the size of the set, k.\n\n**Case 1: k is odd**\nLet k = 2m + 1 for some integer m ≥ 0. The median of S is the unique middle element, s_{m+1}.\n\n*   **For x < s_{m+1}:** There are at most m elements s_i < x and at least m+1 elements s_i > x. Thus, f'(x) = (number of s_i < x) - (number of s_i > x) ≤ m - (m+1) = -1. Since the derivative is negative, the function f(x) is decreasing for x < s_{m+1}.\n*   **For x > s_{m+1}:** There are at least m+1 elements s_i < x and at most m elements s_i > x. Thus, f'(x) = (number of s_i < x) - (number of s_i > x) ≥ (m+1) - m = 1. Since the derivative is positive, the function f(x) is increasing for x > s_{m+1}.\n\nSince f(x) decreases for all x < s_{m+1} and increases for all x > s_{m+1}, it attains its unique minimum at x = s_{m+1}.\n\n**Case 2: k is even**\nLet k = 2m for some integer m ≥ 1. Any point in the closed interval [s_m, s_{m+1}] is considered a median.\n\n*   **For x < s_m:** There are at most m-1 elements s_i < x and at least m+1 elements s_i > x. The derivative f'(x) is negative, so f(x) is decreasing.\n*   **For x > s_{m+1}:** There are at least m+1 elements s_i < x and at most m-1 elements s_i > x. The derivative f'(x) is positive, so f(x) is increasing.\n*   **For x ∈ (s_m, s_{m+1}):** There are exactly m elements s_i < x (namely s₁, ..., s_m) and exactly m elements s_i > x (namely s_{m+1}, ..., s_{2m}). Thus, f'(x) = m - m = 0. This means the function f(x) is constant on the interval (s_m, s_{m+1}).\n\nSince f(x) is decreasing for x < s_m, constant for x ∈ (s_m, s_{m+1}), and increasing for x > s_{m+1}, the minimum value of f(x) is achieved for any x in the closed interval [s_m, s_{m+1}].\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe function f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k |x - s_i| is minimized at the median(s) of the set S.\n*   If k is odd, the unique minimizer is the median x = s_{(k+1)/2}.\n*   If k is even, the minimizers are all points in the median interval x ∈ [s_{k/2}, s_{k/2+1}].\n\nfinal:For a finite set S = {s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₖ} of real numbers, the median minimizes f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^k |x - s_i|."
