This means 2^m ≤ n < 2^{m+1}. Since n > 1, we have m ≥ 1.\n\n**Step 2: Express the sum with a common denominator**\nLet L = lcm(1, 2, ..., n) be the least common multiple of all integers from 1 to n. We can write H_n as a fraction with denominator L:\nH_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k = (∑_{k=1}^n L/k) / L = N/L,\nwhere N = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k. To prove H_n is not an integer, we will show that L does not divide N.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the prime factorization of L**\nThe exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of L (the 2-adic valuation, v₂(L)) is exactly m. This is because the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n is 2^m. Therefore, L can be written as L = 2^m × M, where M is an odd integer. Since m ≥ 1, L is an even number.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity of the terms in the numerator N**\nWe examine the parity of each term L/k in the sum N = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k.\n\n*   **Case 1: k = 2^m**\n    The term is L/k = L/2^m = (2^m × M) / 2^m = M. Since M is odd, this term is odd. By the definition of m, 2^m is the only multiple of 2^m in the range [1, n] (as 2 * 2^m = 2^{m+1} > n). Thus, this is the only term of this form.\n\n*   **Case 2: k ≠ 2^m**\n    For any other integer k in {1, 2, ..., n}, let v₂(k) be the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization. Since k is not the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n, we must have v₂(k) < m.\n    The 2-adic valuation of the term L/k is v₂(L/k) = v₂(L) - v₂(k) = m - v₂(k).\n    Since v₂(k) < m, we have m - v₂(k) ≥ 1. This implies that L/k contains at least one factor of 2, meaning L/k is an even number.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the parity of N**\nThe numerator N is the sum of all terms L/k for k from 1 to n.\nN = (L/1 + L/2 + ... + L/n)\nThis sum consists of exactly one odd term (when k = 2^m) and n-1 even terms. The sum of one odd number and any quantity of even numbers is always odd. Therefore, N is an odd integer.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude that H_n cannot be an integer**\nWe have expressed the harmonic sum as H_n = N/L.\n- The numerator N is an odd integer.\n- The denominator L is an even integer.\n\nAn odd integer cannot be divided by an even integer to produce an integer result. If H_n were an integer K, we would have N = K × L. This would mean an odd number (N) is equal to an even number (K × L), which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, H_n cannot be an integer.\n\nfinal: For any integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k is never an integer."

Equivalently, m = ⌊log₂(n)⌋, so we have 2^m ≤ n < 2^{m+1}.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the common denominator**\nLet L = lcm(1, 2, ..., n) be the least common multiple of all integers from 1 to n. Write H_n with denominator L:\nH_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k = (∑_{k=1}^n L/k)/L = N/L,\nwhere N = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2-adic valuation of L**\nThe 2-adic valuation v₂(L) (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of L) is exactly m. This is because:\n- 2^m ≤ n, so 2^m appears as a factor in one of the numbers 1,2,...,n\n- 2^{m+1} > n, so no multiple of 2^{m+1} appears in 1,2,...,n\n- Therefore, the highest power of 2 dividing any number in {1,2,...,n} is 2^m\n- Since L is the lcm, it must contain exactly 2^m as a factor, but not 2^{m+1}\n\nThus, L = 2^m × M, where M is odd.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity of terms L/k**\nFor each term L/k in the numerator N:\n\nCase 1: When k = 2^m\nL/2^m = M, which is odd.\n\nCase 2: When k ≠ 2^m\nLet v₂(k) be the exponent of 2 in k's prime factorization. Since k ≤ n < 2^{m+1}, we have v₂(k) ≤ m. But since k ≠ 2^m, we actually have v₂(k) ≤ m-1 (because if v₂(k) = m, then k would be a multiple of 2^m, and the only such number ≤ n that is exactly 2^m is 2^m itself).\n\nTherefore, v₂(L/k) = v₂(L) - v₂(k) = m - v₂(k) ≥ m - (m-1) = 1.\nThis means L/k contains at least one factor of 2, so L/k is even.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the parity of N**\nN = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k consists of:\n- Exactly one odd term: when k = 2^m\n- All other (n-1) terms are even\n\nThe sum of one odd number and any number of even numbers is odd. Therefore, N is odd.\n\n**Step 6: Show H_n cannot be an integer**\nWe have H_n = N/L, where:\n- N is odd (from Step 5)\n- L is even (since L contains factor 2^m with m ≥ 1 for n > 1)\n\nIf H_n were an integer, say H_n = K where K is an integer, then we would have N = K × L.\nBut the left side N is odd, while the right side K × L is even (since L is even).\nThis is a contradiction because an odd number cannot equal an even number.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nTherefore, for any integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k cannot be an integer.\n\n**Remark:** The proof crucially uses the fact that for n > 1, there exists a unique maximum power of 2 not exceeding n, and this creates exactly one term with odd numerator when expressing H_n with common denominator L = lcm(1,2,...,n).",
        "final reviewer": "```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": true,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:** Prove that for integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k is never an integer.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet n be an integer greater than 1, and define the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k.\n\n**Step 1: Define key quantities**\nLet m be the largest integer such that 2^m ≤ n. This means 2^m ≤ n < 2^{m+1}. Since n > 1, we have m ≥ 1.\n\n**Step 2: Express the sum with a common denominator**\nLet L = lcm(1, 2, ..., n) be the least common multiple of all integers from 1 to n. We can write H_n as a fraction with denominator L:\nH_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k = (∑_{k=1}^n L/k) / L = N/L,\nwhere N = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k. To prove H_n is not an integer, we will show that L does not divide N.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the prime factorization of L**\nThe exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of L (the 2-adic valuation, v₂(L)) is exactly m. This is because the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n is 2^m. Therefore, L can be written as L = 2^m × M, where M is an odd integer. Since m ≥ 1, L is an even number.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity of the terms in the numerator N**\nWe examine the parity of each term L/k in the sum N = ∑_{k=1}^n L/k.\n\n*   **Case 1: k = 2^m**\n    The term is L/k = L/2^m = (2^m × M) / 2^m = M. Since M is odd, this term is odd. By the definition of m, 2^m is the only multiple of 2^m in the range [1, n] (as 2 * 2^m = 2^{m+1} > n). Thus, this is the only term of this form.\n\n*   **Case 2: k ≠ 2^m**\n    For any other integer k in {1, 2, ..., n}, let v₂(k) be the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization. Since k is not the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n, we must have v₂(k) < m.\n    The 2-adic valuation of the term L/k is v₂(L/k) = v₂(L) - v₂(k) = m - v₂(k).\n    Since v₂(k) < m, we have m - v₂(k) ≥ 1. This implies that L/k contains at least one factor of 2, meaning L/k is an even number.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the parity of N**\nThe numerator N is the sum of all terms L/k for k from 1 to n.\nN = (L/1 + L/2 + ... + L/n)\nThis sum consists of exactly one odd term (when k = 2^m) and n-1 even terms. The sum of one odd number and any quantity of even numbers is always odd. Therefore, N is an odd integer.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude that H_n cannot be an integer**\nWe have expressed the harmonic sum as H_n = N/L.\n- The numerator N is an odd integer.\n- The denominator L is an even integer.\n\nAn odd integer cannot be divided by an even integer to produce an integer result. If H_n were an integer K, we would have N = K × L. This would mean an odd number (N) is equal to an even number (K × L), which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, H_n cannot be an integer.\n\nfinal: For any integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1/k is never an integer."
