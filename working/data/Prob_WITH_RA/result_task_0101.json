    "Content":"In my introductory Analysis course, we learned two definitions of continuity. $(1)$ A function $f:E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is continuous at $a$ if every sequence $(z_n) \\in E$ such that $z_n \\to a$ satisfies $f(z_n) \\to f(a)$ . $(2)$ A function $f:E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is continuous at $a$ if $\\forall \\varepsilon>0, \\exists \\delta >0:\\forall z \\in E, |z-a|<\\delta \\implies |f(z)-f(a)|<\\varepsilon$ . The implication $(2)\\implies(1)$ is trivial (though I will happily post a proof if there is sufficient interest).  The proof of the implication $(1)\\implies(2)$ is worth remarking on, though. Proof that $(1)\\implies(2)$ : Suppose on the contrary that $\\exists \\varepsilon>0:\\forall \\delta>0, \\exists z \\in E:\\left (|z-a|<\\delta \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; |f(z)-f(a)|\\ge \\varepsilon\\right )$ .  Let $A_n$ be the set $\\{z\\in E:|z-a|<\\frac{1}{n} \\; \\mathrm{ and }\\; |f(z)-f(a)|\\ge\\varepsilon\\}$ .  Now use the Axiom of Choice to construct a sequence $(z_n)$ with $z_n \\in A_n \\; \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ .  But now $a-\\frac{1}{n}<z_n<a+\\frac{1}{n}\\; \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ so $z_n \\to a$ .  So $f(z_n) \\to f(a)$ .  But $|f(z_n)-f(a)|\\ge\\varepsilon\\; \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ , which is a contradiction. You will have noticed that the above proof uses the Axiom of Choice (the lecturer didn't explicitly spell out the dependence, but it's definitely there).  My question is: is it possible to prove that $(1) \\implies (2)$ without using the Axiom of Choice.  I strongly suspect that it isn't.  In that case, can anyone prove that we have to use the Axiom of Choice?  I can think of three ways to do this: (A) Show that $\\left( (1) \\implies (2)\\right)\\implies \\mathrm{AC}$ . I suspect that this statement is untrue. This is definitely untrue, as Arthur points out, because I only used the axiom of countable choice, which is strictly weaker than AC. (B) Show that $(1)\\implies (2)$ is equivalent to some other statement known to require the Axiom of Choice (the obvious example being the well-ordering of the real numbers). (C) Construct or show the existence of a model of ZF in which there exist sequences which satisfy $(1)$ but not $(2)$ . Of course, if anyone can think of another way, I would be very interested to hear about it. One final note - I am aware that very many theorems in Analysis use the Axiom of Choice in one way or another, and that this is just one example of such a theorem.  If there exists a model of ZF like the one described in (C), is the study of Analysis in that model interesting?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Part of your observation is indeed correct. The axiom of choice is needed, although not in its entire power. The first model of ZF without the axiom of choice, known as Cohen's first model , is one where there exists an infinite Dedekind-finite set of reals. We say that a set is Dedekind-finite if it has no infinitely-countable subset, indeed it is consistent without the axiom of choice that such infinite sets exist, and Cohen's model is an example of a model in which such set exists within the real numbers, let us call it $D$ . First we observe that if $a_n$ is a sequence of elements from $D$ then as a set $\\{a_n\\mid n\\in\\mathbb N\\}$ is finite, otherwise we would have a countably infinite subset of $D$ . If so every weakly decreasing\/increasing sequence in $D$ is eventually constant. It also holds that there is at least one accumulation point of $D$ (within $D$ , that is). Otherwise we could have separated all the points by disjoint intervals and would then reach the conclusion that $D$ is at most countable. Let $S=D\\setminus\\{a\\}$ for some accumulation point $a$ in $D$ . Now consider $f\\colon D\\to\\mathbb R$ define as: $$f(x)=\\begin{cases}1 & x=a\\\\ 0 &x\\neq a\\end{cases}$$ This function is not continuous at $a$ for obvious reasons, for $\\varepsilon=\\frac12$ we have that for $\\delta>0$ we have some $d\\in S$ such that $|d-a|<\\delta$ we still have $|f(d)-f(a)|=1>\\varepsilon$ . However, given a sequence $a_n$ whose limit is $a$ then the sequence is eventually constantly $a$ , therefore $f(a_n)=f(a)=1$ for almost all $n$ . Note that if we assume that $f\\colon\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R$ is continuous at $x$ , and $x_n$ is a sequence approaching $x$ then indeed $f(x_n)$ approaches $f(x)$ . Suppose not, then there is some $\\varepsilon>0$ that for large enough $n$ we have $|f(x)-f(x_n)|>\\varepsilon$ , then for every $\\delta>0$ we can find $n$ such that $|x-x_n|<\\delta$ , which contradicts the $\\varepsilon$ - $\\delta$ continuity at $x$ . On the other hand, assuming that for a given point $x$ continuity at $x$ equals sequential continuity there is far from the axiom of choice. Why? Note that we really just need countable choice to assert the equivalence, and it is quite simple to construct models in which the axiom of choice does not hold but the axiom of countable choice holds. Indeed we know that the assertion: $f\\colon\\mathbb R\\to\\mathbb R$ is continuous at a point $x$ if and only if it is sequentially continuous at that point. Is equivalent to the axiom of countable choice for subsets of the real line; and I suppose we can use that to deduce the same for complex valued functions quite easily. I should also add the following: If the equivalence between the two forms of continuity does not hold it means that the axiom of countable choice does not hold. In turn we cannot ensure that countable unions of countable sets are still countable; this allows great difficulties in ensuring that real analysis works as we are familiar with it. However, there are interesting models for analysis where the axiom of choice does not hold. Solovay's model in which every set is Lebesgue measurable (and much much more) is such model. Just today I ran into a relatively old paper speaking excitingly about \"Solovayan functional analysis\" which will be a new and exciting field. With gratitude to Brian pointing out that continuity everywhere is still equivalent to sequential continuity everywhere; but not when we require a function to be continuous at a certain point (the counterexample in the Dedekind-finite set would be a function which is not continuous everywhere).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to tackle this. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The original question is about whether the implication (1) implies (2) in continuity definitions requires the Axiom of Choice (AC). The example provided shows that the proof uses AC, specifically countable choice, and the user is asking if AC is necessary here.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original question and extract the assumptions and the problem statement. The user mentioned that in the example, the assumptions were listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So let's look at the original problem here.\n\nThe problem discusses two definitions of continuity:\n1. Sequential continuity: For every sequence converging to a, the function values converge to f(a).\n2. Epsilon-delta continuity: The standard definition with epsilon and delta.\n\nThe user states that (2) implies (1) is trivial, but (1) implies (2) uses the Axiom of Choice in the proof. The main question is whether AC is necessary for this implication, and if so, how to show that.\n\nSo the problem is to determine if the implication (1) ⇒ (2) can be proven without AC, or if AC is required. The user also mentions possible approaches to proving the necessity of AC, like showing equivalence to a statement requiring AC or constructing a ZF model where (1) holds but (2) fails.\n\nNow, the task is to structure this into the specified format. The assumptions should list all conditions, each on one line. Looking at the problem, the key assumptions are the two definitions of continuity and the use of AC in the given proof. However, the problem isn't under any specific constraints except that the function is from E to the complex numbers, and the definitions are given. Wait, the problem's context is in analysis, dealing with functions from E (presumably a subset of complex numbers) to the complex numbers. But in the assumptions, maybe we need to list the properties given in the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, perhaps the assumptions are the two definitions of continuity (1) and (2), and that the function is from E to the complex numbers.\n\nBut the original problem's main point is whether the implication (1) ⇒ (2) requires AC. So the problem as stated is: \"Is it possible to prove that (1) implies (2) without using the Axiom of Choice?\" And if not, can we show that AC is necessary?\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the two definitions of continuity and the context in which the function is defined. Let me check:\n\nOriginal question says: In my introductory Analysis course, we learned two definitions of continuity. (1) ... (2) ... The implication (2) ⇒ (1) is trivial. The proof of (1) ⇒ (2) uses AC. The question is: can we prove (1) ⇒ (2) without AC?\n\nSo the key assumptions here are:\n\n- The function f: E → ℂ is considered.\n- Continuity is defined via sequential convergence (definition 1).\n- Continuity is also defined via epsilon-delta (definition 2).\n- The proof provided for (1) ⇒ (2) uses the Axiom of Choice.\n\nBut in the example given, the assumptions were about the variables in the problem. Here, the problem is more about the logical implication between two definitions, given certain set-theoretic axioms. So perhaps the assumptions should list the properties of the function and the definitions, but I need to follow the example's structure where each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- f is a function from E to the complex numbers.\n- Continuity at a point a is defined via sequential convergence (definition 1).\n- Continuity at a point a is defined via epsilon-delta (definition 2).\n- The Axiom of Choice is used in the provided proof of (1) ⇒ (2).\n\nBut the problem is not assuming that AC is true, but rather asking if the implication requires AC. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking whether AC is necessary. So perhaps the assumptions are more about the framework (ZF set theory without AC?), but maybe the problem is presented in the standard ZFC context.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions constructing a model of ZF where (1) holds but (2) fails. So the assumptions are that we're working within ZF set theory, and the question is about the necessity of AC in proving the implication.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions for structuring the problem are the two definitions of continuity. So each definition is an assumption. Then the problem is whether one implies the other without AC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in the context where the user has shown that (1) implies (2) using AC, and now wants to know if AC is necessary. So the assumptions are the definitions and the use of AC in the given proof.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions should list the conditions given in the problem. The example had the problem statement with A(n) defined, and the assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this case, the problem's assumptions would be the definitions (1) and (2) of continuity, and the fact that the function is from E to ℂ. Let's try:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n- For every sequence $(z_n) \\in E$ converging to $a$, $f(z_n)$ converges to $f(a)$,\n- For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $z \\in E$, $|z - a| < \\delta$ implies $|f(z) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon$,\n- The Axiom of Choice is used in the proof that (1) implies (2).\n\nBut wait, the third point is the definition (2), which is part of the problem's context. However, the problem is not assuming that both (1) and (2) are given, but rather that (1) is given and the implication to (2) is to be proven. The question is whether AC is necessary for this proof.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the two definitions of continuity and the function's domain and codomain. Then the problem is to determine if (1) implies (2) necessarily requires AC.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were about the variables and conditions in the problem. Here, the problem is more meta, about the set-theoretic axioms needed for a proof. However, the user wants the assumptions listed as per the problem's setup.\n\nWait, the original problem states: \"My question is: is it possible to prove that (1) ⇒ (2) without using the Axiom of Choice. I strongly suspect that it isn't. In that case, can anyone prove that we have to use the Axiom of Choice?\"\n\nSo the problem is to determine the necessity of AC in proving the implication from sequential continuity to epsilon-delta continuity.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be the two definitions of continuity, and the problem is whether AC is required for the implication.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific conditions on the variables (n is integer, divisible by 7). Here, the problem is more about the logical dependency between definitions and AC. However, the definitions are part of the problem's setup.\n\nSo structuring this:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity at $a$ is defined by sequential convergence (definition 1),\nContinuity at $a$ is defined by the epsilon-delta criterion (definition 2),\nThe proof of (1) ⇒ (2) provided uses the Axiom of Choice.\n\nProblem:\nIs it possible to prove that (1) implies (2) without using the Axiom of Choice? If not, show that the Axiom of Choice is necessary.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem part is concise. In the example, it's \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should be phrased as a question to prove or determine something.\n\nThe original question is asking whether AC is needed for the implication. So the problem statement would be: \"Determine whether the implication (1) ⇒ (2) can be proven without the Axiom of Choice, or if the Axiom of Choice is necessarily required.\"\n\nBut the user's example used \"Prove that...\", so maybe here it's similar. However, the original question is a yes\/no question, but with a request for a proof of necessity if the answer is that AC is required.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as: \"Is the Axiom of Choice required to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$?\"\n\nTherefore, combining this:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n- Continuity at $a$ is defined by sequential convergence (for every sequence $(z_n) \\to a$, $f(z_n) \\to f(a)$),\n- Continuity at $a$ is defined by the epsilon-delta criterion.\n\nProblem:\nIs the Axiom of Choice necessary to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity?\n\nAlternatively, since the original proof uses AC, the problem is whether AC is required, so:\n\nProblem:\nProve or determine whether the implication (1) ⇒ (2) (from sequential continuity to epsilon-delta continuity) requires the Axiom of Choice.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem part should be a direct statement. Maybe:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove that a function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ sequentially continuous at $a$ is also epsilon-delta continuous at $a$.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is a single line. Let me check the example again:\n\nIn the example, the assumptions are two lines: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. The problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nSo here, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem, not the definitions. The problem is to prove something under those assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question is about whether AC is necessary for the implication between two definitions. The definitions are part of the problem's setup, so they should be listed as assumptions.\n\nSo, the assumptions would be:\n\n- $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n- $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$ (definition 1),\n- $f$ is epsilon-delta continuous at $a$ (definition 2),\n- The implication (1) ⇒ (2) is proven using the Axiom of Choice.\n\nWait, but the last point is part of the problem's context, not an assumption. The user's proof uses AC, and the question is whether AC is necessary. So perhaps the assumptions are the first three points, but the fourth is part of the problem's background.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is to determine the necessity of AC in proving (1) ⇒ (2), given that in ZF set theory, with the definitions as stated.\n\nHmm, this is a bit more abstract. The example given was more concrete, with assumptions on n. Here, the problem is more about the logical foundations. However, following the example's structure, perhaps:\n\nAssumptions:\n- $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n- For every sequence $(z_n) \\in E$ converging to $a$, $f(z_n) converges to $f(a)$,\n- The Axiom of Choice is not used.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that for every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $z \\in E$, $|z - a| < \\delta$ implies $|f(z) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBut the original problem is not to reprove the implication without AC, but to determine whether AC is necessary. So perhaps the problem is phrased as a question:\n\nProblem:\nIs the Axiom of Choice necessary to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$?\n\nBut the example uses an imperative statement (\"Prove that...\"), so maybe here it should be similar, but as a question. However, the format requires \"Problem: <The problem>\". The example's problem is \"Prove that...\", so maybe here it's \"Determine whether...\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be phrased as \"Does the implication (1) ⇒ (2) require the Axiom of Choice?\".\n\nBut the user's original question is: \"My question is: is it possible to prove that (1) ⇒ (2) without using the Axiom of Choice. I strongly suspect that it isn't. In that case, can anyone prove that we have to use the Axiom of Choice?\"\n\nSo the problem is twofold: first, is AC needed, and if so, prove that it is. However, the example has a single problem statement, so perhaps the problem is: \"Prove whether the implication (1) ⇒ (2) for continuity requires the Axiom of Choice.\"\n\nBut in the example, the problem is a statement to prove. Here, it's a meta-question about the necessity of an axiom. So perhaps the problem should be framed as:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the implication from sequential continuity to epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ requires the Axiom of Choice.\n\nBut the original question is asking whether this is the case, so it's more of a question than a statement to prove. But the format requires the problem to be stated as a directive. Maybe:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove that a sequentially continuous function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is epsilon-delta continuous.\n\nAlternatively, since the user wants to know if it's possible without AC and, if not, to show that AC is required, the problem could be:\n\nProblem:\nIs the Axiom of Choice required to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$? If yes, prove its necessity.\n\nBut the example's problem was concise. Let me look again.\n\nOriginal example's formatted problem:\n\nAssumption: \n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by $7$.\nProblem:\nProve that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nSo the assumptions are the conditions on n, and the problem is to prove a property of A(n).\n\nIn the current case, the assumptions would be the setup of the function and the two continuity definitions. But the problem is not to prove continuity but to determine the necessity of AC.\n\nHowever, since the original problem is a question about the necessity of AC in a proof, perhaps the assumptions are the definitions and the problem is whether AC is needed.\n\nSo structured as:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined via sequential convergence,\nContinuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined via the epsilon-delta criterion,\nThe implication (1) ⇒ (2) is proven using the Axiom of Choice.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether the Axiom of Choice is necessary for the implication (1) ⇒ (2).\n\nBut the example's assumptions are properties of the variables in the problem, not the definitions. Maybe I should separate the definitions as part of the problem's context and the assumptions as the given conditions.\n\nWait, in the example, the assumptions are about n: being an integer and divisible by 7. The problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nIn the current problem, the definitions (1) and (2) are part of the problem's context, not assumptions on specific objects. However, the user wants assumptions listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is sequentially continuous at $a$ (i.e., satisfies definition (1)),\n- The Axiom of Choice is not used in the proof.\n\nBut the problem is whether the epsilon-delta continuity (definition (2)) follows under these assumptions. Alternatively, the problem is to determine if, assuming sequential continuity, epsilon-delta continuity can be proven without AC.\n\nBut the original problem's core is: given that in ZF set theory (without AC), is the implication (1) ⇒ (2) provable? Or does it require AC?\n\nTherefore, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory axioms (without the Axiom of Choice),\n- The function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $f$ is epsilon-delta continuous at $a$.\n\nBut the original question is whether AC is required, so the problem is more about the necessity. However, structuring this into the format might require specifying the problem as determining the necessity of AC.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, the format should have \"Problem: <The problem>\". The example's problem is a statement to prove. Here, the problem is a question about the necessity of an axiom in a proof. Since the example uses a statement to prove, maybe the problem here is \"Prove that the Axiom of Choice is necessary to show that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity.\"\n\nBut the original question is whether it's necessary, so perhaps the problem is to prove that necessity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as:\n\nAssumption:\nIn ZF set theory (without AC),\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is sequentially continuous at $a$,\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $f$ is epsilon-delta continuous at $a$.\n\nBut this changes the original question slightly. The original question is not to prove or disprove the implication in ZF, but to determine whether AC is necessary for the proof.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to follow the structure as in the example, listing the key elements of the problem setup as assumptions and then phrasing the problem.\n\nThe original problem discusses two definitions of continuity, the implication (1) ⇒ (2) using AC, and asks if AC is necessary. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity at $a$ is defined by sequential convergence (definition (1)),\nContinuity at $a$ is defined by the epsilon-delta criterion (definition (2)),\nThe proof of (1) ⇒ (2) uses the Axiom of Choice.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove that (1) implies (2).\n\nBut the example's problem is a statement to prove, not a question. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the example, which uses \"Prove that...\". The original question here is a yes\/no question but the format requires a problem statement. Perhaps rephrase the problem as:\n\nProblem:\nProve whether the Axiom of Choice is necessary to establish that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAlternatively, since the example uses a direct statement, maybe:\n\nProblem:\nProve that the implication from sequential continuity to epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ requires the Axiom of Choice.\n\nBut the original question is asking whether this is the case, not asserting it. However, the example's problem is a direct assertion to prove. Given that, perhaps the problem statement here is to determine the role of AC, but phrased as a directive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is as stated in the original question: \"Is it possible to prove that (1) ⇒ (2) without using the Axiom of Choice?\" But the example uses an imperative, so perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nI think this is acceptable. The assumptions list the setup (the function, the two definitions, and the use of AC in the given proof), and the problem is to determine if AC is necessary.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions are about n, and the problem is to prove a property about A(n). Here, the assumptions are about the function and definitions, and the problem is a meta-question about the necessity of an axiom.\n\nBut following the user's instructions, the answer should be in the specified format. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined by sequential convergence,\nContinuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined by the epsilon-delta criterion,\nThe proof of $(1) \\implies (2)$ provided uses the Axiom of Choice.\n\nProblem:\nDetermine if the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity.\n\nBut the user's example uses two assumptions, each a single line. Here, I have four assumptions. Let me check if each is one property applied to one object.\n\n1. The first assumption is about the function f: its domain and codomain.\n2. The second is about the definition of continuity at a via sequences.\n3. The third is about the definition via epsilon-delta.\n4. The fourth is about the proof using AC.\n\nBut the fourth assumption is about the proof, not a condition on the function or the space. Perhaps that's part of the problem's context rather than an assumption. The problem is asking whether AC is necessary, given that the known proof uses AC.\n\nSo maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n- $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$,\n- The Axiom of Choice is not used in the proof.\n\nProblem:\nProve or disprove that $f$ is epsilon-delta continuous at $a$.\n\nBut this changes the original question. The original question is not to reprove without AC but to determine if AC is necessary.\n\nGiven the user's example, perhaps the problem should be phrased as a statement to prove, incorporating the necessity of AC. So:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity at $a$ is defined by sequential convergence.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the Axiom of Choice is necessary to establish the epsilon-delta continuity of $f$ at $a$.\n\nBut the problem is whether AC is necessary, not to prove it's necessary. The user is asking for a proof of the necessity.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be:\n\nProblem:\nShow that the Axiom of Choice is required to prove that sequential continuity implies epsilon-delta continuity for functions $f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThis seems to fit the example's structure better, as a directive.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\nContinuity of $f$ at $a$ is defined via convergence of sequences,\nThe Axiom of Choice is not used.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the Axiom of Choice is necessary to prove the epsilon-delta continuity of $f$ at $a$.\n\nBut the problem is to show the necessity, which would involve constructing a model where the implication fails without AC. The original question mentions approach (C): constructing a ZF model where (1) holds but (2) fails.\n\nHowever, the assumptions should only list the conditions given in the problem, not the methods to solve it. The example's assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the methods.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best way to structure this is:\n\nAssumption:\n$f: E \\to \\mathbb{C}$ is a function,\n$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$,\nThe proof of $(1) \\implies (2)$ provided uses the Axiom of Choice.\n\nProblem:\nProve whether the Axiom of Choice is necessary to establish the epsilon-delta continuity of $f$ at $a$.\n\nBut the example's assumptions were two lines, each about one property. Here, we have three assumptions. However, the third one is about the proof's use of AC, which is part of the problem's context.\n\nAlternatively, considering the original problem's title and content, the key elements are the two definitions of continuity and the use of AC.

This means that for any $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta_0$, we must have $x = a$.\n\nNow, to show $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$:\n- Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary.\n- Choose $\\delta = \\delta_0$ (from the isolation property).\n- For any $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta$, we have $x = a$ (by the isolation property).\n- Then $f(x) = f(a) = 1$, so $|f(x) - f(a)| = |1 - 1| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\nThus, in Case 1, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\nMoreover, in this case, $f$ is also sequentially continuous at $a$:\n- Let $(z_n)$ be any sequence in $E$ with $z_n \\to a$.\n- Since $a$ is isolated, for sufficiently large $n$, we must have $z_n = a$ (otherwise $z_n$ could not approach $a$ while staying in $E$).\n- Then $f(z_n) = 1 = f(a)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, so $f(z_n) \\to f(a)$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$**\n\nIf $a$ is not isolated in $E$, then for every $\\delta > 0$, the set $B(a, \\delta) \\cap (E \\setminus \\{a\\})$ is nonempty. This means there exist points in $E$ arbitrarily close to $a$ but different from $a$.\n\nIn this case, we claim $f$ is **not** sequentially continuous at $a$:\n- Since $a$ is not isolated, we can construct a sequence $(z_n)$ in $E \\setminus \\{a\\}$ such that $z_n \\to a$. This construction does not require the Axiom of Choice; we can define $z_n$ explicitly by taking points in $E \\cap (a - 1\/n, a + 1\/n) \\setminus \\{a\\}$, which is nonempty by the non-isolation assumption.\n- For this sequence, $f(z_n) = 0$ for all $n$ (since $z_n \\neq a$), while $f(a) = 1$.\n- Thus $f(z_n) \\to 0 \\neq 1 = f(a)$, so $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nNow, consider the implication we need to prove: \"If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\"\n\nIn Case 2, the hypothesis \"$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$\" is **false** (as we just showed). Therefore, the implication is **vacuously true** in Case 2. A conditional statement with a false hypothesis is always true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWe have analyzed all possible cases:\n1. If $a$ is isolated in $E$, then $f$ is both sequentially continuous and $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n2. If $a$ is not isolated in $E$, then $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$, making the implication \"if sequentially continuous then $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous\" vacuously true.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the implication holds: If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\n**Step 4: Avoiding the Axiom of Choice**\n\nThe proof does not require the Axiom of Choice:\n- In Case 1, we use the definition of isolated point and basic properties of continuity.\n- In Case 2, when constructing a sequence $(z_n)$ converging to $a$, we can do this without AC by using the fact that for each $n$, the set $E \\cap (a - 1\/n, a + 1\/n) \\setminus \\{a\\}$ is nonempty (since $a$ is not isolated). We can define $z_n$ by taking, for instance, the infimum of this set if it's bounded below, or use another explicit selection rule. Alternatively, we can argue by contradiction: if no such sequence exists, then $a$ would be isolated.\n\nThus, the proof is complete without invoking the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Final Remark**: The key insight is that for this particular function $f$, sequential continuity forces $a$ to be isolated in $E$, and in that case, $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity follows easily. If $a$ is not isolated, then $f$ cannot be sequentially continuous, making the implication trivially true.",

Prove that if $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$, without using the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe want to prove the implication: If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\nLet's recall the definitions for the function $f$ at point $a \\in E$:\n*   **Sequentially continuous at $a$**: For every sequence $(x_n)$ in $E$ such that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = f(a)$.\n*   **$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$**: For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBy definition of $f$, we have $f(a) = 1$.\n\nWe proceed by considering two exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases for the point $a$ in the set $E$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is an isolated point of $E$.**\nBy definition of an isolated point, there exists a $\\delta_0 > 0$ such that the only point of $E$ in the open interval $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0)$ is $a$ itself. That is, $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0) \\cap E = \\{a\\}$.\n\nIn this case, we can show that $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\nLet $\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Choose $\\delta = \\delta_0$.\nIf $x \\in E$ and $|x - a| < \\delta$, then by our choice of $\\delta$, it must be that $x = a$.\nThen, $|f(x) - f(a)| = |f(a) - f(a)| = |1 - 1| = 0$.\nSince $0 < \\varepsilon$ for any choice of $\\varepsilon > 0$, the condition for $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity is satisfied.\nThus, if $a$ is an isolated point, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$. The implication holds in this case (as the conclusion is true).\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$.**\nIf $a$ is not an isolated point, then for every $\\delta > 0$, the set $(a - \\delta, a + \\delta) \\cap E$ contains at least one point other than $a$. This means we can find points in $E$ arbitrarily close to $a$ that are not equal to $a$.\n\nIn this case, we show that $f$ is **not** sequentially continuous at $a$.\nSince $a$ is not isolated, for each positive integer $n$, the set $(a - 1\/n, a + 1\/n) \\cap E \\setminus \\{a\\}$ is non-empty. We can therefore construct a sequence $(x_n)$ such that for each $n$, $x_n \\in E$, $x_n \\neq a$, and $|x_n - a| < 1\/n$. This construction does not require the Axiom of Choice, as we can define an explicit rule (e.g., for each $n$, pick an element from the non-empty set).\n\nThis sequence $(x_n)$ has the following properties:\n1.  $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $E$.\n2.  $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, since $|x_n - a| < 1\/n$.\n3.  For all $n$, $x_n \\neq a$, which implies $f(x_n) = 0$.\n\nNow we check the limit of $f(x_n)$:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$.\nHowever, $f(a) = 1$.\nSince $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = 0 \\neq 1 = f(a)$, the condition for sequential continuity is not met.\nTherefore, if $a$ is not an isolated point, $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nIn this second case, the hypothesis of the implication (\"$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$\") is false. In classical logic, an implication with a false hypothesis is always true (this is known as a vacuous truth).\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have examined all possibilities.\n*   If $a$ is an isolated point of $E$, the conclusion of the implication is true, so the implication is true.\n*   If $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, the hypothesis of the implication is false, so the implication is true.\n\nIn either case, the statement \"If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$\" holds.
