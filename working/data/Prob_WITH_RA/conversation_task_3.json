This integral is well-defined because e^{-x²} is continuous and decays rapidly as x → ∞.\n\n**Step 2: Square the integral using Fubini's theorem**\nConsider I² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx)(∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy). By Fubini's theorem for non-negative integrands, we can combine these as a double integral:\nI² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} e^{-y²} dx dy = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x² + y²)} dx dy\n\n**Step 3: Convert to polar coordinates**\nWe perform a change of variables from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ):\nx = r cos θ, y = r sin θ\nThe Jacobian determinant for this transformation is:\n|∂(x,y)/∂(r,θ)| = |cos θ  -r sin θ; sin θ  r cos θ| = r cos²θ + r sin²θ = r\nThus, dx dy = r dr dθ.\n\n**Step 4: Determine integration limits**\nSince x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (both integrals are from 0 to ∞), we are integrating over the first quadrant. In polar coordinates:\n- r ranges from 0 to ∞ (distance from origin)\n- θ ranges from 0 to π/2 (first quadrant angle)\nThe integrand becomes e^{-(x²+y²)} = e^{-r²} since x² + y² = r².\n\n**Step 5: Express I² in polar coordinates**\nSubstituting into the double integral:\nI² = ∫_{θ=0}^{π/2} ∫_{r=0}^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the inner integral**\nWe compute ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr using the substitution u = r²:\n- du = 2r dr, so r dr = du/2\n- When r = 0, u = 0\n- When r → ∞, u → ∞\nThus:\n∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr = ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} (du/2) = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = (1/2)[-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = (1/2)[0 - (-1)] = 1/2\n\n**Step 7: Evaluate the outer integral**\nNow I² = ∫₀^{π/2} (1/2) dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^{π/2} dθ = (1/2)[θ]₀^{π/2} = (1/2)(π/2) = π/4\n\n**Step 8: Solve for I**\nSince I² = π/4 and I > 0 (the integrand e^{-x²} is positive for all x), we take the positive square root:\nI = √(π/4) = √π/√4 = √π/2\n\nTherefore, we have proven that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π/2.\n\n**Verification of assumptions:**\n1. The integrand e^{-x²} is continuous on [0,∞), ensuring the integral exists.\n2. Fubini's theorem applies because e^{-(x²+y²)} is non-negative and integrable over the first quadrant.\n3. The polar coordinate transformation is valid as it is a smooth change of variables with non-zero Jacobian (r > 0 for r > 0).\n4. The substitution u = r² is valid as it is a differentiable bijection from [0,∞) to [0,∞).",

This integral is well-defined because e^{-x²} is a positive, continuous function that converges to 0 rapidly as x → ∞.\n\nConsider the square of the integral, I²:\nI² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy)\n\nSince the integrands are non-negative, we can apply Fubini's theorem to combine the product of integrals into a double integral over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane:\nI² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} e^{-y²} dx dy = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x² + y²)} dx dy\n\nWe now convert this double integral from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The transformation is given by:\nx = r cos θ\ny = r sin θ\nThe differential area element dx dy becomes r dr dθ.\n\nThe region of integration is the first quadrant, where x ranges from 0 to ∞ and y ranges from 0 to ∞. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to a radius r ranging from 0 to ∞ and an angle θ ranging from 0 to π/2. The term x² + y² becomes r².\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for I², we get:\nI² = ∫₀^{π/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\n\nFirst, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to r:\n∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr\nLet u = r², so du = 2r dr, which means r dr = du/2. The limits of integration remain 0 to ∞.\n∫₀^∞ e^{-u} (du/2) = (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = (1/2) [-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = (1/2) [(-lim_{u→∞} e^{-u}) - (-e⁻⁰)] = (1/2) [0 - (-1)] = 1/2\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for I² and evaluate the outer integral with respect to θ:\nI² = ∫₀^{π/2} (1/2) dθ = (1/2) [θ]₀^{π/2} = (1/2) (π/2 - 0) = π/4\n\nSo, we have I² = π/4. Since the integrand e^{-x²} is always positive, the integral I must be positive. Taking the positive square root of both sides gives:\nI = √(π/4) = √π/2\n\nTherefore, we have proven that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π/2.\n\nfinal:"
