However, this alone does not establish f(α, β) = f(β, α).\\n\\n**Step 3: Contour Integration Setup**\\n\\nTo prove the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α), we employ contour integration in the complex plane.\\n\\nConsider the function g(z) = z^α/(1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) where z^α = e^{α(ln|z| + i·arg(z))} with the branch cut along the positive real axis.\\n\\nThe poles of g(z) occur when 1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z² = 0, i.e., at z = -e^{±iπβ} = e^{iπ(1±β)}.\\n\\nFor β ∈ (-1, 1):\\n- Pole z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} lies at angle π(1+β) ∈ (0, 2π)\\n- Pole z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)} lies at angle π(1-β) ∈ (0, 2π)\\n\\n**Step 4: Application of Poles (Assumption 4)**\\n\\nUsing Assumption 4, the poles are characterized as p_n^± = ±(ln x/(πi) + 1) + 2n where n ∈ ℤ.\\n\\nFor the principal branch (n = 0), the poles inside a keyhole contour are:\\n- z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} with |z₁| = 1\\n- z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)} with |z₂| = 1\\n\\n**Step 5: Keyhole Contour Construction**\\n\\nConstruct a keyhole contour C consisting of:\\n- γ₁: Along the positive real axis from ε to R (above the branch cut)\\n- γ₂: Large circle of radius R traversed counterclockwise\\n- γ₃: Along the positive real axis from R to ε (below the branch cut)\\n- γ₄: Small circle of radius ε around the origin\\n\\n**Step 6: Residue Calculation**\\n\\nBy the residue theorem:\\n∮_C g(z) dz = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]\\n\\nFor a simple pole at z₀ of the form f(z)/(z - z₀)(z - z₁), the residue is f(z₀)/(z₀ - z₁).\\n\\nAt z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)}:\\nRes(g, z₁) = z₁^α / (z₁ - z₂) = e^{iπα(1+β)} / (e^{iπ(1+β)} - e^{iπ(1-β)})\\n\\nAt z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}:\\nRes(g, z₂) = z₂^α / (z₂ - z₁) = e^{iπα(1-β)} / (e^{iπ(1-β)} - e^{iπ(1+β)})\\n\\n**Step 7: Evaluating Contour Contributions**\\n\\nAs R → ∞ and ε → 0:\\n- ∫_{γ₂} → 0 since |z^α/(1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²)| ~ |z|^{α-2} → 0 for α < 1\\n- ∫_{γ₄} → 0 since |z^α| ~ ε^α → 0 for α > -1\\n\\nThe contributions from γ₁ and γ₃ give:\\n∫_{γ₁} g(z) dz = ∫₀^∞ x^α/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx = f(α, β)\\n∫_{γ₃} g(z) dz = -e^{2πiα} ∫₀^∞ x^α/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx = -e^{2πiα} f(α, β)\\n\\nTherefore:\\n(1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β) = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]\\n\\n**Step 8: Closed-Form Evaluation**\\n\\nThe residues simplify as:\\nRes(g, z₁) = e^{iπα(1+β)} / [e^{iπ(1+β)} - e^{iπ(1-β)}] = e^{iπα(1+β)} / [2i sin(πβ) · e^{iπ}]\\n           = -e^{iπα(1+β)} / [2i sin(πβ)]\\n\\nRes(g, z₂) = e^{iπα(1-β)} / [e^{iπ(1-β)} - e^{iπ(1+β)}] = e^{iπα(1-β)} / [-2i sin(πβ) · e^{iπ}]\\n           = e^{iπα(1-β)} / [2i sin(πβ)]\\n\\nSum of residues:\\nRes(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂) = [e^{iπα(1-β)} - e^{iπα(1+β)}] / [2i sin(πβ)]\\n                        = -e^{iπα} · [e^{iπαβ} - e^{-iπαβ}] / [2i sin(πβ)]\\n                        = -e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)\\n\\nTherefore:\\nf(α, β) = 2πi · [-e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)] / (1 - e^{2πiα})\\n        = 2πi · [-e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)] / [-e^{iπα}(e^{iπα} - e^{-iπα})]\\n        = 2πi · sin(παβ) / [sin(πβ) · 2i sin(πα)]\\n        = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)]\\n\\n**Step 9: Symmetry Verification**\\n\\nThe closed-form result is:\\nf(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)]\\n\\nThis expression is manifestly symmetric in α and β:\\n- The numerator sin(παβ) = sin(πβα) is symmetric\\n- The denominator sin(πα) · sin(πβ) = sin(πβ) · sin(πα) is symmetric\\n\\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\\n\\nSince f(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)] = f(β, α), we have established the symmetry:\\n\\n**f(α, β) = f(β, α)**\\n\\nThe role of Assumption 4 (defining the poles) was essential because it enabled the contour integration approach that yielded the closed-form expression, from which the symmetry is immediately apparent. Without contour integration, the symmetry is not obvious from the integral definition alone, as simple substitution only shows f(α, β) = f(-α, β), not f(α, β) = f(β, α). ∎\"\n}\n```"

Contour Integration Setup**\\nWe define a complex function g(z) = z^α / (1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) and use a keyhole contour C around the positive real axis, which serves as the branch cut for z^α. The poles of g(z) are the roots of the denominator, z² + 2z cos(πβ) + 1 = 0. These are simple poles located at z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} and z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}. For α, β ∈ (-1, 1), both poles lie inside the contour.\\n\\n**2. Residue Calculation**\\nBy the Residue Theorem, the contour integral is ∮_C g(z) dz = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]. The sum of the residues is calculated as:\\nSum = [e^{iπα(1-β)} - e^{iπα(1+β)}] / (2i sin(πβ)) = -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)\\n\\n**3. Contour Integral Evaluation**\\nThe integrals over the circular parts of the contour vanish as their radii tend to ∞ and 0, respectively, given that α ∈ (-1, 1). The integrals along the real axis, above and below the branch cut, combine to yield:\\n∮_C g(z) dz = (1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β)\\n\\n**4. Derivation of the Closed Form**\\nEquating the two expressions for the contour integral gives:\\n(1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β) = 2πi * [ -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ) ]\\nUsing the identity 1 - e^{2πiα} = -e^{iπα}(2i sin(πα)), we solve for f(α, β):\\nf(α, β) = π * sin(παβ) / (sin(πα) sin(πβ))\\n\\n**5. Conclusion**\\nThe derived closed-form expression, f(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)], is manifestly symmetric in α and β because both the numerator and the denominator are symmetric with respect to the interchange of α and β.\\n\\nTherefore, we have proven that **f(α, β) = f(β, α)**. ∎\"\n}\n```"

Let its dimension be `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. This implies that there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ. By the definition of a basis, every real number `x` can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors with coefficients in ℚ:\n    x = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ, where q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ ∈ ℚ.\n\n2.  **Establish a bijection between ℝ and ℚⁿ.**\n    The unique representation of each `x` ∈ ℝ as a linear combination of the basis vectors defines a mapping φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ given by:\n    φ(x) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ).\n    This mapping is a vector space isomorphism, and therefore it is a bijection. A bijection between two sets implies that they have the same cardinality. Thus, |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of ℚⁿ.**\n    The set of rational numbers, ℚ, is countable. A fundamental result in set theory states that the finite Cartesian product of countable sets is itself countable. Since ℚⁿ is the product of `n` copies of ℚ, ℚⁿ is a countable set. This means its cardinality is equal to that of the natural numbers, |ℚⁿ| = |ℕ| = ℵ₀.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality of ℝ.**\n    It is a well-established theorem, originally proven by Georg Cantor, that the set of real numbers, ℝ, is uncountable. This means that there is no bijection between ℝ and ℕ, and its cardinality is strictly greater than that of the natural numbers: |ℝ| > ℵ₀.\n\n5.  **Derive the contradiction.**\n    From our steps above, we have concluded:\n    - From the assumption of finite-dimensionality: |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n    - From the countability of ℚⁿ: |ℚⁿ| = ℵ₀.\n    - From the uncountability of ℝ: |ℝ| > ℵ₀.\n\n    Combining these results, we get |ℝ| = ℵ₀ and |ℝ| > ℵ₀. This is a contradiction, as a number cannot be equal to and strictly greater than itself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Our initial assumption that ℝ is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℚ must be false.

Contour Integration Setup**\\nWe define a complex function g(z) = z^α / (1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) and use a keyhole contour C around the positive real axis, which serves as the branch cut for z^α. The poles of g(z) are the roots of the denominator, z² + 2z cos(πβ) + 1 = 0. These are simple poles located at z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} and z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}. For α, β ∈ (-1, 1), both poles lie inside the contour.\\n\\n**2. Residue Calculation**\\nBy the Residue Theorem, the contour integral is ∮_C g(z) dz = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]. The sum of the residues is calculated as:\\nSum = [e^{iπα(1-β)} - e^{iπα(1+β)}] / (2i sin(πβ)) = -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)\\n\\n**3. Contour Integral Evaluation**\\nThe integrals over the circular parts of the contour vanish as their radii tend to ∞ and 0, respectively, given that α ∈ (-1, 1). The integrals along the real axis, above and below the branch cut, combine to yield:\\n∮_C g(z) dz = (1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β)\\n\\n**4. Derivation of the Closed Form**\\nEquating the two expressions for the contour integral gives:\\n(1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β) = 2πi * [ -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ) ]\\nUsing the identity 1 - e^{2πiα} = -e^{iπα}(2i sin(πα)), we solve for f(α, β):\\nf(α, β) = π * sin(παβ) / (sin(πα) sin(πβ))\\n\\n**5. Conclusion**\\nThe derived closed-form expression, f(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)], is manifestly symmetric in α and β because both the numerator and the denominator are symmetric with respect to the interchange of α and β.\\n\\nTherefore, we have proven that **f(α, β) = f(β, α)**. ∎\"\n}\n```"

Let its dimension be `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. This implies that there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ. By the definition of a basis, every real number `x` can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors with coefficients in ℚ:\n    x = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ, where q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ ∈ ℚ.\n\n2.  **Establish a bijection between ℝ and ℚⁿ.**\n    The unique representation of each `x` ∈ ℝ as a linear combination of the basis vectors defines a mapping φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ given by:\n    φ(x) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ).\n    This mapping is a vector space isomorphism, and therefore it is a bijection. A bijection between two sets implies that they have the same cardinality. Thus, |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of ℚⁿ.**\n    The set of rational numbers, ℚ, is countable. A fundamental result in set theory states that the finite Cartesian product of countable sets is itself countable. Since ℚⁿ is the product of `n` copies of ℚ, ℚⁿ is a countable set. This means its cardinality is equal to that of the natural numbers, |ℚⁿ| = |ℕ| = ℵ₀.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality of ℝ.**\n    It is a well-established theorem, originally proven by Georg Cantor, that the set of real numbers, ℝ, is uncountable.

This means there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ such that every real number can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination:\n\nx = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ, where q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ ∈ ℚ.\n\n**Step 2: Establish isomorphism with ℚⁿ**\nIf ℝ has dimension n over ℚ, then ℝ is isomorphic to ℚⁿ as vector spaces over ℚ. This isomorphism φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ is given by:\n\nφ(x) = φ(q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ).\n\nSince φ is a bijective linear transformation, ℝ ≅ ℚⁿ as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\n**Step 3: Show ℚⁿ is countable**\nℚⁿ is the Cartesian product of n copies of ℚ. Since ℚ is countable (we can enumerate rational numbers as q₁, q₂, q₃, ...), and the finite product of countable sets is countable, ℚⁿ is countable. More formally:\n\n- ℚ is countable, so there exists a bijection f: ℕ → ℚ.\n- For ℚⁿ, we can construct a bijection g: ℕ → ℚⁿ using Cantor's pairing function or diagonal enumeration.\n- Therefore, ℚⁿ is countable.\n\n**Step 4: ℝ is uncountable**\nBy Cantor's diagonal argument (or the well-known result), ℝ is uncountable. There is no bijection between ℝ and ℕ. In fact, |ℝ| = 2^{ℵ₀} > ℵ₀ = |ℕ|.\n\n**Step 5: Derive contradiction**\nFrom Step 2, ℝ ≅ ℚⁿ, so |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|. From Step 3, ℚⁿ is countable, so |ℚⁿ| = ℵ₀. From Step 4, ℝ is uncountable, so |ℝ| > ℵ₀. This gives:\n\nℵ₀ = |ℚⁿ| = |ℝ| > ℵ₀,\n\nwhich is a contradiction (ℵ₀ > ℵ₀ is false).\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nOur assumption that ℝ is finite-dimensional over ℚ leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ℝ cannot be finite-dimensional over ℚ. Hence, ℝ must be infinite-dimensional as a vector space over ℚ.\n\n**Additional remarks:**\n1. The proof relies on the fundamental fact that ℝ is uncountable while ℚⁿ is countable for any finite n.\n2. This shows that any basis for ℝ over ℚ must be uncountably infinite.\n3. The existence of a basis for ℝ over ℚ (a Hamel basis) requires the Axiom of Choice, but the proof of infinite dimensionality does not depend on constructing an actual basis, only on the impossibility of a finite basis.",

The commentary in the proof incorrectly states this assumption was essential. After removing this flawed assumption, the proof is valid.\\n\\n**Corrected Problem:**\\n\\nGiven:\\n1) α ∈ (-1, 1)\\n2) β ∈ (-1, 1)\\n3) f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx\\n\\nProve that f(α, β) = f(β, α).\\n\\n**Proof:**\\n\\n**Theorem:** For α, β ∈ (-1, 1), if f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx, then f(α, β) = f(β, α).\\n\\n**Proof:**\\nThe proof strategy is to find a closed-form expression for f(α, β) using contour integration and then demonstrate that the resulting expression is symmetric with respect to α and β.\\n\\n**1. Contour Integration Setup**\\nWe define a complex function g(z) = z^α / (1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) and use a keyhole contour C around the positive real axis, which serves as the branch cut for z^α. The poles of g(z) are the roots of the denominator, z² + 2z cos(πβ) + 1 = 0. These are simple poles located at z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} and z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}. For α, β ∈ (-1, 1), both poles lie inside the contour.\\n\\n**2. Residue Calculation**\\nBy the Residue Theorem, the contour integral is ∮_C g(z) dz = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]. The sum of the residues is calculated as:\\nSum = [e^{iπα(1-β)} - e^{iπα(1+β)}] / (2i sin(πβ)) = -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ)\\n\\n**3. Contour Integral Evaluation**\\nThe integrals over the circular parts of the contour vanish as their radii tend to ∞ and 0, respectively, given that α ∈ (-1, 1). The integrals along the real axis, above and below the branch cut, combine to yield:\\n∮_C g(z) dz = (1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β)\\n\\n**4. Derivation of the Closed Form**\\nEquating the two expressions for the contour integral gives:\\n(1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β) = 2πi * [ -e^{iπα} sin(παβ) / sin(πβ) ]\\nUsing the identity 1 - e^{2πiα} = -e^{iπα}(2i sin(πα)), we solve for f(α, β):\\nf(α, β) = π * sin(παβ) / (sin(πα) sin(πβ))\\n\\n**5. Conclusion**\\nThe derived closed-form expression, f(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) / [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)], is manifestly symmetric in α and β because both the numerator and the denominator are symmetric with respect to the interchange of α and β.\\n\\nTherefore, we have proven that **f(α, β) = f(β, α)**. ∎\"\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n\"proof_review\": true,\n\"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:** Prove that ℝ as a vector space over ℚ is infinite-dimensional.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe will prove this by contradiction.\n\n1.  **Assume for contradiction that ℝ is finite-dimensional over ℚ.**\n    Suppose ℝ is a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of rational numbers, ℚ. Let its dimension be `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. This implies that there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ. By the definition of a basis, every real number `x` can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors with coefficients in ℚ:\n    x = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ, where q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ ∈ ℚ.\n\n2.  **Establish a bijection between ℝ and ℚⁿ.**\n    The unique representation of each `x` ∈ ℝ as a linear combination of the basis vectors defines a mapping φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ given by:\n    φ(x) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ).\n    This mapping is a vector space isomorphism, and therefore it is a bijection. A bijection between two sets implies that they have the same cardinality. Thus, |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of ℚⁿ.**\n    The set of rational numbers, ℚ, is countable. A fundamental result in set theory states that the finite Cartesian product of countable sets is itself countable. Since ℚⁿ is the product of `n` copies of ℚ, ℚⁿ is a countable set. This means its cardinality is equal to that of the natural numbers, |ℚⁿ| = |ℕ| = ℵ₀.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality of ℝ.**\n    It is a well-established theorem, originally proven by Georg Cantor, that the set of real numbers, ℝ, is uncountable. This means that there is no bijection between ℝ and ℕ, and its cardinality is strictly greater than that of the natural numbers: |ℝ| > ℵ₀.\n\n5.  **Derive the contradiction.**\n    From our steps above, we have concluded:\n    - From the assumption of finite-dimensionality: |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n    - From the countability of ℚⁿ: |ℚⁿ| = ℵ₀.\n    - From the uncountability of ℝ: |ℝ| > ℵ₀.\n\n    Combining these results, we get |ℝ| = ℵ₀ and |ℝ| > ℵ₀. This is a contradiction, as a number cannot be equal to and strictly greater than itself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Our initial assumption that ℝ is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℚ must be false. Therefore, ℝ is an infinite-dimensional vector space over ℚ.\n\nfinal:"
