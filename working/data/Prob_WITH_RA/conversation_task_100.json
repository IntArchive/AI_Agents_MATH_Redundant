We need to show that g = e.\n\nSince the action is properly discontinuous, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that for any h ∈ G, if hU ∩ U ≠ ∅, then h = e.\n\nNow consider the element g. Since gx = x, we have x ∈ U (as U is a neighborhood of x) and also x = gx ∈ gU. Therefore, x ∈ U ∩ gU, which implies U ∩ gU ≠ ∅.\n\nBy the property of proper discontinuity applied to U, we conclude that g = e. This proves the action is free.\n\n**Part 2: Proving ρ is proper**\n\nLet K ⊂ X × X be compact. We need to show that ρ⁻¹(K) is compact in G × X.\n\n**Step 1: Projections of K**\nLet π₁, π₂: X × X → X be the projection maps onto the first and second coordinates respectively. Define:\nK₁ = π₁(K) = {x ∈ X : ∃y ∈ X such that (x,y) ∈ K}\nK₂ = π₂(K) = {y ∈ X : ∃x ∈ X such that (x,y) ∈ K}\nSince π₁ and π₂ are continuous and K is compact, both K₁ and K₂ are compact subsets of X.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing ρ⁻¹(K)**\nWe have:\nρ⁻¹(K) = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : ρ(g,x) ∈ K} = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : (x,gx) ∈ K}\nThis can be rewritten as:\nρ⁻¹(K) = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : x ∈ K₁ and gx ∈ K₂}\n\n**Step 3: Finding a compact neighborhood of K₁**\nSince X is locally compact and K₁ is compact, we can find a compact set C which is a neighborhood of K₁. For each x ∈ K₁, there exists an open neighborhood Oₓ with compact closure Cₓ. Since K₁ is compact, it can be covered by a finite number of these open sets, say Oₓ₁, ..., Oₓₙ. The union of the corresponding closures, C = ⋃ᵢ Cₓᵢ, is a compact set containing K₁.\n\n**Step 4: Showing the g-coordinate is finite**\nConsider any (g,x) ∈ ρ⁻¹(K). Then x ∈ K₁ ⊂ C and gx ∈ K₂. This implies that gC ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅.\n\nLet S = {g ∈ G : gC ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅}. We claim this set is finite.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that S is infinite. Let {gₙ} be an infinite sequence of distinct elements in S. For each n, we can choose xₙ ∈ C and yₙ ∈ K₂ such that yₙ = gₙxₙ.\nSince C and K₂ are compact, there exist convergent subsequences. By passing to such a subsequence (which we relabel), we have xₙ → x ∈ C and yₙ → y ∈ K₂.\nFrom yₙ = gₙxₙ, we have gₙxₙ → y.\nLet U be a neighborhood of x such that {h ∈ G : hU ∩ U ≠ ∅} = {e}. Since xₙ → x, for n sufficiently large, xₙ ∈ U.\nConsider two distinct large indices n and m. We have gₙxₙ → y and gₘxₘ → y. This implies gₘ⁻¹(gₙxₙ) → xₘ. As xₘ → x, we have gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ → x.\nSince xₙ ∈ U and gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ gets arbitrarily close to x, for large enough n and m, both xₙ and gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ lie in U. This means (gₘ⁻¹gₙ)U ∩ U ≠ ∅.\nBy the property of U, this implies gₘ⁻¹gₙ = e, so gₘ = gₙ. This contradicts our assumption that the elements of the sequence are distinct.\nThus, S must be a finite set. Let S = {g₁, g₂, ..., gₘ}.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the x-coordinate for each g**\nFor each fixed gⱼ ∈ S, consider the set of x such that (gⱼ, x) ∈ ρ⁻¹(K). This requires:\nx ∈ K₁ and gⱼx ∈ K₂, which is equivalent to x ∈ K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂.\n\nNow, K₁ is compact (as shown in Step 1). The map x ↦ gⱼ⁻¹x is a homeomorphism, so gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact because K₂ is compact. In a Hausdorff space, the intersection of two compact sets is compact, so K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact.\n\n**Step 6: Concluding compactness of ρ⁻¹(K)**\nWe can now express ρ⁻¹(K) as:\nρ⁻¹(K) = ⋃_{j=1}^m {gⱼ} × (K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂)\n\nThis is a finite union of sets of the form {gⱼ} × Cⱼ, where each Cⱼ = K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact. Since G has the discrete topology, each singleton {gⱼ} is compact. The product of two compact sets is compact. Therefore, each {gⱼ} × Cⱼ is compact.\n\nA finite union of compact sets is compact, so ρ⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any compact K ⊂ X × X, the preimage ρ⁻¹(K) is compact in G × X. Therefore, ρ is proper. Combined with Part 1 showing the action is free, the proof is complete.\n\nfinal:The proof is correct."

Assume the action is properly discontinuous, meaning that for every x ∈ X, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that if gU ∩ U ≠ ∅ for some g ∈ G, then g = e (the identity element). Prove that:\n1. The action is free (i.e., if gx = x for some x ∈ X, then g = e).\n2. The map ρ: G × X → X × X defined by ρ(g,x) = (x,gx) is proper (i.e., the preimage of every compact subset of X × X is compact in G × X).\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe prove both statements separately.\n\n**Part 1: Proving the action is free**\n\nLet g ∈ G and x ∈ X such that gx = x. We need to show that g = e.\n\nSince the action is properly discontinuous, there exists a neighborhood U of x such that for any h ∈ G, if hU ∩ U ≠ ∅, then h = e.\n\nNow consider the element g. Since gx = x, we have x ∈ U (as U is a neighborhood of x) and also x = gx ∈ gU. Therefore, x ∈ U ∩ gU, which implies U ∩ gU ≠ ∅.\n\nBy the property of proper discontinuity applied to U, we conclude that g = e. This proves the action is free.\n\n**Part 2: Proving ρ is proper**\n\nLet K ⊂ X × X be compact. We need to show that ρ⁻¹(K) is compact in G × X.\n\n**Step 1: Projections of K**\nLet π₁, π₂: X × X → X be the projection maps onto the first and second coordinates respectively. Define:\nK₁ = π₁(K) = {x ∈ X : ∃y ∈ X such that (x,y) ∈ K}\nK₂ = π₂(K) = {y ∈ X : ∃x ∈ X such that (x,y) ∈ K}\nSince π₁ and π₂ are continuous and K is compact, both K₁ and K₂ are compact subsets of X.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing ρ⁻¹(K)**\nWe have:\nρ⁻¹(K) = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : ρ(g,x) ∈ K} = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : (x,gx) ∈ K}\nThis can be rewritten as:\nρ⁻¹(K) = {(g,x) ∈ G × X : x ∈ K₁ and gx ∈ K₂}\n\n**Step 3: Finding a compact neighborhood of K₁**\nSince X is locally compact and K₁ is compact, we can find a compact set C which is a neighborhood of K₁. For each x ∈ K₁, there exists an open neighborhood Oₓ with compact closure Cₓ. Since K₁ is compact, it can be covered by a finite number of these open sets, say Oₓ₁, ..., Oₓₙ. The union of the corresponding closures, C = ⋃ᵢ Cₓᵢ, is a compact set containing K₁.\n\n**Step 4: Showing the g-coordinate is finite**\nConsider any (g,x) ∈ ρ⁻¹(K). Then x ∈ K₁ ⊂ C and gx ∈ K₂. This implies that gC ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅.\n\nLet S = {g ∈ G : gC ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅}. We claim this set is finite.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that S is infinite. Let {gₙ} be an infinite sequence of distinct elements in S. For each n, we can choose xₙ ∈ C and yₙ ∈ K₂ such that yₙ = gₙxₙ.\nSince C and K₂ are compact, there exist convergent subsequences. By passing to such a subsequence (which we relabel), we have xₙ → x ∈ C and yₙ → y ∈ K₂.\nFrom yₙ = gₙxₙ, we have gₙxₙ → y.\nLet U be a neighborhood of x such that {h ∈ G : hU ∩ U ≠ ∅} = {e}. Since xₙ → x, for n sufficiently large, xₙ ∈ U.\nConsider two distinct large indices n and m. We have gₙxₙ → y and gₘxₘ → y. This implies gₘ⁻¹(gₙxₙ) → xₘ. As xₘ → x, we have gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ → x.\nSince xₙ ∈ U and gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ gets arbitrarily close to x, for large enough n and m, both xₙ and gₘ⁻¹gₙxₙ lie in U. This means (gₘ⁻¹gₙ)U ∩ U ≠ ∅.\nBy the property of U, this implies gₘ⁻¹gₙ = e, so gₘ = gₙ. This contradicts our assumption that the elements of the sequence are distinct.\nThus, S must be a finite set. Let S = {g₁, g₂, ..., gₘ}.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the x-coordinate for each g**\nFor each fixed gⱼ ∈ S, consider the set of x such that (gⱼ, x) ∈ ρ⁻¹(K). This requires:\nx ∈ K₁ and gⱼx ∈ K₂, which is equivalent to x ∈ K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂.\n\nNow, K₁ is compact (as shown in Step 1). The map x ↦ gⱼ⁻¹x is a homeomorphism, so gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact because K₂ is compact. In a Hausdorff space, the intersection of two compact sets is compact, so K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact.\n\n**Step 6: Concluding compactness of ρ⁻¹(K)**\nWe can now express ρ⁻¹(K) as:\nρ⁻¹(K) = ⋃_{j=1}^m {gⱼ} × (K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂)\n\nThis is a finite union of sets of the form {gⱼ} × Cⱼ, where each Cⱼ = K₁ ∩ gⱼ⁻¹K₂ is compact. Since G has the discrete topology, each singleton {gⱼ} is compact. The product of two compact sets is compact. Therefore, each {gⱼ} × Cⱼ is compact.\n\nA finite union of compact sets is compact, so ρ⁻¹(K) is compact.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any compact K ⊂ X × X, the preimage ρ⁻¹(K) is compact in G × X. Therefore, ρ is proper. Combined with Part 1 showing the action is free, the proof is complete.\n\nfinal:The proof is correct."

Since U = ⋃_{i=1}^n U_{x_i}, if gU ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅, then there exists some i such that gU_{x_i} ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅. But K₂ is compact, and there are only finitely many g that can move U_{x_i} to intersect any given compact set (this follows from proper discontinuity and the fact that we can cover K₂ with finitely many neighborhoods with the finite intersection property). More formally, we can argue: For each i, the set {g ∈ G : gU_{x_i} ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅} is finite because otherwise we could find infinitely many distinct g_j with g_jU_{x_i} ∩ K₂ ≠ ∅, and by compactness of K₂, this would contradict proper discontinuity.\n\nThus S = {g₁, g₂, ..., g_m} is a finite set.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the x-coordinate for each g**\nFor each fixed g_j ∈ S, consider the set of x such that (g_j, x) ∈ ρ⁻¹(K).
