    "Content":"Continuing my work through Dummit & Foote's \"Abstract Algebra\", 3.1.36 asks the following (which is exactly the same as exercise 5 in this related MSE answer ): Prove that if $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian. [If $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic with generator $xZ(G)$, show that every element of $G$ can be written in the form $x^az$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and some element $z \\in Z(G)$] The hint is actually the hardest part for me, as the quotient groups are somewhat abstract. But once I have the hint, I can write: $g, h \\in G$ implies that $g = x^{a_1}z_1$ and $h = x^{a_2}z_2$, so\n\\begin{align*}gh &= (x^{a_1}z_1)(x^{a_2}z_2)\\\\\\\n &= x^{a_1}x^{a_2}z_1z_2\\\\\\\n& = x^{a_1 + a_2}z_2z_1\\\\\\\n&= \\ldots = (x^{a_2}z_2)(x^{a_1}z_1) = hg.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, $G$ is abelian. 1) Is this right so far? 2) How can I prove the \"hint\"?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"We have that $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic, and so there is an element $x\\in G$ such that $G\/Z(G)=\\langle xZ(G)\\rangle$ , where $xZ(G)$ is the coset with representative $x$ . Now let $g\\in G$ . We know that $gZ(G)=(xZ(G))^m$ for some $m$ , and by definition $(xZ(G))^m=x^mZ(G)$ . Now, in general, if $H\\leq G$ , we have by definition too that $aH=bH$ if and only if $b^{-1}a\\in H$ . In our case, we have that $gZ(G)=x^mZ(G)$ , and this happens if and only if $(x^m)^{-1}g\\in Z(G)$ . Then, there's a $z\\in Z(G)$ such that $(x^{m})^{-1}g=z$ , and so $g=x^mz$ . The hint is then proved, and the rest is identical to the work you did.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so the user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. Let me start by carefully reading the original question and understanding its components.\n\nThe title of the question is \"If $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.\" The user is working through Dummit & Foote's exercise and has a proof attempt. They are asking if their proof is correct and how to prove the hint provided in the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions and the core problem from the original question. The main problem is to prove that if the quotient group $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian. The user also mentions a hint about showing every element of $G$ can be written as $x^a z$ where $xZ(G)$ generates $G\/Z(G)$ and $z \\in Z(G)$. \n\nNow, the task is to structure this into the given format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. The problem statement is the main thing to prove.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the assumptions were about the properties of $n$. In this case, the key assumption is that $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Since $G$ is a group and $Z(G)$ is its center, the only assumption here is about the structure of the quotient group. There's no mention of any other conditions like $G$ being finite or specific elements, so I don't need to add extra assumptions. The problem is to prove $G$ is abelian given that $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic.\n\nI need to make sure that the assumptions are listed correctly. Each assumption should be a single property. Here, the quotient group being cyclic is one condition. The problem is the statement to prove. The user's own steps and questions about the hint are part of their thought process but not part of the structured problem. The formatted problem should only include the given conditions and the goal.\n\nSo the assumption is that $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. The problem is to prove that $G$ is abelian. The rest of the user's content is their attempt and questions, which are not part of the problem structure. Therefore, the formatted problem should have that single assumption and the problem statement.",

    "judge":"Answer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nAssumption: $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Problem: Prove that $G$ is abelian.\nSolution_for_new_problem:\nLet $G\/Z(G)$ be cyclic. Then there exists $xZ(G) \\in G\/Z(G)$ such that $G\/Z(G) = \\langle xZ(G) \\rangle$. For any $g \\in G$, the coset $gZ(G)$ can be written as $(xZ(G))^m = x^mZ(G)$ for some integer $m$. Thus $g = x^m z$ for some $z \\in Z(G)$. Now take any two elements $g_1, g_2 \\in G$. Write $g_1 = x^{m_1} z_1$ and $g_2 = x^{m_2} z_2$ where $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$. Then: $g_1g_2 = x^{m_1}z_1 x^{m_2}z_2 = x^{m_1}x^{m_2}z_1z_2 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$ and $g_2g_1 = x^{m_2}z_2 x^{m_1}z_1 = x^{m_2}x^{m_1}z_2z_1 = x^{m_2+m_1}z_2z_1 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$. Since $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$, they commute with all elements, and $x^{m_1}x^{m_2} = x^{m_2}x^{m_1} = x^{m_1+m_2}$. Therefore $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$, so $G$ is abelian.\n",

Prove that $G$ is abelian.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe are given that $G$ is a group and $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. We need to prove that $G$ is abelian, i.e., for all $g_1, g_2 \\in G$, we have $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$.\n\nLet $Z(G)$ be the center of $G$. Since $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic, there exists an element $x \\in G$ such that the coset $xZ(G)$ generates $G\/Z(G)$. This means that any element of $G\/Z(G)$ can be written as $(xZ(G))^m = x^mZ(G)$ for some integer $m$.\n\nLet $g_1$ and $g_2$ be two arbitrary elements of $G$. Their corresponding cosets in $G\/Z(G)$ are $g_1Z(G)$ and $g_2Z(G)$. Since $xZ(G)$ generates $G\/Z(G)$, there exist integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that:\n$g_1Z(G) = (xZ(G))^{m_1} = x^{m_1}Z(G)$\n$g_2Z(G) = (xZ(G))^{m_2} = x^{m_2}Z(G)$\n\nFrom the definition of cosets, $g_1 \\in x^{m_1}Z(G)$ and $g_2 \\in x^{m_2}Z(G)$. This implies that there exist elements $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$ such that:\n$g_1 = x^{m_1}z_1$\n$g_2 = x^{m_2}z_2$\n\nNow, let's compute the product $g_1g_2$:\n$g_1g_2 = (x^{m_1}z_1)(x^{m_2}z_2)$\nUsing associativity, we can write:\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1}(z_1x^{m_2})z_2$\nSince $z_1 \\in Z(G)$, it commutes with every element of $G$, including $x^{m_2}$. Therefore, $z_1x^{m_2} = x^{m_2}z_1$.\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1}(x^{m_2}z_1)z_2$\nBy associativity and the law of exponents:\n$g_1g_2 = (x^{m_1}x^{m_2})(z_1z_2) = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$\n\nNext, let's compute the product $g_2g_1$:\n$g_2g_1 = (x^{m_2}z_2)(x^{m_1}z_1)$\nUsing associativity:\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_2}(z_2x^{m_1})z_1$\nSince $z_2 \\in Z(G)$, it commutes with $x^{m_1}$, so $z_2x^{m_1} = x^{m_1}z_2$.\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_2}(x^{m_1}z_2)z_1$\nBy associativity and the law of exponents:\n$g_2g_1 = (x^{m_2}x^{m_1})(z_2z_1) = x^{m_2+m_1}z_2z_1$\n\nSince addition of integers is commutative, $m_1+m_2 = m_2+m_1$. Also, since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are both in the center $Z(G)$, they commute with all elements of $G$, and in particular, they commute with each other, so $z_1z_2 = z_2z_1$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$\n\nComparing the expressions for $g_1g_2$ and $g_2g_1$, we see that:\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2 = g_2g_1$\n\nSince $g_1$ and $g_2$ were arbitrary elements of $G$, we have shown that $G$ is abelian. ∎\n\nfinal:\n**Problem:** Let $G$ be a group such that the quotient group $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Prove that $G$ is abelian.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $Z(G)$ be the center of $G$. We are given that the quotient group $G\/Z(G)$ is cyclic. This means there exists an element $x \\in G$ such that the coset $xZ(G)$ is a generator for $G\/Z(G)$.\nTherefore, for any element $g \\in G$, its coset $gZ(G)$ can be expressed as a power of the generator:\n$gZ(G) = (xZ(G))^m = x^mZ(G)$ for some integer $m$.\n\nThis equality of cosets implies that $g \\in x^mZ(G)$, which means $g$ can be written in the form $g = x^m z$ for some element $z \\in Z(G)$.\n\nNow, let $g_1$ and $g_2$ be any two arbitrary elements in $G$. Based on the above, we can write them as:\n$g_1 = x^{m_1} z_1$\n$g_2 = x^{m_2} z_2$\nfor some integers $m_1, m_2$ and some elements $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$.\n\nLet's compute the product $g_1g_2$:\n$g_1g_2 = (x^{m_1} z_1)(x^{m_2} z_2)$\nSince $z_1$ is in the center of $G$, it commutes with all elements of $G$, including $x^{m_2}$. Thus, $z_1x^{m_2} = x^{m_2}z_1$.\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1} (z_1 x^{m_2}) z_2 = x^{m_1} (x^{m_2} z_1) z_2 = (x^{m_1} x^{m_2}) (z_1 z_2) = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$.\n\nNow, let's compute the product $g_2g_1$:\n$g_2g_1 = (x^{m_2} z_2)(x^{m_1} z_1)$\nSince $z_2 \\in Z(G)$, it commutes with $x^{m_1}$, so $z_2x^{m_1} = x^{m_1}z_2$.\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_2} (z_2 x^{m_1}) z_1 = x^{m_2} (x^{m_1} z_2) z_1 = (x^{m_2} x^{m_1}) (z_2 z_1) = x^{m_2+m_1} z_2 z_1$.\n\nWe know that integer addition is commutative, so $m_1+m_2 = m_2+m_1$. Also, since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are both in the center $Z(G)$, they commute with all elements of $G$, which means they commute with each other ($z_1z_2 = z_2z_1$).\nTherefore, we have:\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$\n\nThis shows that $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$. Since $g_1$ and $g_2$ were arbitrary elements of $G$, the group $G$ is abelian. ∎"
