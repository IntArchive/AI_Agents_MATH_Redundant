    "Content":"If $n>1$ is an integer, then $\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^n \\frac1k$ is not an integer. If you know Bertrand's Postulate , then you know there must be a prime $p$ between $n\/2$ and $n$, so $\\frac 1p$ appears in the sum, but $\\frac{1}{2p}$ does not. Aside from $\\frac 1p$, every other term $\\frac 1k$ has $k$ divisible only by primes smaller than $p$. We can combine all those terms to get $\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac 1k = \\frac 1p + \\frac ab$, where $b$ is not divisible by $p$. If this were an integer, then (multiplying by $b$) $\\frac bp +a$ would also be an integer, which it isn't since $b$ isn't divisible by $p$. Does anybody know an elementary proof of this which doesn't rely on Bertrand's Postulate? For a while, I was convinced I'd seen one, but now I'm starting to suspect whatever argument I saw was wrong.",

The argument is more naturally expressed using valuation theory, but I purposely avoided that because Anton requested an \"elementary\" solution. The above proof can easily be made comprehensible to a high-school student. Generally we can similarly prove that a sum of fractions is nonintegral if the highest power of  a prime $\\,p\\,$ in any denominator occurs in $\\rm\\color{darkorange}{exactly\\ one}$ denominator, e.g. see the Remark here where I explain how it occurs in a trickier multiplicative form (from a contest problem). In valuation theory, this is a special case of a basic result on the valuation of a sum (sometimes called the \"dominance lemma\" or similar).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question is about proving that the harmonic series sum from k=1 to n of 1\/k is never an integer when n>1. The user mentions Bertrand's Postulate but asks for an elementary proof without it. \n\nLooking at the problem statement, the key assumptions are:\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n is greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum is not an integer. The example given in the original question includes assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So following that structure, here the assumptions should be n is an integer and n>1. I need to list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property for one object. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"If n>1 is an integer\", so the two conditions are n is an integer and n>1. These are separate assumptions. The problem is to show the sum isn't an integer. So in the formatted version, the assumptions are n is an integer and n > 1. Then the problem statement is the sum from k=1 to n of 1\/k is never an integer. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user is asking for a proof that doesn't rely on Bertrand's Postulate, but that's part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. The formatted problem should only include the conditions given for the problem itself, not the method of proof. So the answer should list the two assumptions and then the problem statement as given.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumptions:\nAssumption 1: $n$ is an integer\nAssumption 2: $n > 1$\nProblem:\nProve that $\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}$ is never an integer.\nLet n be an integer greater than 1, and define the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k.\n\n**Step 1: Define key quantities**\nLet m be the largest integer such that 2^m ≤ n. Equivalently, m = ⌊log₂(n)⌋, so we have 2^m ≤ n < 2^{m+1}.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the common denominator**\nLet L = lcm(1, 2, ..., n) be the least common multiple of all integers from 1 to n. Write H_n with denominator L:\nH_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k = (∑_{k=1}^n L\/k)\/L = N\/L,\nwhere N = ∑_{k=1}^n L\/k.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2-adic valuation of L**\nThe 2-adic valuation v₂(L) (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of L) is exactly m. This is because:\n- 2^m ≤ n, so 2^m appears as a factor in one of the numbers 1,2,...,n\n- 2^{m+1} > n, so no multiple of 2^{m+1} appears in 1,2,...,n\n- Therefore, the highest power of 2 dividing any number in {1,2,...,n} is 2^m\n- Since L is the lcm, it must contain exactly 2^m as a factor, but not 2^{m+1}\n\nThus, L = 2^m × M, where M is odd.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity of terms L\/k**\nFor each term L\/k in the numerator N:\n\nCase 1: When k = 2^m\nL\/2^m = M, which is odd.\n\nCase 2: When k ≠ 2^m\nLet v₂(k) be the exponent of 2 in k's prime factorization. Since k ≤ n < 2^{m+1}, we have v₂(k) ≤ m. But since k ≠ 2^m, we actually have v₂(k) ≤ m-1 (because if v₂(k) = m, then k would be a multiple of 2^m, and the only such number ≤ n that is exactly 2^m is 2^m itself).\n\nTherefore, v₂(L\/k) = v₂(L) - v₂(k) = m - v₂(k) ≥ m - (m-1) = 1.\nThis means L\/k contains at least one factor of 2, so L\/k is even.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the parity of N**\nN = ∑_{k=1}^n L\/k consists of:\n- Exactly one odd term: when k = 2^m\n- All other (n-1) terms are even\n\nThe sum of one odd number and any number of even numbers is odd. Therefore, N is odd.\n\n**Step 6: Show H_n cannot be an integer**\nWe have H_n = N\/L, where:\n- N is odd (from Step 5)\n- L is even (since L contains factor 2^m with m ≥ 1 for n > 1)\n\nIf H_n were an integer, say H_n = K where K is an integer, then we would have N = K × L.\nBut the left side N is odd, while the right side K × L is even (since L is even).\nThis is a contradiction because an odd number cannot equal an even number.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nTherefore, for any integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k cannot be an integer.\n\n**Remark:** The proof crucially uses the fact that for n > 1, there exists a unique maximum power of 2 not exceeding n, and this creates exactly one term with odd numerator when expressing H_n with common denominator L = lcm(1,2,...,n).",
    "final reviewer":"```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": true,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:** Prove that for integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k is never an integer.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet n be an integer greater than 1, and define the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k.\n\n**Step 1: Define key quantities**\nLet m be the largest integer such that 2^m ≤ n. This means 2^m ≤ n < 2^{m+1}. Since n > 1, we have m ≥ 1.\n\n**Step 2: Express the sum with a common denominator**\nLet L = lcm(1, 2, ..., n) be the least common multiple of all integers from 1 to n. We can write H_n as a fraction with denominator L:\nH_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k = (∑_{k=1}^n L\/k) \/ L = N\/L,\nwhere N = ∑_{k=1}^n L\/k. To prove H_n is not an integer, we will show that L does not divide N.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the prime factorization of L**\nThe exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of L (the 2-adic valuation, v₂(L)) is exactly m. This is because the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n is 2^m. Therefore, L can be written as L = 2^m × M, where M is an odd integer. Since m ≥ 1, L is an even number.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity of the terms in the numerator N**\nWe examine the parity of each term L\/k in the sum N = ∑_{k=1}^n L\/k.\n\n*   **Case 1: k = 2^m**\n    The term is L\/k = L\/2^m = (2^m × M) \/ 2^m = M. Since M is odd, this term is odd. By the definition of m, 2^m is the only multiple of 2^m in the range [1, n] (as 2 * 2^m = 2^{m+1} > n). Thus, this is the only term of this form.\n\n*   **Case 2: k ≠ 2^m**\n    For any other integer k in {1, 2, ..., n}, let v₂(k) be the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization. Since k is not the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n, we must have v₂(k) < m.\n    The 2-adic valuation of the term L\/k is v₂(L\/k) = v₂(L) - v₂(k) = m - v₂(k).\n    Since v₂(k) < m, we have m - v₂(k) ≥ 1. This implies that L\/k contains at least one factor of 2, meaning L\/k is an even number.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the parity of N**\nThe numerator N is the sum of all terms L\/k for k from 1 to n.\nN = (L\/1 + L\/2 + ... + L\/n)\nThis sum consists of exactly one odd term (when k = 2^m) and n-1 even terms. The sum of one odd number and any quantity of even numbers is always odd. Therefore, N is an odd integer.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude that H_n cannot be an integer**\nWe have expressed the harmonic sum as H_n = N\/L.\n- The numerator N is an odd integer.\n- The denominator L is an even integer.\n\nAn odd integer cannot be divided by an even integer to produce an integer result. If H_n were an integer K, we would have N = K × L. This would mean an odd number (N) is equal to an even number (K × L), which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, H_n cannot be an integer.\n\nfinal: For any integer n > 1, the harmonic sum H_n = ∑_{k=1}^n 1\/k is never an integer."
