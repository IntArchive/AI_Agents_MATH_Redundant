This definition is natural since lim_{x→0} (sin x/x)² = 1. The function f is even, continuous on ℝ, and decays like 1/x² as |x| → ∞, ensuring good integrability properties.\n\n**Step 2: Express the given sum in terms of f**\nFrom assumption (2), we have:\n∑_{n=1}^∞ f(n) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (sin n/n)² = π/2 - 1/2.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Poisson summation formula**\nThe Poisson summation formula states that for a sufficiently nice function f (specifically, f and its Fourier transform should be in L¹ and satisfy certain decay conditions, which f satisfies due to its 1/x² decay), we have:\n∑_{n=-∞}^∞ f(n) = ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ ẑf(2πk),\nwhere ẑf(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)e^{-iωx}dx is the Fourier transform of f.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the left-hand side**\nSince f is even, f(-n) = f(n) for n > 0, and f(0) = 1.

This is a known result:\nẑf(ω) = π(1 - |ω|/2) for |ω| ≤ 2, and ẑf(ω) = 0 for |ω| > 2.\n\nTo verify this, note that (sin x/x)² = (1 - cos 2x)/(2x²). The Fourier transform can be computed using convolution properties: since sin x/x has Fourier transform π·χ_{[-1,1]}(ω) (where χ is the characteristic function), squaring in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain, yielding the triangular function above.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the right-hand side of Poisson summation**\nWe need ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ ẑf(2πk). For k ≠ 0, |2πk| ≥ 2π > 2 (since π > 1), so ẑf(2πk) = 0.

The existence of the improper Riemann integral ∫₀^∞ (sin x/x)² dx is given, which justifies the Fourier transform computation.\n2. The given sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ (sin n/n)² = π/2 - 1/2 is used in Step 4.\n3. The function f satisfies the conditions for Poisson summation: f ∈ L¹(ℝ) since ∫_{-∞}^∞ |f(x)|dx = 2∫₀^∞ (sin x/x)² dx exists, and f has sufficient decay for the formula to hold.\n\nThus we have proven that ∫₀^∞ (sin x/x)² dx = π/2.",
