Let $h: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^m$ be a homeomorphism.\\n\\nConsider the inclusion map $\\\\iota: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^m$ defined by $\\\\iota(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) = (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, 0, \\\\ldots, 0)$.

Dimension of $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$\\n\\n**Theorem 4.1:** $\\\\dim(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$.\\n\\n*Proof:* We proceed by contradiction.

Alternative Direct Proof Using Lebesgue Covering Dimension\\n\\nFor completeness, we also provide a direct proof using the definition of Lebesgue covering dimension.\\n\\n**Definition:** The Lebesgue covering dimension $\\\\dim(X)$ of a topological space $X$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that every open cover of $X$ has an open refinement of order at most $n+1$ (i.e., every point lies in at most $n+1$ sets of the refinement).\\n\\n**Theorem 5.1:** $\\\\dim(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$.\\n\\n*Proof sketch (direct approach):*\\n\\n1. **Upper bound ($\\\\dim(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) \\\\leq n$):** Any open cover of $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be refined to a locally finite cover by convex sets (e.g., by cubes). Such a cover can be further refined to have order at most $n+1$ using barycentric subdivision or nerve constructions. This shows $\\\\dim(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) \\\\leq n$.\\n\\n2. **Lower bound ($\\\\dim(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) \\\\geq n$):** Construct an open cover of $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ that cannot be refined to have order less than $n+1$. For example, consider the cover of $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$ by the $n+1$ open sets:\\n   $$U_i = \\\\{(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n : x_i > -1\\\\} \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i=1,\\\\ldots,n$$\\n   $$U_{n+1} = \\\\{(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < 1\\\\}$$\\n   Any refinement of this cover must have order at least $n+1$ because the point $(0,0,\\\\ldots,0)$ is contained in all $n+1$ sets, and this property persists under refinement.

The proof proceeds in two main steps. First, we establish that Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic. Second, we use this fact to show that the dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be $n$.\n\n## 1. Non-Homeomorphism of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^m$\n\nThis part of the proof relies on the Invariance of Domain theorem.\n\n**Theorem 1 (Invariance of Domain, Brouwer):** Let $U$ be an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^k$ and let $f: U \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ be an injective, continuous map. Then $f(U)$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\n**Lemma:** For positive integers $n \\neq m$, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\n*Proof of Lemma:*\nAssume for contradiction that there exists a homeomorphism $h: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$ with $n \\neq m$. Without loss of generality, let $n < m$.\n\nSince $h$ is a homeomorphism, its inverse $h^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is also a continuous map.\n\nLet $\\iota: \\mathbb{R}^n \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$ be the standard inclusion map, defined by $\\iota(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. The map $\\iota$ is continuous and injective.\n\nNow, consider the composite map $f = \\iota \\circ h^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n-   As the composition of continuous maps, $f$ is continuous.\n-   As the composition of injective maps, $f$ is injective.\n\nThe domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}^m$, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. We can therefore apply the Invariance of Domain theorem to $f$ (with $k=m$). The theorem implies that the image $f(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ must be an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\nLet's examine the image of $f$:\n$$f(\\mathbb{R}^m) = \\iota(h^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\iota(\\mathbb{R}^n)$$\nThe image $\\iota(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ whose last $m-n$ coordinates are zero. This is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ because $n < m$. A proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ has an empty interior and is therefore not an open set.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: $f(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ must be open by the Invariance of Domain theorem, but it is not open because it is a proper subspace. Thus, our initial assumption that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ must be false. $\\square$\n\n## 2. The Dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n\nThe second part of the proof uses two major results from dimension theory and topology:\n1.  For any $k$-dimensional topological manifold $M$, its Lebesgue covering dimension is equal to its manifold dimension, i.e., $\\dim(M) = k$.\n2.  A contractible $k$-dimensional manifold that is simply connected at infinity is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$. (This follows from work by Stallings, Smale, and Freedman, which generalizes the Poincaré conjecture).\n\n**Theorem 2:** $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$.\n\n*Proof of Theorem:*\nAssume for contradiction that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = k$ for some integer $k \\neq n$.\n\nBy the first result cited above, if the Lebesgue covering dimension of the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $k$, then it must be a $k$-dimensional manifold. This means that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nFurthermore, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a contractible space. For $n \\ge 2$, it is also simply connected at infinity. (The cases $n=1,2$ are also consistent with the conclusion). By the second major result cited above, these properties imply that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be globally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nHowever, we proved in the Lemma that if $k \\neq n$, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\neq n$ must be false.

Without loss of generality, let $n < m$.\n\nSince $h$ is a homeomorphism, its inverse $h^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is also a continuous map.\n\nLet $\\iota: \\mathbb{R}^n \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$ be the standard inclusion map, defined by $\\iota(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n, 0, \\ldots, 0)$. The map $\\iota$ is continuous and injective.\n\nNow, consider the composite map $f = \\iota \\circ h^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n-   As the composition of continuous maps, $f$ is continuous.\n-   As the composition of injective maps, $f$ is injective.\n\nThe domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}^m$, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. We can therefore apply the Invariance of Domain theorem to $f$ (with $k=m$).

This is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ because $n < m$. A proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ has an empty interior and is therefore not an open set.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: $f(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ must be open by the Invariance of Domain theorem, but it is not open because it is a proper subspace. Thus, our initial assumption that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ must be false. $\\square$\n\n## 2.

For any $k$-dimensional topological manifold $M$, its Lebesgue covering dimension is equal to its manifold dimension, i.e., $\\dim(M) = k$.\n2.  A contractible $k$-dimensional manifold that is simply connected at infinity is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$. (This follows from work by Stallings, Smale, and Freedman, which generalizes the Poincaré conjecture).\n\n**Theorem 2:** $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$.\n\n*Proof of Theorem:*\nAssume for contradiction that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = k$ for some integer $k \\neq n$.\n\nBy the first result cited above, if the Lebesgue covering dimension of the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $k$, then it must be a $k$-dimensional manifold. This means that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nFurthermore, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a contractible space. For $n \\ge 2$, it is also simply connected at infinity. (The cases $n=1,2$ are also consistent with the conclusion). By the second major result cited above, these properties imply that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be globally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nHowever, we proved in the Lemma that if $k \\neq n$, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.

The map $\\iota$ is continuous and injective.\n\nNow, consider the composite map $f = \\iota \\circ h^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$.\n-   As the composition of continuous maps, $f$ is continuous.\n-   As the composition of injective maps, $f$ is injective.\n\nThe domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}^m$, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$. We can therefore apply the Invariance of Domain theorem to $f$ (with $k=m$). The theorem implies that the image $f(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ must be an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^m$.\n\nLet's examine the image of $f$:\n$$f(\\mathbb{R}^m) = \\iota(h^{-1}(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\iota(\\mathbb{R}^n)$$\nThe image $\\iota(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ whose last $m-n$ coordinates are zero. This is a proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ because $n < m$. A proper linear subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ has an empty interior and is therefore not an open set.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction: $f(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ must be open by the Invariance of Domain theorem, but it is not open because it is a proper subspace. Thus, our initial assumption that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^m$ must be false. $\\square$\n\n## 2. The Dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n\nThe second part of the proof uses two major results from dimension theory and topology:\n1.  For any $k$-dimensional topological manifold $M$, its Lebesgue covering dimension is equal to its manifold dimension, i.e., $\\dim(M) = k$.\n2.  A contractible $k$-dimensional manifold that is simply connected at infinity is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$. (This follows from work by Stallings, Smale, and Freedman, which generalizes the Poincaré conjecture).\n\n**Theorem 2:** $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$.\n\n*Proof of Theorem:*\nAssume for contradiction that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = k$ for some integer $k \\neq n$.\n\nBy the first result cited above, if the Lebesgue covering dimension of the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $k$, then it must be a $k$-dimensional manifold. This means that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nFurthermore, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is a contractible space. For $n \\ge 2$, it is also simply connected at infinity. (The cases $n=1,2$ are also consistent with the conclusion). By the second major result cited above, these properties imply that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be globally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nHowever, we proved in the Lemma that if $k \\neq n$, $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^k$. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\neq n$ must be false. We conclude that $\\dim(\\mathbb{R}^n) = n$. $\\square$\n\nfinal:Prove that the topological dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $n$."
