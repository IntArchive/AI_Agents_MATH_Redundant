    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the Gaussian integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx and show it's equal to √π \/ 2. Hmm, I remember this is a classic integral, but I need to recall the proof. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-x²} dx. I think the standard approach involves switching to polar coordinates by considering the square of the integral. So maybe if I let I be the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^{-x²} dx, then I² would be the double integral over the first quadrant of e^{-x² - y²} dx dy. Then converting to polar coordinates where x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. But wait, since we're in the first quadrant, the limits for θ would be from 0 to π\/2, and r from 0 to ∞. Then the double integral becomes ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ. That seems manageable. The inner integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr can be solved with substitution: let u = r², du = 2r dr, so (1\/2)∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = 1\/2. Then the outer integral ∫₀^{π\/2} 1\/2 dθ = (1\/2)(π\/2) = π\/4. Therefore, I² = π\/4, so I = √π \/ 2. That checks out. But wait, are there any assumptions here? The original integral is from 0 to infinity, so x is a real variable. The function e^{-x²} is continuous and integrable over [0, ∞). The switch to polar coordinates requires that the double integral converges, which it does because the exponential decays rapidly. So the key assumptions would be that we're integrating over the positive real numbers and using Fubini's theorem to justify the double integral. Maybe also that we can switch the order of integration, but since the integrand is positive and the integral converges, that's valid by Tonelli's theorem. I think the main assumption here is the standard one for this integral: integrating a continuous function over an infinite interval, and the justification for using polar coordinates in the double integral. So the problem as stated doesn't have additional constraints beyond the integral limits and the integrand. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would just be that the integral is over the non-negative real numbers, and the problem is to evaluate it to √π\/2.",

This integral is well-defined because e^{-x²} is a positive, continuous function that converges to 0 rapidly as x → ∞.\n\nConsider the square of the integral, I²:\nI² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy)\n\nSince the integrands are non-negative, we can apply Fubini's theorem to combine the product of integrals into a double integral over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane:\nI² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} e^{-y²} dx dy = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x² + y²)} dx dy\n\nWe now convert this double integral from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). The transformation is given by:\nx = r cos θ\ny = r sin θ\nThe differential area element dx dy becomes r dr dθ.\n\nThe region of integration is the first quadrant, where x ranges from 0 to ∞ and y ranges from 0 to ∞. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to a radius r ranging from 0 to ∞ and an angle θ ranging from 0 to π\/2. The term x² + y² becomes r².\n\nSubstituting these into the integral for I², we get:\nI² = ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\n\nFirst, we evaluate the inner integral with respect to r:\n∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr\nLet u = r², so du = 2r dr, which means r dr = du\/2. The limits of integration remain 0 to ∞.\n∫₀^∞ e^{-u} (du\/2) = (1\/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = (1\/2) [-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = (1\/2) [(-lim_{u→∞} e^{-u}) - (-e⁻⁰)] = (1\/2) [0 - (-1)] = 1\/2\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for I² and evaluate the outer integral with respect to θ:\nI² = ∫₀^{π\/2} (1\/2) dθ = (1\/2) [θ]₀^{π\/2} = (1\/2) (π\/2 - 0) = π\/4\n\nSo, we have I² = π\/4. Since the integrand e^{-x²} is always positive, the integral I must be positive. Taking the positive square root of both sides gives:\nI = √(π\/4) = √π\/2\n\nTherefore, we have proven that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2.\n\nfinal:",
