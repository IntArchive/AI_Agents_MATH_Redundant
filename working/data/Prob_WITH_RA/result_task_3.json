    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the Gaussian integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx and show it's equal to √π \/ 2. Hmm, I remember this is a classic integral, but I need to recall the proof. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-x²} dx. I think the standard approach involves switching to polar coordinates by considering the square of the integral. So maybe if I let I be the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^{-x²} dx, then I² would be the double integral over the first quadrant of e^{-x² - y²} dx dy. Then converting to polar coordinates where x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. But wait, since we're in the first quadrant, the limits for θ would be from 0 to π\/2, and r from 0 to ∞. Then the double integral becomes ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ. That seems manageable. The inner integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr can be solved with substitution: let u = r², du = 2r dr, so (1\/2)∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = 1\/2. Then the outer integral ∫₀^{π\/2} 1\/2 dθ = (1\/2)(π\/2) = π\/4. Therefore, I² = π\/4, so I = √π \/ 2. That checks out. But wait, are there any assumptions here? The original integral is from 0 to infinity, so x is a real variable. The function e^{-x²} is continuous and integrable over [0, ∞). The switch to polar coordinates requires that the double integral converges, which it does because the exponential decays rapidly. So the key assumptions would be that we're integrating over the positive real numbers and using Fubini's theorem to justify the double integral. Maybe also that we can switch the order of integration, but since the integrand is positive and the integral converges, that's valid by Tonelli's theorem. I think the main assumption here is the standard one for this integral: integrating a continuous function over an infinite interval, and the justification for using polar coordinates in the double integral. So the problem as stated doesn't have additional constraints beyond the integral limits and the integrand. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would just be that the integral is over the non-negative real numbers, and the problem is to evaluate it to √π\/2.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\n\n**Problem:**\nProve that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2, given that the integral of e^{-(x²+y²)} over the entire xy-plane, when converted to polar coordinates, is ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ = π.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet I be the integral in question:\nI = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx\n\nLet J be the integral of the same function over the entire real line:\nJ = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-x²} dx\n\nSince e^{-x²} is an even function (i.e., e^{-(-x)²} = e^{-x²}), the integral from -∞ to 0 is equal to the integral from 0 to ∞. Therefore,\nJ = ∫_{-∞}^⁰ e^{-x²} dx + ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = I + I = 2I\n\nNow, let's evaluate J by squaring it:\nJ² = (∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-y²} dy)\nJ² = ∫_{-∞}^∞ ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy\n\nThis double integral is taken over the entire xy-plane. We can convert this Cartesian integral to polar coordinates by setting x = r cos(θ), y = r sin(θ), and dx dy = r dr dθ. The limits of integration for the entire plane are r from 0 to ∞ and θ from 0 to 2π.\nJ² = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\n\nUsing the given assumption that ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ = π, we have:\nJ² = π\n\nSince e^{-x²} is always positive, its integral J must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:\nJ = √π\n\nFinally, we relate J back to our original integral I using the relationship J = 2I:\n2I = √π\nI = √π \/ 2\n\nThus, we have proven that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2.\n\nproof:\n**Problem:**\nProve that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2, given that ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ = π.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Define the integral over the positive real axis as I = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx.\n2.  Define the integral over the entire real axis as J = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-x²} dx.\n3.  Since e^{-x²} is an even function, the integral over (-∞, 0] is the same as over [0, ∞). Thus, J = 2I.\n4.  Square J to form a double integral over the entire xy-plane:\n    J² = (∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-x²} dx)(∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-y²} dy) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy.\n5.  Converting this double integral to polar coordinates (x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ) gives the integral over the entire plane:\n    J² = ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ.\n6.  Using the given assumption, we have J² = π.\n7.  Since the integrand e^{-x²} is strictly positive, J must be positive, so J = √π.\n8.  Substituting J = 2I, we get 2I = √π, which implies I = √π\/2.\n\nfinal:Prove that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2, given that ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ = π.",
