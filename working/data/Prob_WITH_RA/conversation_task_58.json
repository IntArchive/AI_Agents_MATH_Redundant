Suppose, for contradiction, that Bv = 0. Then from equation (1):\n\nABv = A(0) = 0 = λv\n\nSince v ≠ 0, this implies λ = 0, which contradicts our assumption that λ ≠ 0. Therefore, Bv ≠ 0.\n\nThus, we have (BA)(Bv) = λ(Bv) with Bv ≠ 0, which means λ is an eigenvalue of BA with eigenvector Bv.\n\n**Case 2: λ = 0**\n\nIf 0 is an eigenvalue of AB, then AB is singular (not invertible). Therefore, det(AB) = 0.\n\nUsing the property of determinants for square matrices: det(AB) = det(A)det(B) = det(BA).\n\nThus, det(BA) = 0, which implies BA is also singular. A singular matrix has 0 as an eigenvalue. Therefore, 0 is an eigenvalue of BA.\n\nFrom Cases 1 and 2, we have shown that every eigenvalue λ of AB (whether zero or nonzero) is also an eigenvalue of BA.\n\n**Part 2: Show that every eigenvalue of BA is an eigenvalue of AB.**\n\nThis follows by symmetry. Interchanging the roles of A and B in Part 1, we can apply exactly the same argument to show that if μ is an eigenvalue of BA, then μ is also an eigenvalue of AB.\n\nMore formally: Let μ be an eigenvalue of BA. Then by the same reasoning as in Part 1 (with A and B swapped), μ is an eigenvalue of (BA) = (B)(A). But applying the argument with the roles reversed shows μ is an eigenvalue of AB.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have shown:\n1. Every eigenvalue of AB is an eigenvalue of BA.\n2. Every eigenvalue of BA is an eigenvalue of AB.\n\nTherefore, the sets of eigenvalues of AB and BA are equal. That is, AB and BA have the same eigenvalues.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The proof holds for matrices over any field where the determinant properties are valid.\n- The key insight is that for nonzero eigenvalues, if v is an eigenvector of AB with eigenvalue λ, then Bv is an eigenvector of BA with the same eigenvalue λ.\n- For the zero eigenvalue case, we use the determinant property det(AB) = det(BA) to show that if one matrix is singular, so is the other.\n- The symmetry argument completes the proof by showing the inclusion in both directions.",

We will demonstrate that AB and BA share the same set of eigenvalues. The proof is divided into two parts.\n\n**Part 1: Every eigenvalue of AB is an eigenvalue of BA.**\n\nLet λ be an eigenvalue of AB. This means there exists a non-zero vector v such that:\n(1) ABv = λv\n\nWe consider two cases for the value of λ.\n\n**Case 1: λ ≠ 0**\n\nWe pre-multiply both sides of equation (1) by B:\nB(ABv) = B(λv)\n\nUsing the associative property of matrix multiplication and the fact that scalar multiplication commutes, we get:\n(BA)(Bv) = λ(Bv)\n\nTo show that λ is an eigenvalue of BA, we must verify that the vector Bv is non-zero. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that Bv = 0.\nSubstituting Bv = 0 back into equation (1):\nA(Bv) = λv\nA(0) = λv\n0 = λv\n\nSince v is an eigenvector, it is non-zero (v ≠ 0). Therefore, for the equation 0 = λv to hold, λ must be 0. This contradicts our assumption in this case that λ ≠ 0. Thus, our assumption that Bv = 0 must be false.\n\nSince Bv is a non-zero vector, the equation (BA)(Bv) = λ(Bv) shows that λ is an eigenvalue of BA, with Bv as the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n**Case 2: λ = 0**\n\nIf λ = 0 is an eigenvalue of AB, it means that the matrix AB is singular (not invertible). A matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero.\ndet(AB) = 0\n\nUsing the property of determinants that det(XY) = det(X)det(Y) for any square matrices X and Y, we have:\ndet(A)det(B) = 0\n\nSince scalar multiplication is commutative, det(A)det(B) = det(B)det(A). This allows us to write:\ndet(BA) = 0\n\nA determinant of zero implies that the matrix BA is also singular. A singular matrix always has 0 as an eigenvalue.

From Part 2, the set of eigenvalues of BA is a subset of the set of eigenvalues of AB. Therefore, the two sets of eigenvalues are identical.
