    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the Gaussian integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx and show it's equal to √π \/ 2. Hmm, I remember this is a classic integral, but I need to recall the proof. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-x²} dx. I think the standard approach involves switching to polar coordinates by considering the square of the integral. So maybe if I let I be the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^{-x²} dx, then I² would be the double integral over the first quadrant of e^{-x² - y²} dx dy. Then converting to polar coordinates where x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. But wait, since we're in the first quadrant, the limits for θ would be from 0 to π\/2, and r from 0 to ∞. Then the double integral becomes ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ. That seems manageable. The inner integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr can be solved with substitution: let u = r², du = 2r dr, so (1\/2)∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = 1\/2. Then the outer integral ∫₀^{π\/2} 1\/2 dθ = (1\/2)(π\/2) = π\/4. Therefore, I² = π\/4, so I = √π \/ 2. That checks out. But wait, are there any assumptions here? The original integral is from 0 to infinity, so x is a real variable. The function e^{-x²} is continuous and integrable over [0, ∞). The switch to polar coordinates requires that the double integral converges, which it does because the exponential decays rapidly. So the key assumptions would be that we're integrating over the positive real numbers and using Fubini's theorem to justify the double integral. Maybe also that we can switch the order of integration, but since the integrand is positive and the integral converges, that's valid by Tonelli's theorem. I think the main assumption here is the standard one for this integral: integrating a continuous function over an infinite interval, and the justification for using polar coordinates in the double integral. So the problem as stated doesn't have additional constraints beyond the integral limits and the integrand. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would just be that the integral is over the non-negative real numbers, and the problem is to evaluate it to √π\/2.",

Let $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$.\n2. Consider $I^2 = \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx\\right)\\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-y^2} dy\\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x^2+y^2)} dx dy$ by Fubini's theorem (justified since the integrand is continuous and positive).\n3. Convert to polar coordinates: $x = r\\cos\\theta$, $y = r\\sin\\theta$, with Jacobian $dx dy = r dr d\\theta$. Since $x,y \\in [0,\\infty)$, we have $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi\/2]$ and $r \\in [0,\\infty)$.\n4. Thus $I^2 = \\int_{0}^{\\pi\/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-r^2} r dr d\\theta$.\n5. Evaluate the inner integral: $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-r^2} r dr$. Use substitution $u = r^2$, $du = 2r dr$, so $r dr = du\/2$. Then $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-r^2} r dr = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n6. Therefore $I^2 = \\int_{0}^{\\pi\/2} \\frac{1}{2} d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n7. Hence $I = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\nQED.\n",

This integral converges since e^{-x²} is continuous on [0,∞) and decays exponentially as x→∞.\n\nStep 2: Consider I² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx)(∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy). Since both integrals converge absolutely (e^{-x²} ≥ 0 and integrable), we can write this as a product of integrals.\n\nStep 3: By Fubini's theorem, which applies since e^{-x²}e^{-y²} = e^{-(x²+y²)} is non-negative and integrable over [0,∞)×[0,∞), we can combine the integrals:\nI² = ∫₀^∞∫₀^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy.\n\nStep 4: Convert to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r ≥ 0 and θ ∈ [0, 2π). The Jacobian determinant of this transformation is r, so dx dy = r dr dθ.\n\nStep 5: Determine the integration limits. Since x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (original integration over first quadrant), we have θ ∈ [0, π\/2] and r ∈ [0, ∞). The integrand becomes e^{-(r² cos²θ + r² sin²θ)} = e^{-r²}.\n\nThus, I² = ∫_{θ=0}^{π\/2} ∫_{r=0}^{∞} e^{-r²} r dr dθ.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the inner integral with respect to r. Use substitution u = r², so du = 2r dr, and r dr = du\/2. When r = 0, u = 0; when r → ∞, u → ∞. Then:\n∫_{r=0}^{∞} e^{-r²} r dr = ∫_{u=0}^{∞} e^{-u} (du\/2) = (1\/2)∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-u} du = (1\/2)[-e^{-u}]_{0}^{∞} = (1\/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1\/2.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the outer integral with respect to θ:\nI² = ∫_{θ=0}^{π\/2} (1\/2) dθ = (1\/2)∫_{0}^{π\/2} dθ = (1\/2)[θ]_{0}^{π\/2} = (1\/2)(π\/2 - 0) = π\/4.\n\nStep 8: Since I = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx ≥ 0 (integrand is positive), we take the positive square root:\nI = √(π\/4) = √π\/√4 = √π\/2.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2. ∎",
    "final reviewer":"```json\n{\n\"proof_review\": true,\n\"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:** Prove that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2\n\n**Proof:**\nLet the integral be denoted by I.\nI = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx.\n\nWe consider the square of this integral, I², which can be written as a product of two integrals with different dummy variables:\nI² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy).\n\nSince the integrand e^{-x²}e^{-y²} = e^{-(x²+y²)} is non-negative and continuous over the domain [0,∞)×[0,∞), we can combine the product of integrals into a double integral over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane:\nI² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy.\n\nTo evaluate this double integral, we switch to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. The integration region, being the first quadrant, corresponds to r ranging from 0 to ∞ and θ from 0 to π\/2. The differential element dx dy becomes r dr dθ, and the term x² + y² becomes r².\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\nI² = ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ.\n\nWe first evaluate the inner integral with respect to r using the substitution u = r², which implies du = 2r dr, or r dr = du\/2. The limits for u are from 0²=0 to ∞.\n∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr = ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} (1\/2) du = (1\/2) [-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = (1\/2) (lim_{u→∞}(-e^{-u}) - (-e⁻⁰)) = (1\/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1\/2.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for I² and evaluate the outer integral with respect to θ:\nI² = ∫₀^{π\/2} (1\/2) dθ = (1\/2) [θ]₀^{π\/2} = (1\/2) (π\/2 - 0) = π\/4.\n\nSo, we have I² = π\/4. Since the integrand e^{-x²} is strictly positive for all x, the integral I must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:\nI = √(π\/4) = √π\/2.\n\nThis completes the proof. ∎\n\nfinal:"
