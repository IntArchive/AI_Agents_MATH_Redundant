The spectrum of $A$, denoted $\\sigma(A)$, is the set of all eigenvalues of $A$.

The transpose of a difference of matrices is the difference of their transposes: $(A - B)^T = A^T - B^T$. Also, for a scalar $c$, $(cM)^T = cM^T$.

The spectrum of $A$, denoted $\\sigma(A)$, is the set of all eigenvalues of $A$. We want to show that $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)$.\n\n1.  **Definition of Eigenvalues via the Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    An element $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $M$ if and only if it is a root of the characteristic polynomial, which is defined by the equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $M$.\n    Thus, $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A)$ if and only if $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    Similarly, $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A^T)$ if and only if $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Properties of Transpose and Determinant:**\n    We use two fundamental properties of matrices:\n    a) For any square matrix $M$, its transpose is $M^T$. The transpose of a difference of matrices is the difference of their transposes: $(A - B)^T = A^T - B^T$. Also, for a scalar $c$, $(cM)^T = cM^T$. The identity matrix is symmetric, so $I^T = I$.\n    b) For any square matrix $M$, the determinant of the matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose: $\\det(M) = \\det(M^T)$.\n\n3.  **Relating the Characteristic Polynomials:**\n    Let's consider the characteristic polynomial of $A^T$, which is $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I)$.\n    Using the properties of the transpose from step 2a, we can rewrite the term inside the determinant:\n    $$ A^T - \\lambda I = A^T - \\lambda I^T = A^T - (\\lambda I)^T = (A - \\lambda I)^T $$\n    Now, we can substitute this back into the characteristic equation for $A^T$:\n    $$ \\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = \\det((A - \\lambda I)^T) $$\n    Using the determinant property from step 2b, where $M = A - \\lambda I$, we have:\n    $$ \\det((A - \\lambda I)^T) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) $$\n    Combining these equalities, we find that the characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $A^T$ are identical:\n    $$ \\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $A^T$ are the same, they must have the same set of roots.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda$ is a root of $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$ if and only if it is a root of $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    This means that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if it is an eigenvalue of $A^T$.\n    Consequently, the set of eigenvalues for $A$ and $A^T$ are identical.\n    $$ \\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T) $$\nThis completes the proof.\n\nfinal:"
