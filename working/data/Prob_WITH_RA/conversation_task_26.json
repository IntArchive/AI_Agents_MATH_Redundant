Then R is a ring.\\n\\n**Proof:**\\n\\n1. **Polynomial Ring Structure:** Consider the polynomial ring ℂ[x,y,z] in three variables x, y, z over the field ℂ of complex numbers. By definition, ℂ[x,y,z] consists of all polynomials in variables x, y, z with coefficients in ℂ. Standard polynomial addition and multiplication make ℂ[x,y,z] a commutative ring with identity 1.\\n\\n2. **Properties of Polynomial Rings over Fields:** For any field F, the polynomial ring F[x₁,...,xₙ] in n variables is a commutative ring with identity. Specifically, ℂ is a field, so ℂ[x,y,z] is a commutative ring with identity. The ring operations are defined componentwise: addition of polynomials is coefficient-wise addition, and multiplication is given by the distributive law and the rule xᵃyᵇzᶜ · xᵈyᵉzᶠ = xᵃ⁺ᵈyᵇ⁺ᵉzᶜ⁺ᶠ.\\n\\n3. **The Polynomial f(x,y,z) = xy - (1 - z²):** Let f(x,y,z) = xy - (1 - z²) = xy - 1 + z². This is clearly a polynomial in ℂ[x,y,z] since it is a finite sum of monomials with coefficients in ℂ: xy has coefficient 1, -1 is constant term, and z² has coefficient 1.\\n\\n4. **Ideal Generated by f:** The set I = (f) = {g·f | g ∈ ℂ[x,y,z]} is the principal ideal generated by f in ℂ[x,y,z]. By definition of an ideal in a commutative ring: (a) I is an additive subgroup of ℂ[x,y,z], and (b) For any r ∈ ℂ[x,y,z] and i ∈ I, we have r·i ∈ I. Since f ∈ ℂ[x,y,z], the set I = (f) is indeed an ideal of ℂ[x,y,z].\\n\\n5. **Quotient Ring Theorem:** Let A be a ring and I ⊆ A an ideal. Then the quotient A/I = {a + I | a ∈ A} is a ring under the operations:\\n   (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I\\n   (a + I) · (b + I) = (a·b) + I\\n   The zero element is 0 + I = I, and the multiplicative identity is 1 + I. These operations are well-defined because I is an ideal: if a₁ + I = a₂ + I and b₁ + I = b₂ + I, then a₁ - a₂ ∈ I and b₁ - b₂ ∈ I, so (a₁ + b₁) - (a₂ + b₂) ∈ I and a₁b₁ - a₂b₂ = a₁(b₁ - b₂) + (a₁ - a₂)b₂ ∈ I.\\n\\n6. **Application to Our Case:** Take A = ℂ[x,y,z] (a commutative ring with identity) and I = (xy - (1 - z²)) (an ideal of ℂ[x,y,z]). By the quotient ring theorem, R = A/I = ℂ[x,y,z]/(xy - (1 - z²)) is a ring. Specifically, R inherits the ring structure from ℂ[x,y,z]:\\n   - Addition: (p + I) + (q + I) = (p + q) + I\\n   - Multiplication: (p + I) · (q + I) = (p·q) + I\\n   - Zero: 0 + I = I\\n   - Identity: 1 + I\\n\\n7. **Verification of Ring Axioms:** Since R is constructed as a quotient ring, all ring axioms are automatically satisfied:\\n   - **Additive associativity:** (a+I)+(b+I)+(c+I) = (a+b+c)+I = a+I+(b+I+c+I)\\n   - **Additive commutativity:** (a+I)+(b+I) = (a+b)+I = (b+a)+I = (b+I)+(a+I)\\n   - **Additive identity:** 0+I serves as zero since (a+I)+(0+I) = (a+0)+I = a+I\\n   - **Additive inverses:** For any a+I, its inverse is (-a)+I since (a+I)+(-a+I) = (a-a)+I = 0+I\\n   - **Multiplicative associativity:** (a+I)(b+I)(c+I) = (abc)+I = (a+I)[(b+I)(c+I)]\\n   - **Multiplicative identity:** 1+I serves as identity since (a+I)(1+I) = (a·1)+I = a+I\\n   - **Distributivity:** (a+I)[(b+I)+(c+I)] = (a(b+c))+I = (ab+ac)+I = (a+I)(b+I)+(a+I)(c+I)\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, R = ℂ[x,y,z]/(xy - (1 - z²)) is indeed a ring. ∎\"\n}\n```"
