Then there exists $xZ(G) \\in G/Z(G)$ such that $G/Z(G) = \\langle xZ(G) \\rangle$. For any $g \\in G$, the coset $gZ(G)$ can be written as $(xZ(G))^m = x^mZ(G)$ for some integer $m$. Thus $g = x^m z$ for some $z \\in Z(G)$. Now take any two elements $g_1, g_2 \\in G$. Write $g_1 = x^{m_1} z_1$ and $g_2 = x^{m_2} z_2$ where $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$. Then: $g_1g_2 = x^{m_1}z_1 x^{m_2}z_2 = x^{m_1}x^{m_2}z_1z_2 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$ and $g_2g_1 = x^{m_2}z_2 x^{m_1}z_1 = x^{m_2}x^{m_1}z_2z_1 = x^{m_2+m_1}z_2z_1 = x^{m_1+m_2}z_1z_2$. Since $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$, they commute with all elements, and $x^{m_1}x^{m_2} = x^{m_2}x^{m_1} = x^{m_1+m_2}$. Therefore $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$, so $G$ is abelian.\n"

Prove that $G$ is abelian.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $Z(G)$ be the center of $G$. We are given that the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic. This means there exists an element $x \\in G$ such that the coset $xZ(G)$ is a generator for $G/Z(G)$.\nTherefore, for any element $g \\in G$, its coset $gZ(G)$ can be expressed as a power of the generator:\n$gZ(G) = (xZ(G))^m = x^mZ(G)$ for some integer $m$.\n\nThis equality of cosets implies that $g \\in x^mZ(G)$, which means $g$ can be written in the form $g = x^m z$ for some element $z \\in Z(G)$.\n\nNow, let $g_1$ and $g_2$ be any two arbitrary elements in $G$. Based on the above, we can write them as:\n$g_1 = x^{m_1} z_1$\n$g_2 = x^{m_2} z_2$\nfor some integers $m_1, m_2$ and some elements $z_1, z_2 \\in Z(G)$.\n\nLet's compute the product $g_1g_2$:\n$g_1g_2 = (x^{m_1} z_1)(x^{m_2} z_2)$\nSince $z_1$ is in the center of $G$, it commutes with all elements of $G$, including $x^{m_2}$. Thus, $z_1x^{m_2} = x^{m_2}z_1$.\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1} (z_1 x^{m_2}) z_2 = x^{m_1} (x^{m_2} z_1) z_2 = (x^{m_1} x^{m_2}) (z_1 z_2) = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$.\n\nNow, let's compute the product $g_2g_1$:\n$g_2g_1 = (x^{m_2} z_2)(x^{m_1} z_1)$\nSince $z_2 \\in Z(G)$, it commutes with $x^{m_1}$, so $z_2x^{m_1} = x^{m_1}z_2$.\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_2} (z_2 x^{m_1}) z_1 = x^{m_2} (x^{m_1} z_2) z_1 = (x^{m_2} x^{m_1}) (z_2 z_1) = x^{m_2+m_1} z_2 z_1$.\n\nWe know that integer addition is commutative, so $m_1+m_2 = m_2+m_1$. Also, since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are both in the center $Z(G)$, they commute with all elements of $G$, which means they commute with each other ($z_1z_2 = z_2z_1$).\nTherefore, we have:\n$g_1g_2 = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$\n$g_2g_1 = x^{m_1+m_2} z_1 z_2$\n\nThis shows that $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$. Since $g_1$ and $g_2$ were arbitrary elements of $G$, the group $G$ is abelian. ∎"
