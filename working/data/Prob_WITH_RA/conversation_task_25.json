In the 10-adic number system, this can be expressed as the formal infinite sum:\\n   $$x = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} 9 \\\\cdot 10^k = 9 + 90 + 900 + 9000 + \\\\cdots$$\\n\\n2. **Multiply by 0.1 (or equivalently, divide by 10):**\\n   In the 10-adic system, multiplication by 0.1 corresponds to shifting the decimal point one place to the left. Applying this operation to x:\\n   $$0.1x = ...9999.9$$\\n   This can be understood as: if x has infinitely many 9's to the left of the decimal point, then 0.1x has the same infinite string of 9's to the left, followed by a 9 in the tenths place.\\n\\n3. **Subtract x from 0.1x:**\\n   Perform the subtraction 0.1x - x:\\n   $$0.1x - x = ...9999.9 - ...9999.0$$\\n   \\n   To compute this subtraction, we can think of it digit by digit from right to left:\\n   - In the tenths place: 9 - 0 = 9\\n   - In the units place: 9 - 9 = 0, but we need to borrow from the tens place\\n   - In the tens place: 9 - 9 = 0, but we borrowed so it becomes 8 - 9, requiring another borrow\\n   - This borrowing process continues indefinitely to the left\\n   \\n   The result of this infinite subtraction is simply:\\n   $$0.1x - x = 0.9$$\\n   \\n   This can be verified by noting that the infinite borrowing process leaves only the 0.9 in the fractional part, with all integer digits canceling out.\\n\\n4. **Solve for x:**\\n   From the equation 0.1x - x = 0.9, we have:\\n   $$-0.9x = 0.9$$\\n   Dividing both sides by -0.9:\\n   $$x = -1$$\\n\\n5. **Interpretation and convergence:**\\n   Since we have shown that x = -1, and x was defined as ∑_{k=0}^{∞} 9·10^k, we conclude:\\n   $$\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} 9 \\\\cdot 10^k = -1$$\\n   \\n   The series converges to the finite value -1 in the 10-adic number system. The convergence is in the 10-adic metric, where two numbers are close if their difference is divisible by a high power of 10.\\n\\n6. **Verification of convergence in 10-adic sense:**\\n   Let S_n = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} 9·10^k be the partial sum. Then:\\n   $$S_n = 9 + 90 + 900 + \\\\cdots + 9\\\\cdot10^{n-1} = 10^n - 1$$\\n   \\n   In the 10-adic metric, the distance between S_n and -1 is:\\n   $$|S_n - (-1)|_{10} = |(10^n - 1) + 1|_{10} = |10^n|_{10} = 10^{-n}$$\\n   \\n   As n → ∞, 10^{-n} → 0 in the 10-adic metric. Therefore, the partial sums S_n converge to -1 in the 10-adic sense.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The infinite series ∑_{k=0}^{∞} 9·10^k converges to the finite value -1 in the 10-adic number system. This result demonstrates the non-archimedean nature of p-adic numbers, where series that diverge in the usual real number sense can converge to finite values in p-adic systems.\\n\\n**Note:** This proof relies on the algebraic properties of the 10-adic number system, where operations like multiplication by 0.1 and subtraction of infinite expressions are well-defined. The key insight is that in the 10-adic system, the number ...9999 behaves algebraically like -1, which is consistent with the equation 0.1x - x = 0.9 leading to x = -1.\"\n}\n```",
