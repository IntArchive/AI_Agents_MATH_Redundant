Since A is diagonalizable, there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} of Fⁿ consisting of eigenvectors of A. Let λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ be the corresponding eigenvalues, so that A vᵢ = λᵢ vᵢ for i = 1, 2, ..., n.\\n\\n2. Now consider any eigenvector vᵢ from this basis. Using the commutativity AB = BA, we compute:\\n   A(B vᵢ) = B(A vᵢ) = B(λᵢ vᵢ) = λᵢ (B vᵢ).\\n\\n3. The equation A(B vᵢ) = λᵢ (B vᵢ) shows that B vᵢ is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λᵢ, or B vᵢ = 0 (which is trivially in the eigenspace). Thus B vᵢ ∈ E_A(λᵢ), the eigenspace of A corresponding to λᵢ.\\n\\n4. Since A is diagonalizable, each eigenspace E_A(λᵢ) has dimension equal to the algebraic multiplicity of λᵢ. In particular, for a simple eigenvalue (which may not be the case generally), the eigenspace is 1-dimensional. However, the key observation is that vᵢ itself spans a 1-dimensional subspace of E_A(λᵢ) (it's nonzero by definition of being a basis vector). Since B vᵢ ∈ E_A(λᵢ) and vᵢ spans a 1-dimensional subspace, B vᵢ must be a scalar multiple of vᵢ. That is, there exists μᵢ ∈ F such that B vᵢ = μᵢ vᵢ.\\n\\n5. The equation B vᵢ = μᵢ vᵢ precisely means that vᵢ is an eigenvector of B with eigenvalue μᵢ.\\n\\n6.

Diagonal matrices always commute. Indeed, for any two diagonal matrices D_A = diag(λ₁, ..., λₙ) and D_B = diag(μ₁, ..., μₙ), we have:\\n   (D_A D_B)ᵢⱼ = λᵢ μᵢ δᵢⱼ = μᵢ λᵢ δᵢⱼ = (D_B D_A)ᵢⱼ,\\n   where δᵢⱼ is the Kronecker delta.
