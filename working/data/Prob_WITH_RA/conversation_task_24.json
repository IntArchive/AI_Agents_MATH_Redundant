Then the specific case with x=2 and y=3 gives (-2)*(-3) = 2*3 = 6.\n\n1. By Assumption 2 (additive inverse), for any real number x, there exists -x such that x + (-x) = 0.\n2. Consider 0 * (-y). Since 0 times any number is 0, we have 0 * (-y) = 0.\n3. Using Assumption 1 (distributive property):\n   0 = 0 * (-y) = [x + (-x)] * (-y) = x*(-y) + (-x)*(-y)\n4. Similarly, consider x * 0:\n   0 = x * 0 = x * [y + (-y)] = xy + x*(-y) (using distributive property)\n5. From step 3: x*(-y) + (-x)*(-y) = 0\n   From step 4: xy + x*(-y) = 0\n6. Subtract the second equation from the first:\n   [x*(-y) + (-x)*(-y)] - [xy + x*(-y)] = 0 - 0\n   Simplifying: (-x)*(-y) - xy = 0\n7. Therefore, (-x)*(-y) = xy\n\nNow, substituting x = 2 and y = 3:\n(-2)*(-3) = 2*3 = 6\n\nThus, we have proved that (-2)*(-3) = 6 using only Assumptions 1, 2, and 4.

This proof relies on the following axioms for real numbers: the existence of additive inverses, the distributive property, and the property of multiplication by zero.\n\n1.  Consider the expression $x \\cdot [y + (-y)]$.\n    By the additive inverse property, $y + (-y) = 0$, so $x \\cdot [y + (-y)] = x \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    By the distributive property, $x \\cdot [y + (-y)] = xy + x(-y)$.\n    Therefore, we have $xy + x(-y) = 0$.

Consider the expression $[x + (-x)] \\cdot (-y)$.\n    By the additive inverse property, $x + (-x) = 0$, so $[x + (-x)] \\cdot (-y) = 0 \\cdot (-y) = 0$.\n    By the distributive property, $[x + (-x)] \\cdot (-y) = x(-y) + (-x)(-y)$.\n    Therefore, we have $x(-y) + (-x)(-y) = 0$. (Equation 2)\n\n3.  From Equation 1 and Equation 2, both expressions are equal to 0, so they are equal to each other:\n    $xy + x(-y) = x(-y) + (-x)(-y)$\n\n4.  Subtracting $x(-y)$ from both sides of the equation yields:\n    $xy = (-x)(-y)$\n\nThis proves the general result. Now, we apply this to the specific case by setting $x=2$ and $y=3$:\n$(-2)(-3) = (2)(3)$\n\nSince $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$, we conclude that:\n$(-2)(-3) = 6$"
