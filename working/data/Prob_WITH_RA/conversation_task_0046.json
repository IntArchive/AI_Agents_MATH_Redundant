Since f is continuously differentiable (hence continuous) on the closed interval [ax,bx], these minimum and maximum exist.\n\nStep 2) For all u in [ax,bx], we have the inequality: m(x) ≤ f(u) ≤ M(x).\n\nStep 3) Since u > 0 on [ax,bx] (as a, b, x > 0), we can divide by u to obtain: m(x)/u ≤ f(u)/u ≤ M(x)/u for all u∈[ax,bx].\n\nStep 4) Integrate these inequalities from ax to bx: ∫_{ax}^{bx} m(x)/u du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} f(u)/u du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} M(x)/u du.\n\nStep 5) Factor out the constants m(x) and M(x): m(x)∫_{ax}^{bx} 1/u du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} f(u)/u du ≤ M(x)∫_{ax}^{bx} 1/u du.\n\nStep 6) Compute the integral ∫_{ax}^{bx} 1/u du = ln(bx) - ln(ax) = ln(b) + ln(x) - ln(a) - ln(x) = ln(b/a).\n\nStep 7) Substitute this result back to obtain the desired inequality: m(x)ln(b/a) ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} f(u)/u du ≤ M(x)ln(b/a).\n\nNote: The assumptions that f is continuously differentiable and lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0 are not directly used in proving this inequality; they may be relevant for additional context or subsequent parts of a larger problem.",
        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $f$ is a function from $[0, \\infty)$ to $\\mathbb{R}$,\nAssumption 2: $f$ is continuously differentiable,\nAssumption 3: the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\to \\infty$ is $0$,\nAssumption 4: $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that $$m(x)\\ln\\left(\\dfrac ba\\right)\\leq \\int_{ax}^{bx}\\dfrac{f(u)}udu\\leq M(x)\\ln\\left(\\dfrac ba\\right)$$\nWe will prove the inequality step by step:\n\n1. **Definition of m(x) and M(x)**: Since f is continuously differentiable on [0, ∞), it is in particular continuous on any closed interval [ax, bx] where a, b > 0 and x > 0. By the Extreme Value Theorem for continuous functions on closed intervals, f attains both a minimum and maximum on [ax, bx]. Define:\n   m(x) = min_{u∈[ax,bx]} f(u)\n   M(x) = max_{u∈[ax,bx]} f(u)\n   These values exist for each x > 0.\n\n2. **Pointwise inequality**: For all u in the interval [ax, bx], by definition of minimum and maximum, we have:\n   m(x) ≤ f(u) ≤ M(x)\n\n3. **Division by positive u**: Since a, b, x > 0, the interval [ax, bx] consists of positive numbers (u > 0). Therefore, we can divide the inequality by u > 0 to obtain:\n   m(x)/u ≤ f(u)/u ≤ M(x)/u for all u ∈ [ax, bx]\n\n4. **Integration of inequalities**: The integral preserves inequalities for integrable functions. Since f is continuously differentiable, f(u)/u is continuous on [ax, bx] (as the quotient of continuous functions with denominator nonzero), hence integrable. Integrating from ax to bx:\n   ∫_{ax}^{bx} (m(x)/u) du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} (f(u)/u) du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} (M(x)/u) du\n\n5. **Factoring constants**: Since m(x) and M(x) are constants with respect to the integration variable u, we can factor them out:\n   m(x) ∫_{ax}^{bx} (1/u) du ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} (f(u)/u) du ≤ M(x) ∫_{ax}^{bx} (1/u) du\n\n6. **Computing the integral**: The integral ∫ (1/u) du from ax to bx is:\n   ∫_{ax}^{bx} (1/u) du = [ln|u|]_{ax}^{bx} = ln(bx) - ln(ax)\n   Since bx > 0 and ax > 0, we can write:\n   ln(bx) - ln(ax) = ln(b) + ln(x) - ln(a) - ln(x) = ln(b) - ln(a) = ln(b/a)\n   The natural logarithm properties used are: ln(xy) = ln(x) + ln(y) and ln(x/y) = ln(x) - ln(y).\n\n7. **Final substitution**: Substituting the result from step 6 into the inequality from step 5 gives:\n   m(x) ln(b/a) ≤ ∫_{ax}^{bx} (f(u)/u) du ≤ M(x) ln(b/a)\n\nThis completes the proof of the desired inequality.\n\n**Note on assumptions**: The assumptions that f is continuously differentiable and lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0 are not directly used in proving this inequality. The continuous differentiability ensures f is continuous, which guarantees the existence of m(x) and M(x) via the Extreme Value Theorem. The limit condition may be relevant for additional context or subsequent parts of a larger problem, such as analyzing the behavior of the inequality as x → ∞.",
