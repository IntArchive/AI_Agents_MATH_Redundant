    "AcceptedAnswer":"$$|x| + |y -x| \\ge |x + y -x| = |y|$$ $$|y| + |x -y| \\ge |y + x -y| = |x|$$ Move $|x|$ to the right hand side in the first inequality and $|y|$ to the right hand side in the second inequality. We get $$|y -x| \\ge |y| - |x|$$ $$|x -y| \\ge |x| -|y|.$$ From absolute value properties, we know that $|y-x| = |x-y|,$ and if $t \\ge a$ and $t \\ge −a$ then $t \\ge |a|$ . Combining these two facts together, we get the reverse triangle inequality: $$|x-y| \\ge \\bigl||x|-|y|\\bigr|.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove the reverse triangle inequality, ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|, using only the standard triangle inequality which states |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the triangle inequality and think about how to manipulate it to get the reverse form. The reverse triangle inequality deals with the absolute difference of the magnitudes of x and y, so maybe I can express |x| and |y| in terms of each other using the triangle inequality.\n\nLet me start by considering |x| = |x - y + y|. Applying the triangle inequality here, we get |x| ≤ |x - y| + |y|. If I rearrange this inequality, it becomes |x| - |y| ≤ |x - y|. Similarly, if I switch x and y, I have |y| - |x| ≤ |y - x|. Since |y - x| is the same as |x - y|, this simplifies to |y| - |x| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nCombining these two results, we see that both |x| - |y| and |y| - |x| are less than or equal to |x - y|. The maximum of these two expressions is exactly ||x| - |y||, which means that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nWait, but does this cover all cases? Let me check with some examples. Suppose x and y are both positive. If x > y, then |x| - |y| = x - y, and |x - y| is x - y, so equality holds. If y > x, then |y| - |x| = y - x, which is equal to |x - y|. So in these cases, the inequality holds as equality. What if one is positive and the other negative? Let's say x is positive and y is negative. Then |x| - |y| would be x - (-y) if y is negative, but wait, y is negative so |y| = -y. So |x| - |y| is x - (-y) = x + y. But |x - y| would be |x - (-|y|)| = |x + |y||, which is x + |y| since both are positive. So |x| - |y| = x + y (if y is negative) compared to |x - y| = x + |y|. Wait, if y is negative, then |y| = -y, so |x - y| = x - y (since y is negative, subtracting a negative is adding). But x - y would be x + |y|. So |x| - |y| = x - |y|. So x - |y| ≤ x + |y|, which is always true because |y| is non-negative. But this seems like a different approach. Maybe my initial approach still holds. \n\nAlternatively, another way is to note that ||x| - |y|| is the maximum of |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and both are less than or equal to |x - y| as per the triangle inequality applications. Therefore, combining these gives the desired result. \n\nSo the key steps are applying the triangle inequality to |x| and |y| by expressing them as |x - y + y| and |y - x + x|, then rearranging to get inequalities involving |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and finally recognizing that the absolute value of their difference is bounded by |x - y|.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"\nWe will prove the reverse triangle inequality ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y| for all real numbers x and y, using only the standard triangle inequality.\n\n**Step 1: Recall the triangle inequality**\nFor any real numbers a and b, we have:\n|a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|  (1)\n\n**Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality to x expressed as (x - y) + y**\nWe can write x = (x - y) + y. Applying the triangle inequality (1) with a = x - y and b = y, we get:\n|x| = |(x - y) + y| ≤ |x - y| + |y|  (2)\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange inequality (2)**\nFrom (2), we can subtract |y| from both sides to obtain:\n|x| - |y| ≤ |x - y|  (3)\n\n**Step 4: Apply the triangle inequality to y expressed as (y - x) + x**\nSimilarly, we can write y = (y - x) + x.

Therefore, (4) becomes:\n|y| ≤ |x - y| + |x|  (5)\n\n**Step 6: Rearrange inequality (5)**\nFrom (5), we can subtract |x| from both sides to obtain:\n|y| - |x| ≤ |x - y|  (6)\n\n**Step 7: Combine inequalities (3) and (6)**\nWe now have two inequalities:\n|x| - |y| ≤ |x - y|  (from (3))\n|y| - |x| ≤ |x - y|  (from (6))\n\n**Step 8: Relate these to the absolute value of the difference**\nRecall that for any real number z, |z| = max(z, -z). In particular:\n||x| - |y|| = max(|x| - |y|, |y| - |x|)\n\n**Step 9: Conclude the proof**\nSince both |x| - |y| and |y| - |x| are less than or equal to |x - y|, their maximum is also less than or equal to |x - y|. Therefore:\n||x| - |y|| = max(|x| - |y|, |y| - |x|) ≤ |x - y|\n\nThis completes the proof of the reverse triangle inequality: ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y| for all real numbers x and y.\n\n**Alternative perspective:** The inequalities (3) and (6) show that both |x| - |y| and its negative (|y| - |x|) are bounded above by |x - y|. Since the absolute value ||x| - |y|| is either |x| - |y| or |y| - |x|, depending on which is non-negative, it follows that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|.\n\n**Verification:** The proof uses only the standard triangle inequality and basic algebraic manipulations, making it valid for all real numbers x and y.",
