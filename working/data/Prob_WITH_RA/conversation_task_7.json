The inequality relation $>$ is defined on the set of real numbers. In standard mathematical notation, when we write $p > 1$ without specifying the number system, it is understood that $p$ belongs to the real numbers, as the ordering relation $>$ is only defined for real numbers (or subsets thereof like rational numbers, but these are contained in the reals). Therefore, from $p > 1$, we can deduce that $p$ must be a real number. More formally: The statement $p > 1$ implies that $p$ is comparable to 1 via the standard ordering, which is defined on the real number system. Hence, $p$ is a real number.\n"
