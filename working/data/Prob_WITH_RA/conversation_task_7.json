If the partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k^p}$ of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ satisfy the inequality $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$ for all integers $k \\geq 0$, show that the series converges and that $p > 1$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nLet the series be $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ and its partial sums be $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k^p}$. We are given the inequality for the odd-indexed partial sums:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} \\quad \\text{for all } k \\geq 0$$\n\n1.  **Isolate the partial sum term.**\n    Rearranging the inequality, we get:\n    $$S_{2k+1} - 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} < 1$$\n    $$S_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$$\n\n2.  **Determine the condition on $p$.**\n    The terms of the series are positive, so the partial sums $S_{2k+1}$ are always positive. For the inequality to provide an upper bound on $S_{2k+1}$, the coefficient $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ must be positive. If it were zero or negative, the inequality would either be trivial ($0 < 1$) or would provide a lower bound, not the upper bound needed to prove convergence.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    $$1 - 2^{1-p} > 0$$\n    $$1 > 2^{1-p}$$\n    Since $y=2^x$ is a strictly increasing function, we can compare the exponents:\n    $$0 > 1-p$$\n    $$p > 1$$\n\n3.  **Bound the partial sums.**\n    Now that we have established $p > 1$, we know that $1 - 2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant. We can divide the inequality by this constant without changing its direction:\n    $$S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$$\n    Let $M = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$. Since $p > 1$, $M$ is a finite positive constant. This shows that all odd-indexed partial sums are bounded above by $M$.\n\n    Now consider any partial sum $S_n$.\n    - If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$ for some $k$, and we have $S_n < M$.\n    - If $n$ is even, $n=2k$ for some $k$, we can use the fact that the terms $\\frac{1}{n^p}$ are positive, which makes the sequence of partial sums strictly increasing ($S_n < S_{n+1}$).\n      $$S_{2k} < S_{2k+1} < M$$\n    Thus, for any integer $n \\geq 1$, the partial sum $S_n$ is bounded above by $M$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem.**\n    The sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ has two properties:\n    - It is **monotonically increasing**, since $S_{n+1} = S_n + \\frac{1}{(n+1)^p}$ and $\\frac{1}{(n+1)^p} > 0$.\n    - It is **bounded above** by $M$.\n\n    By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, any sequence that is both monotonically increasing and bounded above must converge to a finite limit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe given inequality implies that $p > 1$. For such values of $p$, the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded above, which proves that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges.\n\nfinal:Let $p$ be a real number. If the partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k^p}$ of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ satisfy the inequality $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$ for all integers $k \\geq 0$, show that the series converges and that $p > 1$.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe are given the inequality $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$. Rearranging the terms, we get $S_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$.\nSince the terms of the series are positive, the partial sums $S_{2k+1}$ are positive. To obtain a meaningful upper bound for $S_{2k+1}$ from this inequality, the coefficient $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ must be positive.\n$$1 - 2^{1-p} > 0 \\implies 1 > 2^{1-p} \\implies 2^0 > 2^{1-p}$$\nSince $y=2^x$ is a strictly increasing function, this implies $0 > 1-p$, which means $p > 1$.\n\nWith $p > 1$, we can divide by the positive constant $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ to find an upper bound for the odd partial sums:\n$$S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$$\nLet $M = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$. The sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is strictly increasing because all its terms are positive. For any even partial sum $S_{2k}$, we have $S_{2k} < S_{2k+1} < M$. Therefore, all partial sums $S_n$ are bounded above by $M$.\n\nThe sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is monotonically increasing and bounded above. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence converges. Therefore, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges."

If the partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k^p}$ of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ satisfy the inequality $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}$ for all integers $k \\geq 0$, show that the series converges and that $p > 1$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nLet the series be $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ and its partial sums be $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k^p}$. We are given the inequality for the odd-indexed partial sums:\n$$S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} \\quad \\text{for all } k \\geq 0$$\n\n1.  **Isolate the partial sum term.**\n    Rearranging the inequality, we get:\n    $$S_{2k+1} - 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} < 1$$\n    $$S_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$$\n\n2.  **Determine the condition on $p$.**\n    The terms of the series are positive, so the partial sums $S_{2k+1}$ are always positive. For the inequality to provide an upper bound on $S_{2k+1}$, the coefficient $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ must be positive. If it were zero or negative, the inequality would either be trivial ($0 < 1$) or would provide a lower bound, not the upper bound needed to prove convergence.\n    Therefore, we must have:\n    $$1 - 2^{1-p} > 0$$\n    $$1 > 2^{1-p}$$\n    Since $y=2^x$ is a strictly increasing function, we can compare the exponents:\n    $$0 > 1-p$$\n    $$p > 1$$\n\n3.  **Bound the partial sums.**\n    Now that we have established $p > 1$, we know that $1 - 2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant. We can divide the inequality by this constant without changing its direction:\n    $$S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$$\n    Let $M = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$. Since $p > 1$, $M$ is a finite positive constant. This shows that all odd-indexed partial sums are bounded above by $M$.\n\n    Now consider any partial sum $S_n$.\n    - If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$ for some $k$, and we have $S_n < M$.\n    - If $n$ is even, $n=2k$ for some $k$, we can use the fact that the terms $\\frac{1}{n^p}$ are positive, which makes the sequence of partial sums strictly increasing ($S_n < S_{n+1}$).\n      $$S_{2k} < S_{2k+1} < M$$\n    Thus, for any integer $n \\geq 1$, the partial sum $S_n$ is bounded above by $M$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem.**\n    The sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ has two properties:\n    - It is **monotonically increasing**, since $S_{n+1} = S_n + \\frac{1}{(n+1)^p}$ and $\\frac{1}{(n+1)^p} > 0$.\n    - It is **bounded above** by $M$.\n\n    By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, any sequence that is both monotonically increasing and bounded above must converge to a finite limit.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe given inequality implies that $p > 1$. For such values of $p$, the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded above, which proves that the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges.\n\nfinal:Let $p$ be a real number.

Rearranging the terms, we get $S_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$.\nSince the terms of the series are positive, the partial sums $S_{2k+1}$ are positive. To obtain a meaningful upper bound for $S_{2k+1}$ from this inequality, the coefficient $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ must be positive.\n$$1 - 2^{1-p} > 0 \\implies 1 > 2^{1-p} \\implies 2^0 > 2^{1-p}$$\nSince $y=2^x$ is a strictly increasing function, this implies $0 > 1-p$, which means $p > 1$.\n\nWith $p > 1$, we can divide by the positive constant $(1 - 2^{1-p})$ to find an upper bound for the odd partial sums:\n$$S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$$\nLet $M = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$. The sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is strictly increasing because all its terms are positive. For any even partial sum $S_{2k}$, we have $S_{2k} < S_{2k+1} < M$.
