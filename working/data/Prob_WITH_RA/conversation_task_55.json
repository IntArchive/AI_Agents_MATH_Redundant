This function is surjective because for any x ∈ U, there exists some n ∈ ℕ with x ∈ A_n, and since A_n is enumerated as {a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, ...}, there exists some m ∈ ℕ such that x = a_{n,m} = f(n,m).\\n\\n**Step 5: Use the countability of ℕ×ℕ.**\\nIt is a well-known fact that ℕ×ℕ is countable. There exists a bijection g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ (for example, the Cantor pairing function). The composition f∘g: ℕ → U is then a surjection from ℕ to U, because:\\n- g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ is bijective (hence surjective)\\n- f: ℕ×ℕ → U is surjective\\n- The composition of surjective functions is surjective.\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclude U is at most countable.**\\nThe existence of a surjection f∘g: ℕ → U shows that U is at most countable.

Then the union U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n is countable.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n**1. Formalize the Assumptions:**\nWe are given a countable collection of sets, {A_n}_{n∈ℕ}, indexed by the natural numbers. Each set A_n in this collection is countable. This means that for each n, there is a way to list its elements, i.e., we can enumerate them.\n\n**2. Enumerate Each Set:**\nSince each set A_n is countable, we can write its elements as a sequence (which may be finite or infinite):\nA_n = {a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, ...}\nFor any given n, this sequence contains all the elements of A_n.\n\n**3. Define the Union:**\nThe union of all these sets is U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n. An element `x` is in U if and only if `x` belongs to at least one of the sets A_n.\n\n**4. Construct a Surjection from ℕ×ℕ to U:**\nWe can arrange all the elements of U into an infinite grid:\n- Row 1: a_{1,1}, a_{1,2}, a_{1,3}, ... (elements of A₁)\n- Row 2: a_{2,1}, a_{2,2}, a_{2,3}, ... (elements of A₂)\n- Row 3: a_{3,1}, a_{3,2}, a_{3,3}, ... (elements of A₃)\n- ...\n\nEvery element of U appears at least once in this grid. This arrangement defines a function `f: ℕ×ℕ → U` where `f(n, m) = a_{n,m}`. This function is a surjection (an onto function) because any element `x` in U must belong to some A_n, and if `x` is in A_n, it must be the m-th element in its enumeration for some `m`. Thus, `x = a_{n,m} = f(n,m)`.\n\n**5. Establish the Countability of ℕ×ℕ:**\nThe set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers, ℕ×ℕ, is known to be countable. This can be shown by traversing the grid of pairs diagonally (the Cantor pairing function provides a bijection `g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ`).\n\n**6. Conclude the Countability of U:**\nWe have a surjective function `f: ℕ×ℕ → U` and we know ℕ×ℕ is countable (meaning there is a bijection `g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ`, which is also a surjection). The composition of these two functions, `f∘g: ℕ → U`, is a surjection from the natural numbers to U.\n\nThe existence of a surjection from ℕ to U implies that the cardinality of U is no greater than the cardinality of ℕ, i.e., |U| ≤ |ℕ|. This means U is \"at most countable.\"\n\n**7. Final Conclusion:**\nA set is defined as countable if it is either finite or countably infinite.\n- If U is empty or finite, it is countable by definition.\n- If U is infinite, the condition |U| ≤ |ℕ| implies that U must be countably infinite.\n\nIn either case, U is countable. Therefore, the union of a countable number of countable sets is countable. ∎\n\nfinal:"

(diagonal enumeration), skipping any duplicates if needed. This gives a surjection from ℕ to U, proving U is countable.\n**Theorem:** Let {A_n}_{n∈ℕ} be a countable collection of sets, where each A_n is countable. Then the union U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n is countable.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Formalize the assumptions.**\nWe are given a countable collection of sets indexed by natural numbers: {A_n}_{n∈ℕ}. Each A_n is countable, meaning there exists an injection from A_n to ℕ (or equivalently, A_n can be enumerated as a sequence, possibly finite).\n\n**Step 2: Enumerate each countable set.**\nFor each n ∈ ℕ, since A_n is countable, we can write it as a sequence (allowing finite sequences if A_n is finite):\nA_n = {a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, ...}\nIf A_n is finite with k_n elements, we can still represent it as an infinite sequence by repeating the last element, or more formally, we can define a surjection from ℕ to A_n.\n\n**Step 3: Define the union.**\nLet U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n = {x : ∃ n ∈ ℕ such that x ∈ A_n}.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a surjection from ℕ×ℕ to U.**\nDefine a function f: ℕ×ℕ → U by f(n,m) = a_{n,m}, where a_{n,m} is the m-th element in the enumeration of A_n. This function is surjective because for any x ∈ U, there exists some n ∈ ℕ with x ∈ A_n, and since A_n is enumerated as {a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, ...}, there exists some m ∈ ℕ such that x = a_{n,m} = f(n,m).\n\n**Step 5: Use the countability of ℕ×ℕ.**\nIt is a well-known fact that ℕ×ℕ is countable. There exists a bijection g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ (for example, the Cantor pairing function). The composition f∘g: ℕ → U is then a surjection from ℕ to U, because:\n- g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ is bijective (hence surjective)\n- f: ℕ×ℕ → U is surjective\n- The composition of surjective functions is surjective.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude U is at most countable.**\nThe existence of a surjection f∘g: ℕ → U shows that U is at most countable. More precisely:\n- If U is finite, then it is countable by definition (finite sets are countable).\n- If U is infinite, the surjection shows |U| ≤ |ℕ|, so U is countably infinite.\n\n**Step 7: Handle the cardinality.**\nWe need to show U is actually countable (not just at most countable). There are two cases:\n1. If at least one A_n is infinite, then U contains an infinite subset, so U is infinite. Combined with |U| ≤ |ℕ| from Step 6, we conclude U is countably infinite.\n2. If all A_n are finite, then U is a countable union of finite sets. In this case, U could be finite or countably infinite. Either way, it is countable (since finite sets are countable by definition, and countably infinite sets are countable).\n\n**Alternative approach for completeness:**\nTo address potential concerns about the enumeration when some A_n are finite, we can use a more rigorous construction. For each n ∈ ℕ, since A_n is countable, there exists a surjection φ_n: ℕ → A_n (if A_n is finite, we can define φ_n to be constant on a tail). Then define ψ: ℕ×ℕ → U by ψ(n,k) = φ_n(k). This is clearly surjective. The rest of the proof proceeds as before.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that there exists a surjection from ℕ to U, which means U is at most countable. Since U is either finite or contains an infinite subset from some A_n, it is countable. Therefore, the union of countably many countable sets is countable. ∎",

Then the union U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n is countable.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n**1. Formalize the Assumptions:**\nWe are given a countable collection of sets, {A_n}_{n∈ℕ}, indexed by the natural numbers. Each set A_n in this collection is countable. This means that for each n, there is a way to list its elements, i.e., we can enumerate them.\n\n**2. Enumerate Each Set:**\nSince each set A_n is countable, we can write its elements as a sequence (which may be finite or infinite):\nA_n = {a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, ...}\nFor any given n, this sequence contains all the elements of A_n.\n\n**3. Define the Union:**\nThe union of all these sets is U = ∪_{n∈ℕ} A_n. An element `x` is in U if and only if `x` belongs to at least one of the sets A_n.\n\n**4. Construct a Surjection from ℕ×ℕ to U:**\nWe can arrange all the elements of U into an infinite grid:\n- Row 1: a_{1,1}, a_{1,2}, a_{1,3}, ... (elements of A₁)\n- Row 2: a_{2,1}, a_{2,2}, a_{2,3}, ... (elements of A₂)\n- Row 3: a_{3,1}, a_{3,2}, a_{3,3}, ... (elements of A₃)\n- ...\n\nEvery element of U appears at least once in this grid. This arrangement defines a function `f: ℕ×ℕ → U` where `f(n, m) = a_{n,m}`. This function is a surjection (an onto function) because any element `x` in U must belong to some A_n, and if `x` is in A_n, it must be the m-th element in its enumeration for some `m`. Thus, `x = a_{n,m} = f(n,m)`.\n\n**5. Establish the Countability of ℕ×ℕ:**\nThe set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers, ℕ×ℕ, is known to be countable. This can be shown by traversing the grid of pairs diagonally (the Cantor pairing function provides a bijection `g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ`).\n\n**6. Conclude the Countability of U:**\nWe have a surjective function `f: ℕ×ℕ → U` and we know ℕ×ℕ is countable (meaning there is a bijection `g: ℕ → ℕ×ℕ`, which is also a surjection). The composition of these two functions, `f∘g: ℕ → U`, is a surjection from the natural numbers to U.\n\nThe existence of a surjection from ℕ to U implies that the cardinality of U is no greater than the cardinality of ℕ, i.e., |U| ≤ |ℕ|. This means U is \"at most countable.\"\n\n**7. Final Conclusion:**\nA set is defined as countable if it is either finite or countably infinite.\n- If U is empty or finite, it is countable by definition.\n- If U is infinite, the condition |U| ≤ |ℕ| implies that U must be countably infinite.\n\nIn either case, U is countable. Therefore, the union of a countable number of countable sets is countable. ∎\n\nfinal:"
