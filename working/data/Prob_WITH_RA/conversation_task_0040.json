This is a well-known result from number theory: if √2 were rational, say √2 = p/q in lowest terms, then 2 = p²/q², so p² = 2q², implying p² is even, hence p is even. Write p = 2r, then 4r² = 2q², so q² = 2r², implying q² is even, hence q is even. But then p and q share a factor of 2, contradicting that p/q is in lowest terms. Therefore, √2 is irrational.\\n\\n**Step 2: Consider the number √2^√2**\\nDefine the number A = √2^√2. This number is well-defined since √2 > 0, and exponentiation of positive real numbers is well-defined. We do not know a priori whether A is rational or irrational. We will consider both possibilities.\\n\\n**Step 3: Case analysis**\\nWe perform a case analysis based on whether A is rational or irrational.\\n\\n**Case 1: Assume A = √2^√2 is rational.**\\nIf A is rational, then we can take:\\n- a = √2 (which is irrational by Step 1)\\n- b = √2 (also irrational by Step 1)\\nThen a^b = √2^√2 = A, which is rational by our assumption in this case. Thus, we have found irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\\n\\n**Case 2: Assume A = √2^√2 is irrational.**\\nIf A is irrational, then we can take:\\n- a = A = √2^√2 (irrational by assumption in this case)\\n- b = √2 (irrational by Step 1)\\nNow compute a^b:\\na^b = (√2^√2)^√2\\n\\nUsing the property of exponents that (x^y)^z = x^(y·z) for positive real numbers x, y, z, we have:\\n(√2^√2)^√2 = √2^(√2 × √2)\\n\\nSince √2 × √2 = (√2)² = 2, we obtain:\\n√2^(√2 × √2) = √2^2 = (√2)² = 2\\n\\nThus, a^b = 2, which is clearly rational (indeed, an integer).\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\\nIn Case 1, we found irrational a = √2 and b = √2 with a^b rational. In Case 2, we found irrational a = √2^√2 and b = √2 with a^b = 2 rational. Therefore, in either case, we have exhibited specific irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\\n\\n**Step 5: Final remark**\\nNote that this proof is non-constructive in the sense that we do not determine which case actually holds (i.e., we do not know whether √2^√2 is rational or irrational). However, the logical structure guarantees that one of the cases must be true, and in each case we have an explicit construction. It is known from the Gelfond-Schneider theorem that √2^√2 is actually transcendental (hence irrational), so Case 2 is the true case, giving a = √2^√2 and b = √2 as concrete examples of irrational numbers with a^b rational.\\n\\nThus, we have proven that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"
