The second integral can be computed in a similar way. Just take $f(x)=\\chi_{[-1,1]}(x)$ (the indicator function of the interval $[-1,1]$). Edit.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the original problem: The user is asking for a proof that the integral of (sin x \/ x)^2 from 0 to infinity equals pi\/2. The example provided in the question shows that the assumption included specific conditions on the variables or functions involved. However, in this integral problem, the main function is (sin x \/ x)^2, and the limits of integration are from 0 to infinity. \n\nI need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. But in this case, are there any explicit assumptions given? The original problem doesn't state any specific conditions beyond the integral itself. The function (sin x \/ x)^2 is defined for all x > 0, and the integral is improper at both 0 and infinity. However, typically for such integrals, we assume that the function is integrable over the interval, which might be an implicit assumption here. But since the problem is to prove the value of the integral, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral setup.\n\nWait, the example given in the instruction had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7. But in this integral problem, the original question doesn't specify any parameters or variables with conditions except the integral itself. So perhaps there are no additional assumptions here. But I need to make sure. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem is: Prove that the integral from 0 to infinity of (sin x \/ x)^2 dx equals pi\/2. The user mentions that the integral of sin x \/ x from 0 to infinity is also pi\/2, but that's just a related fact. The problem itself doesn't impose any restrictions beyond the integral. So maybe the assumptions are about the function being integrated, like it's integrable, or the integral converges. But since the problem is to prove the value, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral exists. However, in the example provided, the assumption was about the variable n. Here, the variable x is integrated over, so maybe there are no variables with conditions. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that the integral is over the positive real numbers, but that's already stated in the problem.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The example included assumptions on the variable n, but in this case, the problem is about an integral, and the variable x is integrated out. So perhaps there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral's limits and the function. But the format requires listing assumptions. Maybe the integral is an improper Riemann integral, so the assumptions would be related to that. For example, the function (sin x \/ x)^2 is continuous on (0, infinity), and the integral converges. But the problem is to prove the value, so maybe the existence is part of what needs to be proven, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the example given had the user include \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. In the original problem here, there are no such variables with conditions. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions to list here. But the format requires assumptions. Maybe the assumption is that the integral is in the Riemann sense, or that the integrand is defined as the limit as x approaches 0, since sin x \/ x approaches 1 at x=0. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2$ is integrable on $(0, \\infty)$,\nThe integral is interpreted as an improper Riemann integral.\n\nBut the problem statement already mentions the integral from 0 to infinity, which implies it's an improper integral. However, to adhere to the format, I need to list each assumption. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption that the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x \/ x)^2 is 1, ensuring the function is defined at 0. But that's a property of the function, not an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is just to compute the integral. However, the example provided included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them, but they were inferred. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems like the formatted problem added an extra assumption. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Because the original problem's assumption was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem restricted it to n divisible by 7. That might be an error in the example. But perhaps the user made a mistake there. Alternatively, maybe the example was from a different problem. Hmm, that's confusing. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", the assumption should just be \"n is an integer\", but the formatted example added an extra assumption. That suggests maybe the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow that format regardless.\n\nIn the current problem, the integral is from 0 to infinity of (sinx\/x)^2 dx. The assumptions would be about the integrand and the integral. But perhaps the user expects to list the function's properties as assumptions. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integrand $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2$ is defined for all $x > 0$,\nThe integral is an improper Riemann integral at both $x=0$ and $x=\\infty$.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions, and the problem is just to compute the integral. However, the format requires listing assumptions. In the example, even though the original problem didn't mention divisibility by 7, the formatted problem included it. Wait, no, looking back: the original example problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory because the original problem's statement was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an extra condition. That suggests that maybe there was a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different condition but was mistyped. Given that, maybe in the current problem, even if there are no explicit assumptions, I need to list the necessary ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't have any assumptions, and the user just needs to state the problem. But the format requires an assumption section. So perhaps in this case, the only assumption is the integral's existence, but that's part of what needs to be proven. Alternatively, the assumption is that the integral converges. But since the problem is to evaluate it, perhaps the assumption is that the integral exists as a real number. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 \\mathrm dx$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 \\mathrm dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no assumption needed, and the user just lists the problem. But the example had assumptions, so perhaps I need to include something. Wait, looking at the example again: the original problem was \"Prove that for every integer n...\", so the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect. Unless the original problem had a typo and was supposed to say \"for every integer n divisible by 7\", but the user made a mistake. So perhaps the example is flawed. In any case, following the user's instruction, even if the example seems off, I need to apply the same approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumption is that the integral is taken in the sense of the improper Riemann integral, and that the function is integrable. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the user just has to write the problem. But the format requires assumptions. Maybe in this case, there are no explicit assumptions, so the assumptions section is empty. But the example didn't have that. Alternatively, the problem is the integral itself, so the assumption is about the limits of integration and the integrand. For example:\n\nAssumption:\nThe lower limit of integration is 0,\nThe upper limit of integration is infinity,\nThe integrand is $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2$.\n\nBut those are part of the problem statement, not assumptions. Assumptions should be conditions or properties that are given to be true, not the problem's components. The example's assumptions were conditions on n. Here, there's no variable with conditions. Therefore, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the user should leave the assumption section blank. But the format requires it. Alternatively, the user might have intended that if there are no assumptions, just state the problem. However, based on the example, even if the original problem didn't have explicit assumptions beyond the variable being an integer, the formatted problem included that as an assumption. Therefore, following that pattern, perhaps in this integral problem, the assumptions are about the variable x, but since x is a dummy variable of integration, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the assumption is that the integral is convergent. But that's part of what needs to be proven. Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Given the example, even if it's flawed, I think the best approach is to list any relevant assumptions that are implicit. In this case, the integral is from 0 to infinity, which implies it's an improper integral. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is an improper Riemann integral,\nThe function $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2$ is integrable over $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nBut again, the integrability is part of what needs to be proven. So maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the only assumption is that the integral exists, and the problem is to compute its value. But I think in mathematical proofs, often the convergence is established as part of the solution. Therefore, maybe there are no assumptions here, and the problem is to evaluate the integral. However, since the format requires an assumption section, perhaps we list the function and the integral's nature. Alternatively, maybe the problem is as stated, and there are no assumptions, so we just put \"None\" or something, but the example didn't do that. Given the confusion, I think the safest bet is to follow the example's structure but apply it to this problem. The example had assumptions on the variable n, which was part of the original problem's universal quantifier. Here, since there are no variables with conditions, perhaps there are no assumptions. But the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them explicitly (other than n being an integer). Therefore, maybe in this case, the assumption is that the integral is over the interval [0, ∞), and the integrand is as given. But those are part of the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps there are no assumptions, and the problem is simply to prove the integral's value. However, the format requires an assumption section. Therefore, maybe the correct answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 \\mathrm dx$ converges.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 \\mathrm dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nBut this seems a bit forced. Alternatively, since the user's example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (assuming n divisible by 7 when the original problem said for every integer n), perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, given that, perhaps the correct approach is to list the components of the problem as assumptions. For example, the function is (sinx\/x)^2, the limits are 0 to infinity, etc. But that's part of the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe there are no assumptions, and the problem is just to evaluate the integral. But the example shows that even if the original problem had a universal quantifier, the assumptions were listed. So perhaps the answer is:\n\nAssumption:\nThe function $\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2$ is integrable on $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $\\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)^2 \\mathrm dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThis way, the assumption is that the integral exists, and the problem is to find its value. But in reality, proving convergence is part of the problem. However, following the example's lead, where the original problem had a universal quantifier but the formatted problem included specific assumptions, maybe it's acceptable.",

This definition is natural since lim_{x→0} (sin x\/x)² = 1. The function f is even, continuous on ℝ, and decays like 1\/x² as |x| → ∞, ensuring good integrability properties.\n\n**Step 2: Express the given sum in terms of f**\nFrom assumption (2), we have:\n∑_{n=1}^∞ f(n) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (sin n\/n)² = π\/2 - 1\/2.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Poisson summation formula**\nThe Poisson summation formula states that for a sufficiently nice function f (specifically, f and its Fourier transform should be in L¹ and satisfy certain decay conditions, which f satisfies due to its 1\/x² decay), we have:\n∑_{n=-∞}^∞ f(n) = ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ ẑf(2πk),\nwhere ẑf(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)e^{-iωx}dx is the Fourier transform of f.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the left-hand side**\nSince f is even, f(-n) = f(n) for n > 0, and f(0) = 1.

Thus, for all k ≠ 0, ẑf(2πk) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the sum on the right-hand side simplifies to a single term:\n∑_{k=-∞}^∞ ẑf(2πk) = ẑf(0) = π.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the Fourier transform to the integral**\nBy the definition of the Fourier transform, the value at ω = 0 is the integral of the function over its entire domain:\nẑf(0) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)e^{-i·0·x}dx = ∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)dx.\n\nSince f(x) is an even function, its integral from -∞ to ∞ is twice its integral from 0 to ∞:\n∫_{-∞}^∞ f(x)dx = 2∫_{0}^∞ f(x)dx = 2∫_{0}^∞ (sin x\/x)² dx.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the proof**\nFrom the Poisson summation formula, we equate our results from Step 3 and Step 4, though the key insight comes from relating Step 3 to Step 5.\nFrom Step 3, we found ∑_{n=-∞}^∞ f(n) = π.\nFrom the Poisson summation formula, this must be equal to ẑf(0).\nSo, ẑf(0) = π.\n\nUsing the result from Step 5:\n2∫_{0}^∞ (sin x\/x)² dx = ẑf(0) = π.\n\nDividing by 2, we arrive at the desired result:\n∫_{0}^∞ (sin x\/x)² dx = π\/2.\n\nfinal:"
