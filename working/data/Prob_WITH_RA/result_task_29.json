    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a given problem from Math Stack Exchange into their specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down the original problem into assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original question carefully. The problem is to prove that the rank of A transpose times A equals the rank of A for any matrix A in M_{m x n}. The user mentioned that the exercise is related to orthogonal projections and Gram-Schmidt, but the person asking the question is unsure how those are relevant.\n\nNow, the task is to structure this problem into Assumptions and Problem. The example given for the previous problem had assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. But in this case, the problem is general: for any matrix A in M_{m x n}. So the assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. \n\nThe problem states \"for any A in M_{m x n}\", so the assumptions should list the properties of A. Since the problem is about rank properties, perhaps the assumptions are about the matrix A being any real matrix (assuming entries are real, because if complex, A* instead of A^T might be used). But the problem as stated uses A^TA, so it's likely assuming real matrices. But the original problem didn't specify, so maybe we shouldn't assume that. Wait, the user's example didn't include assumptions not mentioned. The original problem just says \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\". So the key assumptions here are that A is an m×n matrix. But in the example, the assumption was \"n is an integer\". Here, the main condition is that A is an m×n matrix. So maybe the assumption here is just that A is an element of M_{m×n}, which is the set of m×n matrices. But the user's format says each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So the assumption is that A is a matrix in M_{m×n}, which is the space of m×n matrices. Since the problem is for any such matrix, that's the key condition.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption was \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". Wait, in that example, the user's formatted problem included an assumption that wasn't explicitly stated. Wait, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like a mistake. Wait, let me check again. The original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But the formatted problem in the example lists assumptions as \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". That seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", so the assumption should just be that n is an integer. But in the example, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might be part of the problem's actual conditions. Wait, maybe the original example was different. Let me check again.\n\nThe original example given by the user:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: \nn is an integer,\nn is divisible by 7.\nProblem: Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Unless perhaps the original problem was misrepresented. But maybe the user made a mistake in their example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but in the user's example, they wrote \"for every integer n\". That would be a problem. But perhaps the example is incorrect. Anyway, the user is providing their own example, so we need to follow their format even if the example is inconsistent.\n\nBut in our current problem, the original problem is to prove rank(A^T A) = rank(A) for any A ∈ M_{m×n}. So according to the user's example, we need to list the assumptions. The problem says \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\". So the assumption here is that A is an m×n matrix. But in the user's example, they split the assumptions into separate lines. So in this case, the only assumption is that A is in M_{m×n}. However, sometimes when dealing with rank properties, we might need to assume that the entries are real numbers, because if they're complex, the transpose might need to be conjugate transpose. But the problem as stated uses A^T, which is transpose, not conjugate transpose. So perhaps the assumption is that A is a real matrix. But the original problem didn't specify. Wait, M_{m×n} usually denotes matrices over a field, typically real unless specified. But the problem didn't mention. So maybe the user expects the assumption to be that A is a real matrix. However, in the original problem statement, the user just wrote \"any A ∈ M_{m×n}\", so maybe the assumption is just that A is an element of M_{m×n}, which is the set of m×n matrices, without specifying the field. But perhaps in the context of the textbook, they're working over the real numbers. But since it's not specified, maybe we shouldn't include that. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes real matrices. \n\nBut the user's example added an assumption that wasn't present in the original problem. Wait, in their example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, they added \"n is divisible by 7\", which is incorrect. That suggests that maybe the user's example is wrong, and perhaps the correct approach is to list all conditions given in the problem as assumptions. So in the current problem, the only condition is that A is in M_{m×n}. Therefore, the assumption is \"A is an m×n matrix\". But the problem is to prove rank(A^T A) = rank(A). So the problem statement is as given. Therefore, the formatted problem should have assumption: A is an m×n matrix. Then problem: Prove that rank(A^T A) = rank A.\n\nBut the user's example had two assumptions even though the original problem only mentioned one condition. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Let's check again:\n\nOriginal problem in example: Prove that for every integer $n$, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the only assumption should be that n is an integer. The fact that it's divisible by 91 might not be an assumption but part of the conclusion. But in the formatted problem, the user included \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which is not in the original problem. This suggests that maybe the user's example is incorrect, perhaps from a different problem. But regardless, I need to follow the user's instruction. However, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n was supposed to be divisible by 7. But given that confusion, perhaps in the current problem, we should stick to the original problem's conditions.\n\nSo for the current problem: \"Prove rank A^T A = rank A for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\". The assumption here is that A is an m×n matrix. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: A is an m×n matrix.\n\nProblem: Prove that rank A^T A = rank A.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the user split the assumptions into two lines even when they could be combined. For instance, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are two separate assumptions. Similarly, here, perhaps the assumption is that A is a matrix, and m and n are integers, but the problem states \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\", so the key assumption is that A is in that set. But according to the user's example, each assumption should address one property applied to one object. So \"A is an m×n matrix\" is one assumption. But perhaps m and n are positive integers? Are there any other assumptions?\n\nWait, the problem says \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\", which is the space of m×n matrices. So the assumption is that A is such a matrix. The user's example had \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So in this case, the assumption is that A is an m×n matrix. Since m and n are dimensions, they are positive integers, but the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps we shouldn't include that unless stated. The original problem doesn't mention m and n being integers, but since they are dimensions, they have to be positive integers. However, the problem says \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\", so the assumption is just about A. Therefore, the assumption is:\n\nA is an element of M_{m×n} (i.e., A is an m×n matrix).\n\nThus, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an m×n matrix.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the rank of A^T A is equal to the rank of A.\n\nAlternatively, in LaTeX:\n\nProblem: Prove that $\\operatorname{rank}A^TA=\\operatorname{rank}A$ for any $A\\in M_{m \\times n}$.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem statement is written as \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So in this case, the problem statement would be \"Prove that rank A^T A = rank A.\"\n\nBut the original problem already states \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\", so perhaps in the formatted problem, we can omit \"for any A ∈ M_{m×n}\" since it's covered in the assumption. The example did that: the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption is \"n is an integer\" and the problem is \"Prove that A(n)... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo applying that here, the assumption is \"A is an m×n matrix\" and the problem is \"Prove that rank A^T A = rank A.\"\n\nI think that's the correct structure. The key is to separate the conditions into assumptions and then state the problem. The original problem's conditions are that A is an m×n matrix, so that's the assumption. The problem is to prove the equality of the ranks.",

The result then follows from the rank-nullity theorem.\n\n1.  **Show N(A) ⊆ N(A^TA):**\n    Let **x** be a vector in N(A).
