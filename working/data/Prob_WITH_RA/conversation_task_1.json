Let $A$ be the point $(1,0)$ on the circle. For an angle $x$ such that $0 < x < \\pi/2$, let $P$ be the point on the circle such that the angle $\\angle AOP = x$ radians, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\n**Step 2: Construct additional points**\nDraw a line tangent to the circle at point $A$. This line is perpendicular to the radius $OA$. Extend the radius $OP$ until it intersects this tangent line at a point $T$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify coordinates and lengths**\nBased on the unit circle and trigonometric definitions:\n- The coordinates of the points are $O=(0,0)$, $A=(1,0)$, and $P=(\\cos x, \\sin x)$.\n- The line tangent to the circle at $A(1,0)$ is the vertical line $x=1$.\n- The line passing through $O$ and $P$ has the equation $y = (\\tan x)x$.\n- The point $T$ is the intersection of the line $OP$ and the tangent line at $A$. Substituting $x=1$ into the equation for line $OP$ gives $y = \\tan x$. Thus, the coordinates of $T$ are $(1, \\tan x)$.\n- The lengths of the relevant segments are $OA=1$, the height of $P$ above the x-axis is $\\sin x$, and the length of the segment $AT$ is $\\tan x$.\n\n**Step 4: Define and calculate the areas of three geometric figures**\n1.  **Area of Triangle OAP**: This triangle has base $OA$ of length 1 and a height equal to the y-coordinate of $P$, which is $\\sin x$.\n    Area($\\triangle OAP$) = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times \\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin x$.\n\n2.  **Area of Circular Sector OAP**: This is the sector of the unit circle defined by the angle $x$ (in radians).\n    Area(Sector $OAP$) = $\\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} (1)^2 x = \\frac{1}{2}x$.\n\n3.  **Area of Triangle OAT**: This is a right-angled triangle with base $OA$ of length 1 and height $AT$ of length $\\tan x$.\n    Area($\\triangle OAT$) = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times \\tan x = \\frac{1}{2}\\tan x$.\n\n**Step 5: Establish the relationship between the areas**\nFor any angle $x$ in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$, we can see from the geometric construction that triangle $OAP$ is contained within the circular sector $OAP$, which in turn is contained within the triangle $OAT$.\nThis geometric containment implies an inequality of their respective areas:\nArea($\\triangle OAP$) $\\le$ Area(Sector $OAP$) $\\le$ Area($\\triangle OAT$)\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the area formulas into the inequality**\nSubstituting the expressions for the areas calculated in Step 4, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sin x \\le \\frac{1}{2}x \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\tan x\n$$\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the proof**\nThe inequality derived in the previous step, when reordered, is the inequality we sought to prove:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\tan(x) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}x \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(x)\n$$\nThis holds for all $x \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.
