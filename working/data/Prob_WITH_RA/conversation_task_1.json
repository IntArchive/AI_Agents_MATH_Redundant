The inequality: 1/2 tan(x) ≥ 1/2 x ≥ 1/2 sin(x)\n\nWe need to prove that any valid proof of lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 using these assumptions must employ geometric reasoning.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the constraints**\nAssumption 3 prohibits the use of Taylor series expansions. This eliminates the standard analytic approach where we would expand sin(x) as x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - ... and then compute sin(x)/x = 1 - x²/3! + x⁴/5! - ... → 1 as x → 0.\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the inequality**\nThe inequality in assumption 4 can be simplified by multiplying all terms by 2:\ntan(x) ≥ x ≥ sin(x) for x > 0\n\nThis inequality is not an algebraic identity that can be derived purely from algebraic manipulation of trigonometric identities. It represents a fundamental relationship between these trigonometric functions.\n\n**Step 3: Geometric origin of the inequality**\nConsider the unit circle (radius = 1) centered at the origin O. For an angle x (0 < x < π/2), let:\n- Point A = (cos x, sin x) on the unit circle\n- Point B = (1, 0) on the x-axis\n- Point C = (1, tan x) on the vertical line through B\n\nNow consider the following areas in the first quadrant:\n1. Triangle OAB: vertices at O(0,0), A(cos x, sin x), B(1,0)\n   Area = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 1 × sin x = 1/2 sin(x)\n\n2. Circular sector OAB: portion of the unit circle from angle 0 to x\n   Area = (x/2π) × π(1)² = x/2 = 1/2 x\n\n3. Triangle OAC: vertices at O(0,0), A(cos x, sin x), C(1, tan x)\n   Area = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 1 × tan x = 1/2 tan(x)\n\n**Step 4: Geometric containment relationship**\nVisually, we can see that:\nTriangle OAB ⊆ Sector OAB ⊆ Triangle OAC\n\nThis geometric containment implies that their areas satisfy:\nArea(Triangle OAB) ≤ Area(Sector OAB) ≤ Area(Triangle OAC)\n\nSubstituting the area formulas:\n1/2 sin(x) ≤ 1/2 x ≤ 1/2 tan(x)\n\nMultiplying by 2 gives the inequality from assumption 4:\nsin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x) for 0 < x < π/2\n\n**Step 5: Deriving the limit using the inequality**\nFor x > 0, we have:\nsin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x)\n\nDividing by sin(x) > 0 (for 0 < x < π/2):\n1 ≤ x/sin(x) ≤ tan(x)/sin(x) = 1/cos(x)\n\nTaking reciprocals (which reverses inequalities):\n1 ≥ sin(x)/x ≥ cos(x)\n\nThus we have:\ncos(x) ≤ sin(x)/x ≤ 1 for 0 < x < π/2\n\n**Step 6: Applying the squeeze theorem**\nWe know that lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1 (this can be established from the continuity of cosine or from basic geometric properties).\n\nBy the squeeze theorem:\nSince cos(x) ≤ sin(x)/x ≤ 1 for 0 < x < π/2\nand lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1\nand lim_{x→0} 1 = 1\nit follows that lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1\n\n**Step 7: Necessity of geometric reasoning**\nThe key inequality sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x) for x > 0, which is equivalent to assumption 4, is fundamentally geometric in origin. It arises from comparing areas of geometric figures in the unit circle:\n- The triangle with vertices (0,0), (cos x, sin x), (1,0) has area 1/2 sin(x)\n- The circular sector from angle 0 to x has area 1/2 x\n- The triangle with vertices (0,0), (cos x, sin x), (1, tan x) has area 1/2 tan(x)\n\nThe containment relationship Triangle ⊆ Sector ⊆ Larger Triangle gives the inequality.\n\nWithout this geometric insight, there is no purely algebraic way to establish the inequality sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x) for x > 0 using only basic trigonometric identities. The inequality is not an algebraic identity but a geometric comparison.\n\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\nAny proof of lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 that uses the inequality from assumption 4 must implicitly or explicitly rely on the geometric reasoning that establishes this inequality. The inequality itself comes from comparing areas in the unit circle, which is a geometric argument. Therefore, given assumptions 1-4, any valid proof of the limit must employ geometric reasoning.\n\n∎",

No Taylor series expansions, 4. The inequality: `1/2 tan(x) ≥ 1/2 x ≥ 1/2 sin(x)`) must employ geometric reasoning.\n\n**Proof:**\nThe provided proof is correct. The argument hinges on the nature of the given inequality: `1/2 tan(x) ≥ 1/2 x ≥ 1/2 sin(x)`.\n\n1.  **Exclusion of Analytic Methods:** The prohibition of Taylor series (Assumption 3) removes the standard analytic proof, forcing reliance on other methods, such as the Squeeze Theorem.\n\n2.  **The Role of the Inequality:** The Squeeze Theorem proof for this limit depends entirely on establishing the bounds `cos(x) ≤ sin(x)/x ≤ 1`. These bounds are derived directly from the given inequality `sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x)` (a simplified form of Assumption 4).\n\n3.  **Geometric Origin of the Inequality:** The crucial insight is that the inequality `sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x)` is not an algebraic identity. Its proof is fundamentally geometric, established by comparing the areas of three shapes within the unit circle for an angle `x`:\n    *   Area of inner triangle: `1/2 sin(x)`\n    *   Area of circular sector: `1/2 x`\n    *   Area of outer triangle: `1/2 tan(x)`\n\n    The physical containment of these shapes (`inner triangle ⊆ sector ⊆ outer triangle`) directly leads to the inequality of their areas.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the proof of the limit requires the inequality, and the proof of the inequality requires a geometric argument, any proof of the limit under the given assumptions must necessarily employ geometric reasoning.\n\nfinal:The proof is correct."
