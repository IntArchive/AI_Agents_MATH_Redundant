This means we can write p(λ) = c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ), where λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ are the eigenvalues of A counted with their algebraic multiplicities, and c is a constant.\\n\\n**Step 1: Determining the constant c**\\nThe characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n in λ. Expanding the determinant, the leading term comes from the product of the diagonal entries of A - λI: det(A - λI) = (-1)^n λ^n + lower degree terms. This is because each diagonal entry contributes a factor of -λ, and there are n such factors.\\n\\nNow consider the factored form c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ). Expanding this product, the leading term is cλ^n. Comparing the leading coefficients of both expressions: cλ^n = (-1)^n λ^n, thus c = (-1)^n.\\n\\n**Step 2: First equivalent form**\\nSubstituting c = (-1)^n into the factored form, we obtain the first equivalent form:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)  (Form 1)\\n\\n**Step 3: Algebraic manipulation to obtain the second form**\\nFor each factor (λ - λ_i), we can rewrite it as: λ - λ_i = -1·(λ_i - λ). This is a simple algebraic identity: λ - λ_i = -(λ_i - λ).\\n\\nSubstituting this into Form 1:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n [(-1)(λ₁ - λ)][(-1)(λ₂ - λ)]⋯[(-1)(λₙ - λ)]\\n\\nNow we have n factors of (-1) from rewriting each (λ - λ_i) as -1·(λ_i - λ), plus the original factor (-1)^n. Grouping all the (-1) factors together:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n·(-1)^n·(λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\\n\\n**Step 4: Simplifying the sign factor**\\nSince (-1)^n·(-1)^n = (-1)^{2n} = [(-1)^2]^n = 1^n = 1, the sign factor simplifies to 1. Therefore:\\np(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)  (Form 3)\\n\\n**Step 5: Explicit intermediate form**\\nTo see the intermediate step explicitly, we can write:\\np(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)  (Form 2)\\nThis is exactly the expression we had before simplifying the sign factors. Form 2 shows each factor (λ - λ_i) multiplied by (-1), with the understanding that there are n such (-1) factors.\\n\\n**Verification of equivalence:**\\n1. **Form 1 → Form 2:** Multiply each factor (λ - λ_i) in Form 1 by (-1) and adjust the overall sign factor accordingly. Since we have n such multiplications, we effectively multiply by (-1)^n, which cancels the original (-1)^n factor, giving Form 2.\\n2. **Form 2 → Form 3:** In Form 2, each factor (-1)(λ - λ_i) = (λ_i - λ). Multiplying all n such factors gives (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ), which is Form 3.\\n3. **Form 3 → Form 1:** Starting from Form 3, we can write each factor (λ_i - λ) = -1·(λ - λ_i). Multiplying all n such factors gives (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ), which is Form 1.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** We have shown that under the assumption that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, the three forms are algebraically equivalent:\\n1. p(λ) = (-1)^n(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\\n2. p(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\\n3. p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\\nAll three expressions represent the same polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI), differing only in the arrangement of factors and sign conventions.\"\n}\n```"

The term of highest degree, λⁿ, arises from the product of the diagonal entries of the matrix (A - λI):\n    (a₁₁ - λ)(a₂₂ - λ)⋯(aₙₙ - λ) = (-λ)ⁿ + terms of lower degree = (-1)ⁿλⁿ + ...\n    Since the characteristic polynomial splits, it can be written in factored form as p(λ) = c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ), where c is a constant. Expanding this product gives cλⁿ as the leading term. By comparing the leading coefficients of both expressions for p(λ), we find that c = (-1)ⁿ.\n    This establishes the first form:\n    **p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)** (Form 1)\n\n2.  **Deriving the other forms:** We can rewrite each factor (λ - λᵢ) as -(λᵢ - λ), which is equivalent to (-1)(λᵢ - λ). Let's start from Form 1 and substitute this relationship.\n\n    *   **From Form 1 to Form 3:**\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ [(-1)(λ₁ - λ)][(-1)(λ₂ - λ)]⋯[(-1)(λₙ - λ)]\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ (-1)ⁿ (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        p(λ) = (-1)²ⁿ (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        Since (-1)²ⁿ = ((-1)²)ⁿ = 1ⁿ = 1, we get:\n        **p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)** (Form 3)\n\n    *   **Equivalence of Form 2:** Let's examine Form 2:\n        p(λ) = [(-1)(λ - λ₁)][(-1)(λ - λ₂)]⋯[(-1)(λ - λₙ)]\n        By grouping the (-1) terms, we have n of them:\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n        This is identical to Form 1.\n        Alternatively, we can distribute each (-1) into its corresponding parenthesis:\n        p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        This is identical to Form 3.\n\nThus, all three forms are algebraically equivalent representations of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nfinal:Show that for an n×n matrix A whose characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, with eigenvalues λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ counted with algebraic multiplicities, the characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) can be written in three equivalent forms:\n1. p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n2. p(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\n3. p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n\n**Proof:**\nThe characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n. The leading term, which comes from the product of the diagonal entries of (A - λI), is (-1)ⁿλⁿ.\n\nBy the assumption that the polynomial splits, we can write it as p(λ) = c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ) for some constant c. The leading term of this expanded form is cλⁿ. Comparing the leading coefficients, we must have c = (-1)ⁿ. This gives the first form:\np(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)  (Form 1)\n\nNow we show the equivalence of the other forms through algebraic manipulation.\nConsider Form 3:\n(λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n= [(-1)(λ - λ₁)][(-1)(λ - λ₂)]⋯[(-1)(λ - λₙ)]\n= (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\nThis is exactly Form 1.\n\nConsider Form 2:\n(-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\nThis is a product of n terms of the form [(-1)(λ - λᵢ)].

Expanding the determinant, the leading term comes from the product of the diagonal entries of A - λI: det(A - λI) = (-1)^n λ^n + lower degree terms. This is because each diagonal entry contributes a factor of -λ, and there are n such factors.\\n\\nNow consider the factored form c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ). Expanding this product, the leading term is cλ^n. Comparing the leading coefficients of both expressions: cλ^n = (-1)^n λ^n, thus c = (-1)^n.\\n\\n**Step 2: First equivalent form**\\nSubstituting c = (-1)^n into the factored form, we obtain the first equivalent form:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)  (Form 1)\\n\\n**Step 3: Algebraic manipulation to obtain the second form**\\nFor each factor (λ - λ_i), we can rewrite it as: λ - λ_i = -1·(λ_i - λ). This is a simple algebraic identity: λ - λ_i = -(λ_i - λ).\\n\\nSubstituting this into Form 1:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n [(-1)(λ₁ - λ)][(-1)(λ₂ - λ)]⋯[(-1)(λₙ - λ)]\\n\\nNow we have n factors of (-1) from rewriting each (λ - λ_i) as -1·(λ_i - λ), plus the original factor (-1)^n. Grouping all the (-1) factors together:\\np(λ) = (-1)^n·(-1)^n·(λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\\n\\n**Step 4: Simplifying the sign factor**\\nSince (-1)^n·(-1)^n = (-1)^{2n} = [(-1)^2]^n = 1^n = 1, the sign factor simplifies to 1. Therefore:\\np(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)  (Form 3)\\n\\n**Step 5: Explicit intermediate form**\\nTo see the intermediate step explicitly, we can write:\\np(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)  (Form 2)\\nThis is exactly the expression we had before simplifying the sign factors. Form 2 shows each factor (λ - λ_i) multiplied by (-1), with the understanding that there are n such (-1) factors.\\n\\n**Verification of equivalence:**\\n1. **Form 1 → Form 2:** Multiply each factor (λ - λ_i) in Form 1 by (-1) and adjust the overall sign factor accordingly. Since we have n such multiplications, we effectively multiply by (-1)^n, which cancels the original (-1)^n factor, giving Form 2.\\n2. **Form 2 → Form 3:** In Form 2, each factor (-1)(λ - λ_i) = (λ_i - λ). Multiplying all n such factors gives (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ), which is Form 3.\\n3. **Form 3 → Form 1:** Starting from Form 3, we can write each factor (λ_i - λ) = -1·(λ - λ_i). Multiplying all n such factors gives (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ), which is Form 1.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** We have shown that under the assumption that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, the three forms are algebraically equivalent:\\n1. p(λ) = (-1)^n(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\\n2. p(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\\n3. p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\\nAll three expressions represent the same polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI), differing only in the arrangement of factors and sign conventions.\"\n}\n```"
