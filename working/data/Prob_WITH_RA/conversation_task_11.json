More precisely, there exists a vector space isomorphism φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ defined by:\\n   φ(r) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ) where r = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ.\\n   This isomorphism is bijective (one-to-one and onto) and preserves the vector space structure.\\n\\n4. **Cardinality of ℚⁿ:** The set ℚ of rational numbers is countable.
