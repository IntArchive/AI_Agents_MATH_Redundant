    "Content":"A famous exercise which one encounters while doing Complex Analysis (Residue theory) is to prove that the given integral: $$\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x} x \\,\\mathrm  dx = \\frac \\pi 2$$ Well, can anyone prove this without using Residue theory?  I actually thought of using the series representation of $\\sin x$ : $$\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x} x \\, dx = \\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\int\\limits_0^n \\frac{1}{t} \\left( t - \\frac{t^3}{3!} + \\frac{t^5}{5!} + \\cdots \\right) \\,\\mathrm  dt$$ but I don't see how $\\pi$ comes here, since we need the answer to be equal to $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's another way of finishing off Derek's argument. He proves\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin(2n+1)x}{\\sin x}dx=\\frac\\pi2.$$\nLet\n$$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin(2n+1)x}{x}dx=\n\\int_0^{(2n+1)\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx.$$\nLet\n$$D_n=\\frac\\pi2-I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}f(x)\\sin(2n+1)x\\ dx$$\nwhere\n$$f(x)=\\frac1{\\sin x}-\\frac1x.$$\nWe need the fact that if we define $f(0)=0$ then $f$ has a continuous\nderivative on the interval $[0,\\pi\/2]$. Integration by parts yields\n$$D_n=\\frac1{2n+1}\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}f'(x)\\cos(2n+1)x\\ dx=O(1\/n).$$\nHence $I_n\\to\\pi\/2$ and we conclude that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}I_n=\\frac\\pi2.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem is about evaluating the integral of sin(x)\/x from 0 to infinity being equal to pi\/2 without using residue theory. The user mentioned trying to use the series representation of sin(x) but not seeing how pi comes into play.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the question for assumptions.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity. The function is sin(x)\/x. The user wants to prove the result without residue theory. They tried expanding sin(x) as its Taylor series. The problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's pi\/2. The original question also mentions that this is a famous exercise in complex analysis, but the user wants an alternative method.\n\nSo assumptions here would include things like the integral is over [0, ∞), the integrand is sin(x)\/x, and perhaps the restriction to not use residue theory. Also, the approach using the series expansion was attempted. Wait, but in the example given, assumptions were about the variables or conditions on the problem's objects. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this integral problem, maybe the assumptions are more about the function and the integral's limits. Let me structure them.\n\nAssumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n- The problem requires evaluation without using residue theory.\n- The series representation of sin x is considered.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, both about n. Here, the problem is to evaluate the integral, so perhaps the key assumptions are the limits of integration and the integrand. The method restriction (no residue theory) is part of the problem statement. Wait, the example includes \"Prove that... is divisible by 91\" and the assumptions are about n being integer and divisible by 7. So the problem includes the divisibility by 91, and the assumptions are the conditions on n.\n\nSimilarly, here the problem is to evaluate the integral as pi\/2, and the assumptions would be the integral's domain and the function. But the question also mentions not using residue theory. Should that be an assumption? In the example, the assumption was about n's properties, which are part of the problem's hypothesis. The method restriction might be part of the problem's constraints but not an assumption per se. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo perhaps the method restriction (no residue theory) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Assumptions are about the mathematical conditions given in the problem. So in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The integral is over the interval from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to evaluate that specific integral. So maybe the problem is just \"Evaluate the integral ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx\" with the answer being pi\/2. But the original question includes the user's attempt using the series expansion. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the integral is given as ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx, the assumptions would be the integral's limits and the integrand. The method restriction (without residue theory) is part of the problem's requirement, so it should be in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\nThe integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx equals π\/2 without using residue theory.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement included \"Prove that...\" with the expression. So here, the problem is to evaluate the integral, and the answer is known (pi\/2), so the problem is to prove that it's equal to pi\/2. The original question says \"Evaluating the integral... = pi\/2?\" So the problem is to show the integral equals pi\/2, and the user wants to do it without residue theory. The assumptions are the integral's domain and integrand.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval from 0 to ∞.\nThe integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx = π\/2 without using residue theory.\n\nThat seems to fit. The example's assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, each on separate lines. Here, the two main assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. The problem statement includes the task and the restriction on method. The user's attempt with the series is part of their approach, not an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nYes, that should be correct. So the formatted problem would list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"no\nWe need to analyze whether any of the three given assumptions is redundant in proving that ∫₀^∞ sin(x)\/x dx = π\/2.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Assumption 1**\nThe domain [0, ∞) is essential because:\n1. The integral ∫₀^∞ sin(x)\/x dx is an improper integral that requires careful treatment at both endpoints.\n2. At x = 0, the integrand sin(x)\/x has a removable singularity (limit as x→0 is 1).\n3. At x → ∞, the integral converges conditionally but not absolutely, requiring special techniques like Dirichlet's test.\n4. Without specifying the domain as [0, ∞), we cannot properly define the improper integral we're trying to evaluate.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Assumption 2**\nThe integrand sin(x)\/x is necessary because:\n1. This is the specific function we're integrating to obtain the result π\/2.\n2. Different integrands would yield different results (e.g., ∫₀^∞ cos(x)\/x dx diverges).\n3. The oscillatory nature of sin(x) combined with the 1\/x decay is crucial for the conditional convergence.\n4. Without specifying the integrand, we have no function to integrate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Assumption 3**\nThe equality I_n = ∫₀^{π\/2} sin((2n+1)x)\/x dx = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(x)\/x dx is mathematically provable via substitution, but it is not redundant because:\n1. **Mathematical proof of assumption 3**: Let u = (2n+1)x. Then du = (2n+1)dx, and when x = 0, u = 0; when x = π\/2, u = (2n+1)π\/2. The integral becomes:\n   ∫₀^{π\/2} sin((2n+1)x)\/x dx = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(u)\/[u\/(2n+1)] · [du\/(2n+1)] = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(u)\/u du.\n   This shows the equality is mathematically valid.\n\n2. **Why it's not redundant**: While mathematically provable, assumption 3 cannot be deduced from assumptions 1 and 2 alone because:\n   - Assumptions 1 and 2 only specify the domain and integrand for the original integral.\n   - Assumption 3 introduces a family of related integrals I_n with parameter n.\n   - The connection between these integrals and the original integral is not obvious from assumptions 1 and 2.\n   - In the intended proof strategy (often using the Dirichlet kernel or Fejér's method), this relationship is crucial for establishing convergence properties.\n\n3. **Role in the proof**: The sequence I_n plays a key role in many proofs of ∫₀^∞ sin(x)\/x dx = π\/2. Typically, one shows that:\n   - lim_{n→∞} I_n = ∫₀^∞ sin(x)\/x dx\n   - I_n = ∫₀^{π\/2} [sin((2n+1)x)]\/x dx = π\/2 (using properties of the Dirichlet kernel)\n   - Combining these gives the desired result.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion on redundancy**\nNo assumption is redundant:\n1. Assumption 1 is necessary to define the improper integral.\n2. Assumption 2 is necessary to specify the integrand.\n3. Assumption 3, while mathematically provable once stated, is not deducible from assumptions 1 and 2 alone and is essential for the intended proof approach.\n\nAll three assumptions are independent and necessary for the proof strategy that uses the sequence I_n to evaluate the improper integral. The fact that assumption 3 can be proven mathematically doesn't make it redundant in the context of the given assumptions, as it provides crucial structure for the proof that cannot be inferred from the first two assumptions.",
    "final reviewer":"```json\n{\n  \"proof_review\": false,\n  \"end_of_proof\": \"not final:\"\n}\n```\nThe provided proof incorrectly concludes that no assumption is redundant. The analysis of assumptions 1 and 2 is correct, as they are essential for defining the problem. However, the analysis of assumption 3 is flawed.\n\nThe proof correctly shows that assumption 3, the equality `∫₀^{π\/2} sin((2n+1)x)\/x dx = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(x)\/x dx`, is a mathematically provable identity using a simple u-substitution. A statement that can be derived from the fundamental principles of calculus is a theorem or lemma, not a necessary assumption. An assumption is a premise that is accepted without proof for the context of the problem. Since this statement can be proven, it is redundant to assume it. The argument that it is \"essential for the intended proof approach\" mistakes a useful step in a proof for a necessary foundational assumption.\n\nHere is the corrected analysis and final result.\n\n**Corrected Analysis**\n\n1.  **Assumption 1: The domain of integration is [0, ∞).** This is **not redundant**. The value of a definite or improper integral depends critically on its domain. Changing the domain would change the problem entirely.\n\n2.  **Assumption 2: The integrand is sin(x)\/x.** This is **not redundant**. This is the specific function being integrated. Any change to the integrand would lead to a different problem and a different result.\n\n3.  **Assumption 3: For any non-negative integer n, I_n = ∫₀^{π\/2} sin((2n+1)x)\/x dx = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(x)\/x dx.** This is **redundant**. As demonstrated in the provided proof itself, this equality can be proven directly using the substitution u = (2n+1)x. Since it is a provable mathematical fact derived from the principles of calculus, it does not need to be stated as an assumption. It is a lemma that can be established as a step in the overall proof of the integral's value, not a required premise to begin the problem.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAssumption (3) is redundant because it is a provable identity within the standard framework of integral calculus.\n\n**Original Problem without Redundant Assumption**\n\nGiven the problem of evaluating the improper integral ∫₀^∞ sin(x)\/x dx = π\/2, with the domain of integration [0, ∞) and the integrand sin(x)\/x.\n\nfinal:Assumption (3), `For any non-negative integer n, I_n = ∫₀^{π\/2} sin((2n+1)x)\/x dx = ∫₀^{(2n+1)π\/2} sin(x)\/x dx`, is redundant."
