    "Content":"What is the most unusual proof you know that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational? Here is my favorite: Theorem:  $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Proof:\n  $3^2-2\\cdot 2^2 = 1$. (That's it) That is a corollary of\nthis result: Theorem:\n  If $n$ is a positive integer\n  and there are positive integers\n  $x$ and $y$ such that\n  $x^2-ny^2 = 1$,\n  then\n  $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational.

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the given format. The original question is asking for the most unusual proof that √2 is irrational, and the user presents a specific proof involving Pell's equation. The task is to extract the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the assumptions. The main theorem mentioned is that if there exist positive integers x, y, and n such that x² - ny² = 1, then √n is irrational. The example given is 3² - 2*2² = 1, leading to √2 being irrational.\n\nLooking at the proof, there are two lemmas. Part 1 assumes that if x² - ny² = 1, then there are arbitrarily large solutions. Part 2 shows that if √n is rational (a\/b), then x must be less than b. These two parts contradict each other because Part 1 implies infinitely large x, while Part 2 restricts x to be less than b.\n\nThe key assumptions here are:\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - ny² = 1.\n3. √n can be expressed as a fraction a\/b where a and b are positive integers (for the sake of contradiction).\n4. The identity used in Part 1: (x² + ny²)² - n(2xy)² = (x² - ny²)².\n5. The inequality derived in Part 2 leading to x < b.\n\nBut according to the example provided, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the problem step by step.\n\nThe main theorem to prove is that √n is irrational under the given conditions. The problem statement is to prove that √2 is irrational using this theorem, given that 3² - 2*2² = 1. However, the user's example structures the problem as the theorem itself, not the specific case for √2. Wait, the original problem in the example was structured with assumptions and the problem. Here, the user is presenting a proof that uses the theorem. But the actual problem to structure is the theorem's proof, right?\n\nWait, the original question is asking for unusual proofs of √2 being irrational, and the answer provided is a specific method. The problem presented here is the theorem: If n is a positive integer and there exist positive integers x and y such that x² - ny² = 1, then √n is irrational. Then, using that theorem with the example n=2 (since 3² - 2*2²=1), you conclude √2 is irrational.\n\nSo the problem to structure is the theorem itself. Let's check the assumptions for that theorem.\n\nThe theorem's assumptions are:\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - ny² = 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that √n is irrational under these assumptions.\n\nBut in the example given in the user's message, they had an assumption that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. So in this case, the assumptions are n is a positive integer, and there exist x and y positive integers satisfying x² - ny² = 1.\n\nAdditionally, when applying to √2, the specific case n=2 and x=3, y=2. But the problem here is the general theorem, not the specific case. However, the user's question is about proving √2 is irrational using this method, so maybe the problem is to prove √2 is irrational, with the assumption that there exists x and y such that x² - 2y²=1 (which is given as 3² - 2*2²=1).\n\nBut in the example, they structured the problem as the original problem with the assumptions. So the original problem here is to prove that √2 is irrational, with the assumption that 3² - 2*2²=1 and the general theorem. Wait, but the user's own formatted example took the original problem's assumptions (n is integer, n divisible by 7) and then the problem statement. So here, the original problem is to prove √2 is irrational using the given proof method, which relies on the existence of x and y such that x² - 2y²=1. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem \"Prove that √2 is irrational\" would include that there exist positive integers x and y (3 and 2) satisfying x² - 2y²=1, and that n=2 is a positive integer. However, since the theorem is general, maybe the problem here is the general theorem, but the user is using the specific case as an example.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to structure the problem as per the example. The example had the problem statement from the original problem, which was about A(n) being divisible by 91, with assumptions. In the given Math Stack Exchange question, the problem presented is the theorem that if x² - ny²=1, then √n is irrational. The specific case is n=2. So the problem here is the theorem, not the specific case. So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - ny² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut in the user's example, they included the assumption that n is divisible by 7. So in this case, the problem is to prove √n is irrational given n is positive integer and there's a solution to the Pell equation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the specific case for √2, then the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n=2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that 3² - 2*2² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut the theorem is general. The user's example structured the problem as the original question, which was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 with assumptions n is integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps here, the problem is to prove √n is irrational given that n is a positive integer and there exists x,y positive integers such that x² - ny²=1. But the specific example given is for √2, using x=3, y=2.\n\nWait, the actual problem presented in the question is \"What is the most unusual proof you know that √2 is irrational?\" and the answer is a proof using the theorem. So the problem to structure is the proof that √2 is irrational, with the assumptions that 3² - 2*2²=1 and applying the theorem. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n=2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that x² - 2y²=1.\n3. The theorem that if such x and y exist, then √n is irrational.\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n- For the case of √2, 3² - 2*(2)² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut the example's formatting extracted the problem's assumptions, not the theorem's. The user wants to filter unrelated information and structure the problem. The original question is about proving √2 is irrational via a specific method. So the key assumptions for this proof method are the existence of x and y such that x² - 2y²=1 and the general theorem. But the problem is to prove √2 is irrational. Therefore, the structured problem would have assumptions related to the existence of x,y for n=2 and the theorem's conditions. However, the theorem itself is part of the proof method, not the problem's assumptions. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the example given by the user took the original problem's assumptions. In their example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is integer and n divisible by 7, leading to the problem statement. Wait, in that example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake there. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal problem in example:\n\"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n (5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Problem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which restricts n. But in reality, the original problem might have been misformatted, or maybe the example is incorrect. However, following the user's example, perhaps we are to list the conditions given in the problem. In the case of the current problem, the user presents a proof that uses the theorem: If n is a positive integer with a solution to x² - ny²=1, then √n is irrational. Then, applying it to n=2 with the solution 3² -2*2²=1. So the problem is to prove √2 is irrational, with the assumption that such x and y exist. But in reality, the existence of such x and y is part of the theorem's hypothesis. So perhaps the structured problem is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut the specific case for √2 would then be an instance of this theorem with n=2 and x=3, y=2. However, the original question is about proving √2 is irrational using this method, so maybe the problem is:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n=2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that 3² - 2*(2)² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut according to the example, assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So each assumption is a separate line. So for the specific case of √2:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer equal to 2.\n- There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds (i.e., 3² - 2*2² = 1).\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumptions for the theorem are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut the original question is about proving √2 is irrational, so maybe we need to frame it as that specific case. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n=2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that 3² - 2*2² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the general theorem presented as part of the proof, then the problem would be the theorem itself:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut the user's question is about proving √2 is irrational using this method, so the specific case. However, the example given by the user seems to have taken a general problem and added an assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem (which was for every integer n). So maybe the example is incorrect, but we have to follow it as per user's instruction.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake, but perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions from the problem, even if they are not explicitly stated. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which means no restriction on n. But the formatted problem in the example adds \"n is divisible by 7\", which changes the problem. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but since the user provided it, we have to follow their format.\n\nAssuming that, perhaps in the current problem, the assumptions are those required for the theorem, even though the original problem is about √2. So to apply the theorem to prove √2 is irrational, the assumptions would be:\n\n1. n=2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2y²=1 (specifically, x=3 and y=2).\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, the general theorem's assumptions are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y²=1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut the user's question is specifically about proving √2 is irrational, so maybe the specific case is the problem here. Given the example seems to have added an extra assumption, even though the original problem didn't have it, maybe the user wants to extract the key assumptions from the problem statement, which in this case for the specific proof of √2's irrationality are:\n\n- There exist positive integers x and y (3 and 2) such that x² - 2y²=1.\n\nBut also, n must be a positive integer (which 2 is). So:\n\nAssumptions:\n- n=2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that 3² - 2*2²=1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut maybe breaking down each assumption into separate lines:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer equal to 2.\n- There exists a positive integer x=3.\n- There exists a positive integer y=2.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds (i.e., 3² - 2*2² = 1).\n\nBut according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So \"n is a positive integer equal to 2\" is one assumption. Then \"There exists a positive integer x such that x=3\" is another? But x and y are part of the equation. Maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds.\n- For the specific case, n=2, x=3, and y=2.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So each is a separate line. In this case, for the specific problem of √2:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y.\n- x = 3.\n- y = 2.\n- The equation 3² - 2*2² = 1 holds.\n\nBut that seems too fragmented. Alternatively, combining related ones:\n\nAssumption:\n- n = 2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x = 3 and y = 2 such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nBut according to the example's structure, each assumption should be a single line addressing one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds.\n- x = 3.\n- y = 2.\n\nBut this is getting too granular. The example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as two separate assumptions, so properties related to the same object (n) are separate lines. Following that, here:\n\nFor the specific case of proving √2 is irrational using the given method:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y.\n- x = 3.\n- y = 2.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds (i.e., 3² - 2*2² = 1).\n\nBut maybe the key assumptions are the general ones from the theorem, and the specific instance is part of the problem statement. However, given the example, it's better to list all necessary assumptions for the problem, which in this case are:\n\n1. n is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that √n is irrational.\n\nBut the original question is about proving √2 is irrational, so the specific problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n = 2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x = 3 and y = 2 such that 3² - 2*2² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, combining the general theorem's assumptions applied to n=2:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nThis seems more aligned with the example where assumptions are listed line by line. So each assumption is a single line, each addressing one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y.\n- The equation x² - 2 y² = 1 holds.\n\nBut perhaps even more broken down:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions can be more concise. For instance, in the example, they had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate lines. So for this problem:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut the existence of x and y is part of the theorem's hypothesis, so in the problem statement to prove √2 is irrational, the key assumption is that such x and y exist (which they do, 3 and 2). Therefore, the structured problem should list the assumptions necessary for the proof method presented. The proof method requires two parts: the existence of solutions to the Pell equation and the contradiction derived from the rational assumption.\n\nSo the assumptions for the problem \"Prove that √2 is irrational\" using this method are:\n\n1. n = 2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x = 3 and y = 2.\n3. The equation 3² - 2*(2)² = 1 holds.\n\nBut following the example's style, each assumption is a single line. Thus:\n\nAssumption:\n- n = 2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x = 3 and y = 2.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut in the example, assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So here, \"n = 2 is a positive integer\" can be split into:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds.\n\nBut since x and y are given as 3 and 2, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- x = 3 is a positive integer.\n- y = 2 is a positive integer.\n- The equation 3² - 2*2² = 1 holds.\n\nHowever, the equation holding is a mathematical fact, so it might be considered part of the problem's given conditions. Therefore, the assumptions are that n=2, x=3, y=2 are positive integers satisfying the equation.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about n's properties. Here, the key assumptions for the proof are the existence of x and y for n=2. So the structured problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n- For the case of n=2, the equation is satisfied by x=3 and y=2.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut according to the example's formatting, each assumption is a single line. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n- x = 3.\n- y = 2.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, combining the equation with x and y:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- Positive integers x=3 and y=2 satisfy x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut how does the example handle similar cases? The example had two separate assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So if we follow that, we can list:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y.\n- The equation x² - 2 y² = 1 holds.\n\nBut the specific values of x and y (3 and 2) are part of the proof's example, not necessarily assumptions of the problem. The problem is to prove √2 is irrational given that such x and y exist. Therefore, the key assumptions are:\n\n1. n=2 is a positive integer.\n2. There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nThen the problem is to prove √2 is irrational.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut the example included even if the original problem didn't have the assumption. For instance, the original problem was for all integers n, but the formatted problem added an assumption. However, that might be an error in the example, but we need to follow it.\n\nAlternatively, considering the theorem presented in the proof, which states that if n is a positive integer and there exist positive integers x and y with x² - n y² =1, then √n is irrational. Therefore, the structured problem for the theorem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - n y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √n is irrational.\n\nThen, applying it to n=2, we have:\n\nAssumption:\n- n = 2 is a positive integer.\n- There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2 such that 3² - 2*2² =1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut the user's example structured the problem with assumptions and the problem, so here, the problem is to prove √2 is irrational with the assumption that such x and y exist. However, in the original proof, the existence of x and y is part of the theorem's hypothesis. Therefore, the structured problem for the specific case of √2 would include the assumption that such x and y exist (even though they do exist, but the problem is to use that to prove the irrationality).\n\nThus, following the example's style, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- There exist positive integers x=3 and y=2.\n- The equation x² - n y² = 1 holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nBut to match the example's structure, each assumption line should address one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer.\n- n = 2.\n- x is a positive integer.\n- y is a positive integer.\n- The equation x² - 2 y² = 1 holds.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nAlternatively, combining some:\n\nAssumption:\n- n is a positive integer equal to 2.\n- There exist positive integers x and y such that x² - 2 y² = 1.\n\nProblem: Prove that √2 is irrational.\n\nThis seems concise and follows the example where the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. The first line states n is a positive integer, the second specifies n=2, and the third states the existence of x and y satisfying the equation. Each of these is a separate assumption.",

Since 2 is a positive integer (as it belongs to the set of positive integers ℤ⁺ = {1, 2, 3, ...}), it follows immediately that n is a positive integer. This completes the proof. Note: The other assumptions (2-6) provide additional context about solutions to Pell's equation x² - ny² = 1 and other relationships, but they are not needed for this simple deduction from Assumption 1.",
