    "AcceptedAnswer":"The matrix $(A - \\lambda I)^{T}$ is the same as the matrix $\\left(A^{T} - \\lambda I\\right)$ , since the identity matrix is symmetric. Thus: $$\\det\\left(A^{T} - \\lambda I\\right) = \\det\\left((A - \\lambda I)^{T}\\right)  = \\det (A - \\lambda I)$$ From this it is obvious that the eigenvalues are the same for both $A$ and $A^{T}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read the original question again carefully. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question here is about proving that a matrix and its transpose have the same set of eigenvalues.\n\nFirst, the example they gave included assumptions that were specific conditions. In their example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the question is more general. Let me check the problem again: \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T) where A^T is the transpose matrix of A.\"\n\nWait, the problem as stated is for any square matrix A, right? Because eigenvalues are defined for square matrices. So the assumptions here might be that A is a square matrix. The original problem doesn't specify that, but eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. So perhaps the user expects me to include that as an assumption. Let me check if the original question mentions that. The title says \"A matrix and its transpose have the same set of eigenvalues\/other version: A and A^T have the same spectrum\". The question itself says \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T)...\". Since eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices, the assumption here is that A is a square matrix. But the problem statement might not explicitly state that. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were taken from the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". The second assumption in the example was \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been part of the original problem but was perhaps not stated in the problem statement as presented. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like maybe there was a mistake. Wait, 91 is 7 times 13, so if n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the problem statement in the example is to prove divisibility by 91. Hmm, that might be an error. But perhaps the user made a typo. Anyway, perhaps the example is just illustrative. So returning to the current problem: the key assumptions here are that A is a square matrix. The problem statement might not explicitly say that, but since eigenvalues are only for square matrices, that's an implicit assumption. So in the formatted problem, should I include \"A is a square matrix\" as an assumption? Let me check the original problem again. The original problem as stated by the user says: \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T) where A^T is the transpose matrix of A.\" The problem doesn't specify that A is square, but σ(A) (the spectrum) is only defined for square matrices. Therefore, the assumption must be that A is a square matrix. So I should list that as an assumption. Are there any other assumptions? The problem is general for any square matrix, so maybe there are no other assumptions. So the formatted problem's assumption section would have one line: \"A is a square matrix.\" Then the problem is to show that σ(A) = σ(A^T). Let me check if there are any other implicit conditions. For example, if the field is algebraically closed or if we're working over the complex numbers. But the problem as stated doesn't specify, so perhaps it's over any field. Wait, but eigenvalues are defined for matrices over a field. But the problem might be intended for complex matrices, or it could be general. However, since the user didn't specify, the problem likely assumes a general square matrix over a field where eigenvalues exist. But eigenvalues can exist in any field, but the existence might depend on the field. However, the standard result is that a matrix and its transpose have the same eigenvalues regardless of the field. So perhaps the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption \"A is a square matrix\" and the problem statement as given. Let me confirm with the example provided. The example had assumptions listed even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem statement was \"for every integer n\", and that was listed as an assumption. Similarly, in this case, even though the problem doesn't explicitly state \"A is a square matrix\", since σ(A) is defined only for square matrices, that is an implicit assumption, and thus should be listed. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would have Assumption: A is a square matrix. Problem: Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T). But wait, the original problem's title mentions \"other version: A and A^T have the same spectrum\". The problem statement is to show σ(A) equals σ(A^T). So yes, the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$A$ is a square matrix.\nProblem: \nShow that $ \\sigma(A) = \\sigma\\left(A^T\\right)$ where $A^T$ is the transpose matrix of $A$.\n###",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Given that $A$ is a square matrix, prove that $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)$, where $\\sigma(A)$ denotes the spectrum (set of eigenvalues) of $A$.\nLet $A$ be an $n \\times n$ matrix over a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (typically $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$). We need to prove that $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)$, where $\\sigma(A)$ denotes the set of eigenvalues of $A$.\n\n**Step 1: Definition of eigenvalues**\nRecall that $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if there exists a nonzero vector $v \\in \\mathbb{F}^n$ such that $Av = \\lambda v$. Equivalently, $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. This is because $A - \\lambda I$ is singular (non-invertible) precisely when $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue.\n\n**Step 2: Relationship between $A^T - \\lambda I$ and $A - \\lambda I$**\nConsider the transpose of $A - \\lambda I$. Using properties of transpose:\n\\begin{align*}\n(A - \\lambda I)^T &= A^T - (\\lambda I)^T \\\\\n&= A^T - \\lambda I^T \\\\\n&= A^T - \\lambda I\n\\end{align*}\nThe first equality uses the property $(M - N)^T = M^T - N^T$ for matrices $M$ and $N$. The second equality uses $(\\lambda I)^T = \\lambda I^T$ since scalar multiplication commutes with transpose. The third equality uses $I^T = I$ since the identity matrix is symmetric.\n\nThus we have shown that $A^T - \\lambda I = (A - \\lambda I)^T$.\n\n**Step 3: Determinant of transpose**\nA fundamental property of determinants is that for any square matrix $M$, $\\det(M^T) = \\det(M)$. This property holds regardless of the field $\\mathbb{F}$.\n\n**Step 4: Equality of characteristic polynomials**\nApplying the determinant property to $M = A - \\lambda I$, we get:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) &= \\det((A - \\lambda I)^T) \\\\\n&= \\det(A - \\lambda I)\n\\end{align*}\nThe first equality follows from Step 2, and the second equality follows from Step 3.\n\n**Step 5: Equivalence of eigenvalue conditions**\nFrom Step 4, we have $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = \\det(A - \\lambda I)$ for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}$. Therefore:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0 \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad \\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Step 6: Equality of spectra**\nBy the definition of eigenvalues from Step 1:\n- $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$\n- $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T$ if and only if $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0$\n\nFrom Step 5, these conditions are equivalent. Therefore, $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A^T$.\n\nThis means that $A$ and $A^T$ have exactly the same set of eigenvalues. In other words, their spectra are equal:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Conclusion:** We have proven that for any square matrix $A$, the spectrum of $A$ equals the spectrum of its transpose $A^T$. The key steps were: (1) using the characteristic polynomial definition of eigenvalues, (2) showing $A^T - \\lambda I = (A - \\lambda I)^T$, (3) applying the determinant property $\\det(M^T) = \\det(M)$, and (4) concluding that the eigenvalue conditions are equivalent.\n\n**Remark:** While $A$ and $A^T$ have the same eigenvalues, they generally do not have the same eigenvectors. The eigenvectors of $A^T$ are related to the left eigenvectors of $A$.",
    "final reviewer":"```json\n{\n\"proof_review\": true,\n\"end_of_proof\": \"final:\"\n}\n```\n**Problem:**\nGiven that $A$ is a square matrix, prove that $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)$, where $\\sigma(A)$ denotes the spectrum (set of eigenvalues) of $A$.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet $A$ be an $n \\times n$ matrix over a field $\\mathbb{F}$. The spectrum of $A$, denoted $\\sigma(A)$, is the set of all eigenvalues of $A$. We want to show that $\\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T)$.\n\n1.  **Definition of Eigenvalues via the Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    An element $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $M$ if and only if it is a root of the characteristic polynomial, which is defined by the equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $M$.\n    Thus, $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A)$ if and only if $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    Similarly, $\\lambda \\in \\sigma(A^T)$ if and only if $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Properties of Transpose and Determinant:**\n    We use two fundamental properties of matrices:\n    a) For any square matrix $M$, its transpose is $M^T$. The transpose of a difference of matrices is the difference of their transposes: $(A - B)^T = A^T - B^T$. Also, for a scalar $c$, $(cM)^T = cM^T$. The identity matrix is symmetric, so $I^T = I$.\n    b) For any square matrix $M$, the determinant of the matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose: $\\det(M) = \\det(M^T)$.\n\n3.  **Relating the Characteristic Polynomials:**\n    Let's consider the characteristic polynomial of $A^T$, which is $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I)$.\n    Using the properties of the transpose from step 2a, we can rewrite the term inside the determinant:\n    $$ A^T - \\lambda I = A^T - \\lambda I^T = A^T - (\\lambda I)^T = (A - \\lambda I)^T $$\n    Now, we can substitute this back into the characteristic equation for $A^T$:\n    $$ \\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = \\det((A - \\lambda I)^T) $$\n    Using the determinant property from step 2b, where $M = A - \\lambda I$, we have:\n    $$ \\det((A - \\lambda I)^T) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) $$\n    Combining these equalities, we find that the characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $A^T$ are identical:\n    $$ \\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = \\det(A - \\lambda I) $$\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $A^T$ are the same, they must have the same set of roots.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda$ is a root of $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$ if and only if it is a root of $\\det(A^T - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n    This means that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ if and only if it is an eigenvalue of $A^T$.\n    Consequently, the set of eigenvalues for $A$ and $A^T$ are identical.\n    $$ \\sigma(A) = \\sigma(A^T) $$\nThis completes the proof.\n\nfinal:",
