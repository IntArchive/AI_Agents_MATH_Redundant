            "text": "Proof: False\n\nThe provided proof is logically flawed in Step 2. The argument for the irreducibility of f(X) is incorrect. It fails to first establish that f(X) must be primitive and then incorrectly handles the cases of factorization. Specifically, the reasoning \"If deg(g) = deg(f), then deg(h) = 0\" contradicts the initial assumption in that part of the argument that g and h are non-constant.\n\nHere is the corrected proof.\n\n**Theorem:** Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, then 𝔓 is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈ ℤ[X].\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe consider two cases for 𝔓.\n\n**Case 1: 𝔓 = (0).**\nIf 𝔓 is the zero ideal, the theorem holds trivially.\n\n**Case 2: 𝔓 ≠ (0).**\nAssume 𝔓 is not the zero ideal.\n\n**Step 1: Choose a polynomial of minimal positive degree.**\nSince 𝔓 ≠ (0) and 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, 𝔓 must contain non-constant polynomials. By the well-ordering principle, there exists at least one polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Let f(X) be such a polynomial, and let deg(f) > 0.\n\n**Step 2: Prove f(X) is irreducible.**\nFirst, we show that f(X) must be a primitive polynomial. Let c = c(f) be the content of f(X). We can write f(X) = c · f₁(X), where f₁(X) is a primitive polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, it follows that c · f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. Because 𝔓 is a prime ideal, this implies either c ∈ 𝔓 or f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. However, c is an integer, and the hypothesis is that 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}. Since c ≠ 0 (as f is a nonzero polynomial), c cannot be in 𝔓. Therefore, f₁(X) must be in 𝔓. Since deg(f₁) = deg(f), f₁(X) is also a polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. We can thus replace f(X) with f₁(X) and assume without loss of generality that f(X) is primitive.\n\nNow, assume for the sake of contradiction that f(X) is reducible in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) is primitive, it must factor as f(X) = g(X)h(X), where g(X) and h(X) are non-constant polynomials in ℤ[X] (i.e., they are not units). This implies that deg(g) > 0 and deg(h) > 0. Consequently, deg(g) < deg(f) and deg(h) < deg(f).\n\nSince f(X) = g(X)h(X) is in 𝔓 and 𝔓 is a prime ideal, we must have g(X) ∈ 𝔓 or h(X) ∈ 𝔓. But this contradicts the choice of f(X) as a non-zero polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Therefore, the assumption that f(X) is reducible must be false. Hence, f(X) is irreducible in ℤ[X].\n\n**Step 3: Prove 𝔓 = (f(X)).**\nSince f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, the principal ideal (f(X)) is contained in 𝔓. So, (f(X)) ⊆ 𝔓.\n\nFor the reverse inclusion, let g(X) be any polynomial in 𝔓. Since ℚ is the field of fractions of ℤ, we can perform polynomial division in ℚ[X]. There exist q(X), r(X) ∈ ℚ[X] such that:\ng(X) = f(X)q(X) + r(X), where r(X) = 0 or deg(r) < deg(f).\n\nLet m be a non-zero integer that is a common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients of q(X) and r(X). Multiplying the equation by m gives:\nm·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)) + m·r(X)\nwhere m·q(X) and m·r(X) are now polynomials in ℤ[X].\n\nLet R(X) = m·r(X). The equation can be written as R(X) = m·g(X) - f(X)(m·q(X)).\nSince g(X) ∈ 𝔓 and f(X) ∈ 𝔓, and 𝔓 is an ideal, both m·g(X) and f(X)(m·q(X)) are in 𝔓. Thus, their difference, R(X), must also be in 𝔓.\n\nIf R(X) were not the zero polynomial, then deg(R) = deg(r) < deg(f). This would contradict the minimality of the degree of f(X) among non-zero polynomials in 𝔓. Therefore, R(X) must be the zero polynomial, which implies r(X) = 0.\n\nSo, we have m·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)). This shows that f(X) divides m·g(X) in ℤ[X].\nFrom Step 2, we know f(X) is an irreducible polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since its degree is positive, it is also primitive. By Gauss's Lemma, since the primitive polynomial f(X) divides the product m·g(X), it must divide either m or g(X). As deg(f) > 0, f(X) cannot divide the non-zero constant m. Therefore, f(X) must divide g(X) in ℤ[X].\n\nThis means g(X) is a multiple of f(X), so g(X) ∈ (f(X)). Since g(X) was an arbitrary element of 𝔓, we have 𝔓 ⊆ (f(X)).\n\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude that 𝔓 = (f(X)).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAny prime ideal 𝔓 in ℤ[X] with 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0} is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal (f(X)) generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n\nproof: Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 contains no nonzero constants, then 𝔓 is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈ ℤ[X].\nfinal: Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X].

Specifically, the reasoning \"If deg(g) = deg(f), then deg(h) = 0\" contradicts the initial assumption in that part of the argument that g and h are non-constant.\n\nHere is the corrected proof.\n\n**Theorem:** Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, then 𝔓 is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈ ℤ[X].\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe consider two cases for 𝔓.\n\n**Case 1: 𝔓 = (0).**\nIf 𝔓 is the zero ideal, the theorem holds trivially.\n\n**Case 2: 𝔓 ≠ (0).**\nAssume 𝔓 is not the zero ideal.\n\n**Step 1: Choose a polynomial of minimal positive degree.**\nSince 𝔓 ≠ (0) and 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, 𝔓 must contain non-constant polynomials. By the well-ordering principle, there exists at least one polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Let f(X) be such a polynomial, and let deg(f) > 0.\n\n**Step 2: Prove f(X) is irreducible.**\nFirst, we show that f(X) must be a primitive polynomial. Let c = c(f) be the content of f(X). We can write f(X) = c · f₁(X), where f₁(X) is a primitive polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, it follows that c · f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. Because 𝔓 is a prime ideal, this implies either c ∈ 𝔓 or f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. However, c is an integer, and the hypothesis is that 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}. Since c ≠ 0 (as f is a nonzero polynomial), c cannot be in 𝔓. Therefore, f₁(X) must be in 𝔓. Since deg(f₁) = deg(f), f₁(X) is also a polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. We can thus replace f(X) with f₁(X) and assume without loss of generality that f(X) is primitive.\n\nNow, assume for the sake of contradiction that f(X) is reducible in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) is primitive, it must factor as f(X) = g(X)h(X), where g(X) and h(X) are non-constant polynomials in ℤ[X] (i.e., they are not units). This implies that deg(g) > 0 and deg(h) > 0. Consequently, deg(g) < deg(f) and deg(h) < deg(f).\n\nSince f(X) = g(X)h(X) is in 𝔓 and 𝔓 is a prime ideal, we must have g(X) ∈ 𝔓 or h(X) ∈ 𝔓. But this contradicts the choice of f(X) as a non-zero polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Therefore, the assumption that f(X) is reducible must be false. Hence, f(X) is irreducible in ℤ[X].\n\n**Step 3: Prove 𝔓 = (f(X)).**\nSince f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, the principal ideal (f(X)) is contained in 𝔓. So, (f(X)) ⊆ 𝔓.\n\nFor the reverse inclusion, let g(X) be any polynomial in 𝔓. Since ℚ is the field of fractions of ℤ, we can perform polynomial division in ℚ[X]. There exist q(X), r(X) ∈ ℚ[X] such that:\ng(X) = f(X)q(X) + r(X), where r(X) = 0 or deg(r) < deg(f).\n\nLet m be a non-zero integer that is a common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients of q(X) and r(X). Multiplying the equation by m gives:\nm·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)) + m·r(X)\nwhere m·q(X) and m·r(X) are now polynomials in ℤ[X].\n\nLet R(X) = m·r(X). The equation can be written as R(X) = m·g(X) - f(X)(m·q(X)).\nSince g(X) ∈ 𝔓 and f(X) ∈ 𝔓, and 𝔓 is an ideal, both m·g(X) and f(X)(m·q(X)) are in 𝔓. Thus, their difference, R(X), must also be in 𝔓.\n\nIf R(X) were not the zero polynomial, then deg(R) = deg(r) < deg(f). This would contradict the minimality of the degree of f(X) among non-zero polynomials in 𝔓. Therefore, R(X) must be the zero polynomial, which implies r(X) = 0.\n\nSo, we have m·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)). This shows that f(X) divides m·g(X) in ℤ[X].\nFrom Step 2, we know f(X) is an irreducible polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since its degree is positive, it is also primitive. By Gauss's Lemma, since the primitive polynomial f(X) divides the product m·g(X), it must divide either m or g(X). As deg(f) > 0, f(X) cannot divide the non-zero constant m. Therefore, f(X) must divide g(X) in ℤ[X].\n\nThis means g(X) is a multiple of f(X), so g(X) ∈ (f(X)). Since g(X) was an arbitrary element of 𝔓, we have 𝔓 ⊆ (f(X)).\n\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude that 𝔓 = (f(X)).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAny prime ideal 𝔓 in ℤ[X] with 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0} is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal (f(X)) generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n\nproof: Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X].

Since 𝔓 is prime and $f(X) ∈ 𝔓$, either $g(X) ∈ 𝔓$ or $h(X) ∈ 𝔓$. By minimality of degree of $f$, the polynomial in 𝔓 ($g$ or $h$) must have degree equal to $\\deg(f)$, implying the other factor is a constant. But since 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, the constant factor must be 0, which would make $f(X) = 0$, contradiction. Therefore, $f(X)$ is irreducible.\n\nNow we show 𝔓 = $(f(X))$. Since $f(X) ∈ 𝔓$, we have $(f(X)) ⊆ 𝔓$. For the reverse inclusion, let $g(X) ∈ 𝔓$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ is a UFD and $f(X)$ is irreducible, we can write $g(X) = f(X)q(X) + r(X)$ where $r(X) = 0$ or $\\deg(r) < \\deg(f)$. Then $r(X) = g(X) - f(X)q(X) ∈ 𝔓$. By minimality of $\\deg(f)$, we must have $r(X) = 0$. Thus $g(X) ∈ (f(X))$, so 𝔓 ⊆ $(f(X))$.\n\nTherefore, 𝔓 = $(f(X))$ for some irreducible polynomial $f(X) ∈ \\mathbb{Z}[X]$.\n\nThis completes the proof that if a prime ideal 𝔓 in $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ contains no nonzero constants, then 𝔓 is either $(0)$ or $(f(X))$ for some irreducible $f(X)$.\n",
