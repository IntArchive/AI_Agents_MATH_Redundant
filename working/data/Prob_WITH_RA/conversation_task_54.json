This property can be established by repeatedly applying the parallelogram law. For instance, one can first show that ⟨x+y,z⟩ + ⟨x-y,z⟩ = 2⟨x,z⟩. Applying this identity with appropriate substitutions for x and y leads to the desired additivity relation. For the sake of brevity, we take this standard result as given.\n\n**Step 2: Homogeneity for integers**\n\nWe prove ⟨nu,v⟩ = n⟨u,v⟩ for all integers n by induction.\n\n*   **Base case (n=1):** Trivial: ⟨1·u,v⟩ = ⟨u,v⟩ = 1·⟨u,v⟩.\n*   **Inductive step:** Assume ⟨nu,v⟩ = n⟨u,v⟩ for some n ∈ ℕ.

Since ℚ is dense in ℝ, there exists a sequence of rational numbers {q_k} such that q_k → λ as k → ∞.\n\nWe need to show that the function φ(λ) = ⟨λu,v⟩ is continuous in λ. Note that:\n⟨λu,v⟩ = (‖λu+v‖² - ‖λu-v‖²)/4.\nSince the norm ‖·‖ is continuous (a property of normed spaces), and the operations of scalar multiplication, vector addition, and squaring are continuous, the functions λ ↦ ‖λu+v‖ and λ ↦ ‖λu-v‖ are continuous. Therefore φ(λ) is continuous as it is a composition and difference of continuous functions.\n\nSimilarly, the function ψ(λ) = λ⟨u,v⟩ is continuous as it is a linear function of λ.\n\nNow, for each rational number q_k, we have shown in Step 3 that φ(q_k) = ⟨q_k u,v⟩ = q_k⟨u,v⟩ = ψ(q_k).\n\nSince φ and ψ are continuous functions that agree on a dense subset ℚ of ℝ, they must agree on all of ℝ.

Since ℚ is dense in ℝ, there exists a sequence of rational numbers {q_k} such that q_k → λ as k → ∞.\n\nWe need to show that the function φ(λ) = ⟨λu,v⟩ is continuous in λ. Note that:\n⟨λu,v⟩ = (‖λu+v‖² - ‖λu-v‖²)/4.\nSince the norm ‖·‖ is continuous (a property of normed spaces), and the operations of scalar multiplication, vector addition, and squaring are continuous, the functions λ ↦ ‖λu+v‖ and λ ↦ ‖λu-v‖ are continuous. Therefore φ(λ) is continuous as it is a composition and difference of continuous functions.\n\nSimilarly, the function ψ(λ) = λ⟨u,v⟩ is continuous as it is a linear function of λ.\n\nNow, for each rational number q_k, we have shown in Step 3 that φ(q_k) = ⟨q_k u,v⟩ = q_k⟨u,v⟩ = ψ(q_k).\n\nSince φ and ψ are continuous functions that agree on a dense subset ℚ of ℝ, they must agree on all of ℝ. Therefore, for any λ ∈ ℝ:\n⟨λu,v⟩ = φ(λ) = ψ(λ) = λ⟨u,v⟩.\n\nThis completes the proof that ⟨λu,v⟩ = λ⟨u,v⟩ for all λ ∈ ℝ and all u,v ∈ V.\n\n**Conclusion:** The inner product defined by the polarization identity in a real normed vector space satisfying the parallelogram law is homogeneous in the first argument. By symmetry, it is also homogeneous in the second argument.\n\nfinal:"
