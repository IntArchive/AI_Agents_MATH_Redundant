We are given the inequality S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} for p > 1.\n\n**1. Analyze the term 2^{1-p}**\n\nSince p > 1, the exponent (1-p) is negative. As the exponential function f(x) = 2^x is strictly increasing, it follows that 2^{1-p} < 2^0 = 1. Also, since 2^x is always positive, we have 0 < 2^{1-p} < 1.\n\n**2. Establish an upper bound for the partial sums with odd indices**\n\nWe start with the given inequality:\nS_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate S_{2k+1}:\nS_{2k+1} - 2^{1-p}S_{2k+1} < 1\nS_{2k+1}(1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that 0 < 2^{1-p} < 1, which implies that the term (1 - 2^{1-p}) is a positive constant. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by this term without changing the inequality's direction:\nS_{2k+1} < 1 / (1 - 2^{1-p})\n\nLet M = 1 / (1 - 2^{1-p}). Since (1 - 2^{1-p}) is a positive constant, M is a finite positive constant. Thus, we have shown that the subsequence of partial sums with odd indices, {S_{2k+1}}, is bounded above by M.\n\n**3. Show that the entire sequence of partial sums is bounded**\n\nThe terms of the series, 1/n^p, are positive for all n ≥ 1. Consequently, the sequence of partial sums {S_n} is strictly increasing, as S_{n+1} = S_n + 1/(n+1)^p > S_n.\n\nFor any integer n, we can find an integer k such that 2k+1 ≥ n. Since the sequence {S_n} is increasing:\nS_n ≤ S_{2k+1}\n\nCombining this with the result from Step 2:\nS_n ≤ S_{2k+1} < M\n\nThis shows that every partial sum S_n is bounded above by the constant M.\n\n**4. Apply the Monotone Convergence Theorem**\n\nWe have established two properties for the sequence of partial sums {S_n}:\n1.  It is a monotone increasing sequence.\n2.  It is bounded above by M.\n\nAccording to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, any sequence that is both monotone and bounded must converge. Therefore, the sequence {S_n} converges to a finite limit.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBy the definition of an infinite series, if the sequence of its partial sums converges, the series itself converges. Since {S_n} converges, the series ∑_{n=1}^{∞} 1/n^p converges for p > 1.\n\nfinal:"
