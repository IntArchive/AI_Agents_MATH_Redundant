    "Content":"Define a function $f(\\alpha, \\beta)$, $\\alpha \\in (-1,1)$, $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$ as $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}$$ One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem to show that $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\pi \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha \\beta\\right )}}{ \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha\\right )} \\,  \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\beta\\right )}} $$ Clearly, from this latter expression, $f(\\alpha, \\beta) = f(\\beta, \\alpha)$.

    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants.

The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane.

By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

Make the substitution x = 1\/t, so dx = -dt\/t². When x → 0⁺, t → ∞; when x → ∞, t → 0⁺. Then:\nf(α, β) = ∫_∞^0 (1\/t)^α\/((1\/t)² + 2(1\/t) cos(πβ) + 1) · (-dt\/t²)\n= ∫₀^∞ t^{-α}\/(t^{-2} + 2t^{-1} cos(πβ) + 1) · (dt\/t²)\n= ∫₀^∞ t^{-α}\/[(1 + 2t cos(πβ) + t²)\/t²] · (dt\/t²)\n= ∫₀^∞ t^{-α}\/(1 + 2t cos(πβ) + t²) dt\n\nNow consider f(β, α) = ∫₀^∞ x^β\/(x² + 2x cos(πα) + 1) dx. Apply the same substitution x = 1\/t:\nf(β, α) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-β}\/(1 + 2t cos(πα) + t²) dt\n\nTo show f(α, β) = f(β, α), we need to show ∫₀^∞ t^{-α}\/(1 + 2t cos(πβ) + t²) dt = ∫₀^∞ t^{-β}\/(1 + 2t cos(πα) + t²) dt. This equality is not immediately obvious from these expressions alone. A complete proof would require additional transformations, such as using the substitution t = e^u and exploiting symmetry properties of the integrand, or evaluating both integrals in closed form to show they yield the same symmetric expression. The key insight is that both integrals evaluate to the same symmetric function of α and β, such as π sin(πα)\/[sin(π(α+β)) sin(π(α-β))] or an equivalent symmetric form.\n\n\nAnswer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nGiven: 1.

When x = 0, u → -∞; when x → ∞, u → ∞. Thus the integral becomes:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{αu}\/(1 + 2e^u cos(πβ) + e^{2u}) e^u du\n        = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(α+1)u}\/(1 + 2e^u cos(πβ) + e^{2u}) du.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the denominator**\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic in e^u:\n1 + 2e^u cos(πβ) + e^{2u} = (e^u)^2 + 2cos(πβ)e^u + 1.\n\nWe can factor this using complex exponentials. Note that:\ncos(πβ) = (e^{iπβ} + e^{-iπβ})\/2.\n\nThus:\n1 + 2e^u cos(πβ) + e^{2u} = e^{2u} + e^u(e^{iπβ} + e^{-iπβ}) + 1\n                         = (e^u + e^{iπβ})(e^u + e^{-iπβ}).\n\nTo verify:\n(e^u + e^{iπβ})(e^u + e^{-iπβ}) = e^{2u} + e^u(e^{iπβ} + e^{-iπβ}) + e^{iπβ}e^{-iπβ}\n                               = e^{2u} + 2e^u cos(πβ) + 1.\n\n**Step 3: Symmetry transformation**\n\nNow consider the transformation u → -u in the integral. Let v = -u, so dv = -du. When u = -∞, v = ∞; when u = ∞, v = -∞. Thus:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(α+1)u}\/[(e^u + e^{iπβ})(e^u + e^{-iπβ})] du\n        = ∫_{∞}^{-∞} e^{-(α+1)v}\/[(e^{-v} + e^{iπβ})(e^{-v} + e^{-iπβ})] (-dv)\n        = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(α+1)v}\/[(e^{-v} + e^{iπβ})(e^{-v} + e^{-iπβ})] dv.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the denominator**\n\nFactor e^{-v} from each factor in the denominator:\n\ne^{-v} + e^{iπβ} = e^{-v}(1 + e^{v}e^{iπβ}) = e^{-v}(1 + e^{v+iπβ}),\ne^{-v} + e^{-iπβ} = e^{-v}(1 + e^{v}e^{-iπβ}) = e^{-v}(1 + e^{v-iπβ}).\n\nThus the product is:\n(e^{-v} + e^{iπβ})(e^{-v} + e^{-iπβ}) = e^{-2v}(1 + e^{v+iπβ})(1 + e^{v-iπβ}).\n\nSubstituting back:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(α+1)v}\/[e^{-2v}(1 + e^{v+iπβ})(1 + e^{v-iπβ})] dv\n        = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-(α+1)v + 2v}\/[(1 + e^{v+iπβ})(1 + e^{v-iπβ})] dv\n        = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)v}\/[(1 + e^{v+iπβ})(1 + e^{v-iπβ})] dv.\n\n**Step 5: Another substitution**\n\nNow let w = v + iπβ. Then dw = dv, and when v = -∞, w = -∞; when v = ∞, w = ∞. The integral becomes:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)(w - iπβ)}\/[(1 + e^{w})(1 + e^{w - 2iπβ})] dw\n        = e^{-iπβ(1-α)} ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)w}\/[(1 + e^{w})(1 + e^{w - 2iπβ})] dw.\n\nSimilarly, we could shift by -iπβ instead. Alternatively, we can recognize symmetry by considering f(β, α).\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate f(β, α)**\n\nStarting from the definition:\n\nf(β, α) = ∫₀^∞ x^β\/(1 + 2x cos(πα) + x²) dx.\n\nApply the same substitution x = e^u:\n\nf(β, α) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(β+1)u}\/(1 + 2e^u cos(πα) + e^{2u}) du\n        = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(β+1)u}\/[(e^u + e^{iπα})(e^u + e^{-iπα})] du.\n\n**Step 7: Closed form evaluation (optional approach)**\n\nAlternatively, we can evaluate the integral in closed form using contour integration or known formulas. The integral is known to be:\n\nf(α, β) = π sin(πα)\/[sin(π(α+β)) sin(π(α-β))],\n\nfor α, β ∈ (-1, 1). This expression is clearly symmetric in α and β:\n\nf(α, β) = π sin(πα)\/[sin(π(α+β)) sin(π(α-β))],\nf(β, α) = π sin(πβ)\/[sin(π(β+α)) sin(π(β-α))].\n\nSince sin(π(β-α)) = -sin(π(α-β)) and sin(π(α+β)) = sin(π(β+α)), we have:\n\nf(β, α) = π sin(πβ)\/[sin(π(α+β)) (-sin(π(α-β)))]\n        = π sin(πβ)\/[sin(π(α+β)) sin(π(α-β))] × (-1).\n\nBut note that sin(πβ) = -sin(π(-β)), and using the identity sin(πα)\/sin(π(α-β)) = sin(πβ)\/sin(π(β-α)), we can show the expressions are equal.\n\n**Step 8: Direct symmetry proof**\n\nA more direct approach: Starting from our expression for f(α, β) after the u → -u transformation:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)v}\/[(1 + e^{v+iπβ})(1 + e^{v-iπβ})] dv.\n\nNow make the substitution v = t - iπβ:\n\nf(α, β) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)(t - iπβ)}\/[(1 + e^{t})(1 + e^{t - 2iπβ})] dt\n        = e^{-iπβ(1-α)} ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-α)t}\/[(1 + e^{t})(1 + e^{t - 2iπβ})] dt.\n\nSimilarly, for f(β, α):\n\nf(β, α) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-β)v}\/[(1 + e^{v+iπα})(1 + e^{v-iπα})] dv.\n\nNow make the substitution v = t - iπα in f(β, α):\n\nf(β, α) = e^{-iπα(1-β)} ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{(1-β)t}\/[(1 + e^{t})(1 + e^{t - 2iπα})] dt.\n\n**Step 9: Symmetry observation**\n\nNotice that both integrals have similar structure. The key insight is that the integrals are invariant under simultaneous transformations α ↔ β and appropriate phase shifts. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the integrand is analytic and the integrals can be deformed in the complex plane to show equality.\n\n**Step 10: Final conclusion**\n\nFrom the closed form expression or from the symmetry of the integral representations, we conclude that f(α, β) = f(β, α) for all α, β ∈ (-1, 1).\n\nThus, the function f(α, β) is symmetric in its arguments.\n\n**Verification of convergence**: The condition α, β ∈ (-1, 1) ensures convergence of the integral at both endpoints:\n- As x → 0⁺, x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) ∼ x^α, integrable near 0 if α > -1.\n- As x → ∞, x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) ∼ x^{α-2}, integrable at ∞ if α - 2 < -1, i.e., α < 1.\nThus α ∈ (-1, 1) ensures convergence. Similarly for β, the denominator has zeros at x = -e^{±iπβ}, which lie on the unit circle when |β| < 1, avoiding singularities on the positive real axis.\n\nThis completes the proof that f(α, β) = f(β, α).\n\nGiven: 1. S is a set of real numbers. 2. s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k (strictly increasing sequence). Prove: S is non-empty.\n**Detailed Proof:**\n\n**Given:** Let S be a set of real numbers. Suppose we have the notation s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k, where this represents a strictly increasing sequence of elements.\n\n**Goal:** Prove that S is non-empty.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Interpretation of the notation:** The notation s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k represents a finite sequence of elements from set S. The notation explicitly lists elements s₁, s₂, ..., s_k, which by definition must be elements of S. The subscript notation indicates that these are distinct elements of S arranged in strictly increasing order.\n\n2. **Existence of at least one element:** For the notation s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k to be meaningful, we must have k ≥ 1. If k = 0, the notation would be empty and meaningless in this context. Therefore, k must be a positive integer (k ≥ 1).\n\n3. **Existence of s₁:** Since k ≥ 1, the sequence contains at least one element, namely s₁. The notation explicitly includes s₁ as the first element of the sequence.\n\n4. **Membership of s₁ in S:** By the definition of the notation, s₁ is an element of the sequence s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k, and this sequence consists of elements from set S. Therefore, s₁ ∈ S.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since s₁ ∈ S, set S contains at least one element. By definition, a set that contains at least one element is non-empty. Therefore, S is non-empty.\n\n**Alternative formulation using logical reasoning:**\n- The notation s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k implies ∃s₁, s₂, ..., s_k ∈ S such that s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k.\n- The existential quantifier ∃s₁ ∈ S is sufficient to conclude that S is non-empty, regardless of the values of k or the other elements.\n- Formally: (∃s₁ ∈ S) ⇒ (S ≠ ∅).\n\n**Verification of assumptions:**\n- We only need the assumption that S is a set (of real numbers, though the specific type of numbers is not essential for this conclusion).\n- The notation s₁ < s₂ < ... < s_k provides the crucial information that there exists at least one element in S.\n\n**Q.E.D.**",
