    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants.

The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane.

By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ .

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"no\n**Theorem:** For α, β ∈ (-1, 1), if f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx, then f(α, β) = f(β, α).\n\n**Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Setup and Initial Observations**\n\nConsider the integral f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx where α, β ∈ (-1, 1).\n\nFirst, we factor the denominator. Note that:\n1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² = (x + e^{iπβ})(x + e^{-iπβ}) = (x - e^{iπ(β+1)})(x - e^{-iπ(β+1)})\n\nSince β ∈ (-1, 1), we have πβ ∈ (-π, π), so the roots e^{±iπβ} are complex (not on the positive real axis when β ≠ 0).\n\n**Step 2: Substitution Analysis**\n\nApply the substitution x = 1\/t, so dx = -dt\/t² and as x: 0 → ∞, we have t: ∞ → 0.\n\nf(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx\n= ∫_∞^0 (1\/t)^α · 1\/(1 + 2(1\/t)cos(πβ) + 1\/t²) · (-1\/t²) dt\n= ∫₀^∞ t^{-α} · t²\/(t² + 2t cos(πβ) + 1) · (1\/t²) dt\n= ∫₀^∞ t^{-α}\/(1 + 2t cos(πβ) + t²) dt\n\nThis shows that f(α, β) = f(-α, β). However, this alone does not establish f(α, β) = f(β, α).\n\n**Step 3: Contour Integration Setup**\n\nTo prove the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α), we employ contour integration in the complex plane.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = z^α\/(1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) where z^α = e^{α(ln|z| + i·arg(z))} with the branch cut along the positive real axis.\n\nThe poles of g(z) occur when 1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z² = 0, i.e., at z = -e^{±iπβ} = e^{iπ(1±β)}.\n\nFor β ∈ (-1, 1):\n- Pole z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} lies at angle π(1+β) ∈ (0, 2π)\n- Pole z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)} lies at angle π(1-β) ∈ (0, 2π)\n\n**Step 4: Application of Poles (Assumption 4)**\n\nUsing Assumption 4, the poles are characterized as p_n^± = ±(ln x\/(πi) + 1) + 2n where n ∈ ℤ.\n\nFor the principal branch (n = 0), the poles inside a keyhole contour are:\n- z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} with |z₁| = 1\n- z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)} with |z₂| = 1\n\n**Step 5: Keyhole Contour Construction**\n\nConstruct a keyhole contour C consisting of:\n- γ₁: Along the positive real axis from ε to R (above the branch cut)\n- γ₂: Large circle of radius R traversed counterclockwise\n- γ₃: Along the positive real axis from R to ε (below the branch cut)\n- γ₄: Small circle of radius ε around the origin\n\n**Step 6: Residue Calculation**\n\nBy the residue theorem:\n∮_C g(z) dz = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]\n\nFor a simple pole at z₀ of the form f(z)\/(z - z₀)(z - z₁), the residue is f(z₀)\/(z₀ - z₁).\n\nAt z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)}:\nRes(g, z₁) = z₁^α \/ (z₁ - z₂) = e^{iπα(1+β)} \/ (e^{iπ(1+β)} - e^{iπ(1-β)})\n\nAt z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}:\nRes(g, z₂) = z₂^α \/ (z₂ - z₁) = e^{iπα(1-β)} \/ (e^{iπ(1-β)} - e^{iπ(1+β)})\n\n**Step 7: Evaluating Contour Contributions**\n\nAs R → ∞ and ε → 0:\n- ∫_{γ₂} → 0 since |z^α\/(1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²)| ~ |z|^{α-2} → 0 for α < 1\n- ∫_{γ₄} → 0 since |z^α| ~ ε^α → 0 for α > -1\n\nThe contributions from γ₁ and γ₃ give:\n∫_{γ₁} g(z) dz = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx = f(α, β)\n∫_{γ₃} g(z) dz = -e^{2πiα} ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx = -e^{2πiα} f(α, β)\n\nTherefore:\n(1 - e^{2πiα}) f(α, β) = 2πi [Res(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂)]\n\n**Step 8: Closed-Form Evaluation**\n\nThe residues simplify as:\nRes(g, z₁) = e^{iπα(1+β)} \/ [e^{iπ(1+β)} - e^{iπ(1-β)}] = e^{iπα(1+β)} \/ [2i sin(πβ) · e^{iπ}]\n           = -e^{iπα(1+β)} \/ [2i sin(πβ)]\n\nRes(g, z₂) = e^{iπα(1-β)} \/ [e^{iπ(1-β)} - e^{iπ(1+β)}] = e^{iπα(1-β)} \/ [-2i sin(πβ) · e^{iπ}]\n           = e^{iπα(1-β)} \/ [2i sin(πβ)]\n\nSum of residues:\nRes(g, z₁) + Res(g, z₂) = [e^{iπα(1-β)} - e^{iπα(1+β)}] \/ [2i sin(πβ)]\n                        = -e^{iπα} · [e^{iπαβ} - e^{-iπαβ}] \/ [2i sin(πβ)]\n                        = -e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) \/ sin(πβ)\n\nTherefore:\nf(α, β) = 2πi · [-e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) \/ sin(πβ)] \/ (1 - e^{2πiα})\n        = 2πi · [-e^{iπα} · sin(παβ) \/ sin(πβ)] \/ [-e^{iπα}(e^{iπα} - e^{-iπα})]\n        = 2πi · sin(παβ) \/ [sin(πβ) · 2i sin(πα)]\n        = π · sin(παβ) \/ [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)]\n\n**Step 9: Symmetry Verification**\n\nThe closed-form result is:\nf(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) \/ [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)]\n\nThis expression is manifestly symmetric in α and β:\n- The numerator sin(παβ) = sin(πβα) is symmetric\n- The denominator sin(πα) · sin(πβ) = sin(πβ) · sin(πα) is symmetric\n\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\n\nSince f(α, β) = π · sin(παβ) \/ [sin(πα) · sin(πβ)] = f(β, α), we have established the symmetry:\n\n**f(α, β) = f(β, α)**\n\nThe role of Assumption 4 (defining the poles) was essential because it enabled the contour integration approach that yielded the closed-form expression, from which the symmetry is immediately apparent. Without contour integration, the symmetry is not obvious from the integral definition alone, as simple substitution only shows f(α, β) = f(-α, β), not f(α, β) = f(β, α). ∎\n\nno\nWe will prove this by contradiction.\n\n**Step 1: Assume for contradiction that ℝ is finite-dimensional over ℚ**\nSuppose ℝ is a finite-dimensional vector space over ℚ. Let its dimension be n, where n is a positive integer. This means there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ such that every real number can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination:\n\nx = q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ, where q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ ∈ ℚ.\n\n**Step 2: Establish isomorphism with ℚⁿ**\nIf ℝ has dimension n over ℚ, then ℝ is isomorphic to ℚⁿ as vector spaces over ℚ. This isomorphism φ: ℝ → ℚⁿ is given by:\n\nφ(x) = φ(q₁v₁ + q₂v₂ + ... + qₙvₙ) = (q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ).\n\nSince φ is a bijective linear transformation, ℝ ≅ ℚⁿ as ℚ-vector spaces.\n\n**Step 3: Show ℚⁿ is countable**\nℚⁿ is the Cartesian product of n copies of ℚ. Since ℚ is countable (we can enumerate rational numbers as q₁, q₂, q₃, ...), and the finite product of countable sets is countable, ℚⁿ is countable. More formally:\n\n- ℚ is countable, so there exists a bijection f: ℕ → ℚ.\n- For ℚⁿ, we can construct a bijection g: ℕ → ℚⁿ using Cantor's pairing function or diagonal enumeration.\n- Therefore, ℚⁿ is countable.\n\n**Step 4: ℝ is uncountable**\nBy Cantor's diagonal argument (or the well-known result), ℝ is uncountable. There is no bijection between ℝ and ℕ. In fact, |ℝ| = 2^{ℵ₀} > ℵ₀ = |ℕ|.\n\n**Step 5: Derive contradiction**\nFrom Step 2, ℝ ≅ ℚⁿ, so |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|. From Step 3, ℚⁿ is countable, so |ℚⁿ| = ℵ₀. From Step 4, ℝ is uncountable, so |ℝ| > ℵ₀. This gives:\n\nℵ₀ = |ℚⁿ| = |ℝ| > ℵ₀,\n\nwhich is a contradiction (ℵ₀ > ℵ₀ is false).\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nOur assumption that ℝ is finite-dimensional over ℚ leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ℝ cannot be finite-dimensional over ℚ. Hence, ℝ must be infinite-dimensional as a vector space over ℚ.\n\n**Additional remarks:**\n1. The proof relies on the fundamental fact that ℝ is uncountable while ℚⁿ is countable for any finite n.\n2. This shows that any basis for ℝ over ℚ must be uncountably infinite.\n3. The existence of a basis for ℝ over ℚ (a Hamel basis) requires the Axiom of Choice, but the proof of infinite dimensionality does not depend on constructing an actual basis, only on the impossibility of a finite basis.",

Contour Integration Setup**\\nWe define a complex function g(z) = z^α \/ (1 + 2z cos(πβ) + z²) and use a keyhole contour C around the positive real axis, which serves as the branch cut for z^α. The poles of g(z) are the roots of the denominator, z² + 2z cos(πβ) + 1 = 0. These are simple poles located at z₁ = e^{iπ(1+β)} and z₂ = e^{iπ(1-β)}.

Let its dimension be `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. This implies that there exists a basis {v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ} for ℝ over ℚ.

A bijection between two sets implies that they have the same cardinality. Thus, |ℝ| = |ℚⁿ|.\n\n3.  **Determine the cardinality of ℚⁿ.**\n    The set of rational numbers, ℚ, is countable. A fundamental result in set theory states that the finite Cartesian product of countable sets is itself countable. Since ℚⁿ is the product of `n` copies of ℚ, ℚⁿ is a countable set.
