Prove that if $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$, without using the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe want to prove the implication: If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\nLet's recall the definitions for the function $f$ at point $a \\in E$:\n*   **Sequentially continuous at $a$**: For every sequence $(x_n)$ in $E$ such that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = f(a)$.\n*   **$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$**: For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBy definition of $f$, we have $f(a) = 1$.\n\nWe proceed by considering two exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases for the point $a$ in the set $E$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is an isolated point of $E$.**\nBy definition of an isolated point, there exists a $\\delta_0 > 0$ such that the only point of $E$ in the open interval $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0)$ is $a$ itself. That is, $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0) \\cap E = \\{a\\}$.\n\nIn this case, we can show that $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\nLet $\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Choose $\\delta = \\delta_0$.\nIf $x \\in E$ and $|x - a| < \\delta$, then by our choice of $\\delta$, it must be that $x = a$.\nThen, $|f(x) - f(a)| = |f(a) - f(a)| = |1 - 1| = 0$.\nSince $0 < \\varepsilon$ for any choice of $\\varepsilon > 0$, the condition for $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity is satisfied.\nThus, if $a$ is an isolated point, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$. The implication holds in this case (as the conclusion is true).\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$.**\nIf $a$ is not an isolated point, then for every $\\delta > 0$, the set $(a - \\delta, a + \\delta) \\cap E$ contains at least one point other than $a$. This means we can find points in $E$ arbitrarily close to $a$ that are not equal to $a$.\n\nIn this case, we show that $f$ is **not** sequentially continuous at $a$.\nSince $a$ is not isolated, for each positive integer $n$, the set $(a - 1/n, a + 1/n) \\cap E \\setminus \\{a\\}$ is non-empty. We can therefore construct a sequence $(x_n)$ such that for each $n$, $x_n \\in E$, $x_n \\neq a$, and $|x_n - a| < 1/n$. This construction does not require the Axiom of Choice, as we can define an explicit rule (e.g., for each $n$, pick an element from the non-empty set).\n\nThis sequence $(x_n)$ has the following properties:\n1.  $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $E$.\n2.  $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, since $|x_n - a| < 1/n$.\n3.  For all $n$, $x_n \\neq a$, which implies $f(x_n) = 0$.\n\nNow we check the limit of $f(x_n)$:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$.\nHowever, $f(a) = 1$.\nSince $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = 0 \\neq 1 = f(a)$, the condition for sequential continuity is not met.\nTherefore, if $a$ is not an isolated point, $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nIn this second case, the hypothesis of the implication (\"$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$\") is false. In classical logic, an implication with a false hypothesis is always true (this is known as a vacuous truth).\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have examined all possibilities.\n*   If $a$ is an isolated point of $E$, the conclusion of the implication is true, so the implication is true.\n*   If $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, the hypothesis of the implication is false, so the implication is true.\n\nIn either case, the statement \"If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$\" holds.

Prove that if $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$, without using the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe want to prove the implication: If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\nLet's recall the definitions for the function $f$ at point $a \\in E$:\n*   **Sequentially continuous at $a$**: For every sequence $(x_n)$ in $E$ such that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, we have $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = f(a)$.\n*   **$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$**: For every $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(a)| < \\varepsilon$.\n\nBy definition of $f$, we have $f(a) = 1$.\n\nWe proceed by considering two exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases for the point $a$ in the set $E$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is an isolated point of $E$.**\nBy definition of an isolated point, there exists a $\\delta_0 > 0$ such that the only point of $E$ in the open interval $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0)$ is $a$ itself. That is, $(a - \\delta_0, a + \\delta_0) \\cap E = \\{a\\}$.\n\nIn this case, we can show that $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\nLet $\\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Choose $\\delta = \\delta_0$.\nIf $x \\in E$ and $|x - a| < \\delta$, then by our choice of $\\delta$, it must be that $x = a$.\nThen, $|f(x) - f(a)| = |f(a) - f(a)| = |1 - 1| = 0$.\nSince $0 < \\varepsilon$ for any choice of $\\varepsilon > 0$, the condition for $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity is satisfied.\nThus, if $a$ is an isolated point, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$. The implication holds in this case (as the conclusion is true).\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$.**\nIf $a$ is not an isolated point, then for every $\\delta > 0$, the set $(a - \\delta, a + \\delta) \\cap E$ contains at least one point other than $a$. This means we can find points in $E$ arbitrarily close to $a$ that are not equal to $a$.\n\nIn this case, we show that $f$ is **not** sequentially continuous at $a$.\nSince $a$ is not isolated, for each positive integer $n$, the set $(a - 1/n, a + 1/n) \\cap E \\setminus \\{a\\}$ is non-empty. We can therefore construct a sequence $(x_n)$ such that for each $n$, $x_n \\in E$, $x_n \\neq a$, and $|x_n - a| < 1/n$. This construction does not require the Axiom of Choice, as we can define an explicit rule (e.g., for each $n$, pick an element from the non-empty set).\n\nThis sequence $(x_n)$ has the following properties:\n1.  $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $E$.\n2.  $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n = a$, since $|x_n - a| < 1/n$.\n3.  For all $n$, $x_n \\neq a$, which implies $f(x_n) = 0$.\n\nNow we check the limit of $f(x_n)$:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 0 = 0$.\nHowever, $f(a) = 1$.\nSince $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} f(x_n) = 0 \\neq 1 = f(a)$, the condition for sequential continuity is not met.\nTherefore, if $a$ is not an isolated point, $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nIn this second case, the hypothesis of the implication (\"$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$\") is false. In classical logic, an implication with a false hypothesis is always true (this is known as a vacuous truth).\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have examined all possibilities.\n*   If $a$ is an isolated point of $E$, the conclusion of the implication is true, so the implication is true.\n*   If $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$, the hypothesis of the implication is false, so the implication is true.\n\nIn either case, the statement \"If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$\" holds.

This is the characteristic function of the singleton {a}.\nStep 2) Recall definitions: Sequential continuity at a means for every sequence (z_n) in E with z_n→a, we have f(z_n)→f(a). ε-δ continuity at a means ∀ε>0 ∃δ>0 such that ∀x∈E with |x-a|<δ, we have |f(x)-f(a)|<ε.\nStep 3) Analyze two cases based on whether a is an isolated point of E or not.\nStep 4) Case 1: a is isolated in E.

This means that for any $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta_0$, we must have $x = a$.\n\nNow, to show $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$:\n- Let $\\varepsilon > 0$ be arbitrary.\n- Choose $\\delta = \\delta_0$ (from the isolation property).\n- For any $x \\in E$ with $|x - a| < \\delta$, we have $x = a$ (by the isolation property).\n- Then $f(x) = f(a) = 1$, so $|f(x) - f(a)| = |1 - 1| = 0 < \\varepsilon$.\n\nThus, in Case 1, $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\nMoreover, in this case, $f$ is also sequentially continuous at $a$:\n- Let $(z_n)$ be any sequence in $E$ with $z_n \\to a$.\n- Since $a$ is isolated, for sufficiently large $n$, we must have $z_n = a$ (otherwise $z_n$ could not approach $a$ while staying in $E$).\n- Then $f(z_n) = 1 = f(a)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, so $f(z_n) \\to f(a)$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is not an isolated point of $E$**\n\nIf $a$ is not isolated in $E$, then for every $\\delta > 0$, the set $B(a, \\delta) \\cap (E \\setminus \\{a\\})$ is nonempty. This means there exist points in $E$ arbitrarily close to $a$ but different from $a$.\n\nIn this case, we claim $f$ is **not** sequentially continuous at $a$:\n- Since $a$ is not isolated, we can construct a sequence $(z_n)$ in $E \\setminus \\{a\\}$ such that $z_n \\to a$. This construction does not require the Axiom of Choice; we can define $z_n$ explicitly by taking points in $E \\cap (a - 1/n, a + 1/n) \\setminus \\{a\\}$, which is nonempty by the non-isolation assumption.\n- For this sequence, $f(z_n) = 0$ for all $n$ (since $z_n \\neq a$), while $f(a) = 1$.\n- Thus $f(z_n) \\to 0 \\neq 1 = f(a)$, so $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$.\n\nNow, consider the implication we need to prove: \"If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\"\n\nIn Case 2, the hypothesis \"$f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$\" is **false** (as we just showed). Therefore, the implication is **vacuously true** in Case 2. A conditional statement with a false hypothesis is always true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWe have analyzed all possible cases:\n1. If $a$ is isolated in $E$, then $f$ is both sequentially continuous and $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n2. If $a$ is not isolated in $E$, then $f$ is not sequentially continuous at $a$, making the implication \"if sequentially continuous then $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous\" vacuously true.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the implication holds: If $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$, then $f$ is $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuous at $a$.\n\n**Step 4: Avoiding the Axiom of Choice**\n\nThe proof does not require the Axiom of Choice:\n- In Case 1, we use the definition of isolated point and basic properties of continuity.\n- In Case 2, when constructing a sequence $(z_n)$ converging to $a$, we can do this without AC by using the fact that for each $n$, the set $E \\cap (a - 1/n, a + 1/n) \\setminus \\{a\\}$ is nonempty (since $a$ is not isolated). We can define $z_n$ by taking, for instance, the infimum of this set if it's bounded below, or use another explicit selection rule. Alternatively, we can argue by contradiction: if no such sequence exists, then $a$ would be isolated.\n\nThus, the proof is complete without invoking the Axiom of Choice.\n\n**Final Remark**: The key insight is that for this particular function $f$, sequential continuity forces $a$ to be isolated in $E$, and in that case, $\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ continuity follows easily. If $a$ is not isolated, then $f$ cannot be sequentially continuous, making the implication trivially true.",
