    "Content":"Show that the determinant of a matrix $A$ is equal to the product of its eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$. So I'm having a tough time figuring this one out. I know that I have to work with the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $\\det(A-\\lambda I)$. But, when considering an $n \\times n$ matrix, I do not know how to work out the proof. Should I just use the determinant formula for any $n \\times n$ matrix? I'm guessing not, because that is quite complicated. Any insights would be great.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Suppose that $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ . Then the $\\lambda$ s are also the roots of the characteristic polynomial, i.e. $$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\det (A-\\lambda I)=p(\\lambda)&=&(-1)^n (\\lambda - \\lambda_1 )(\\lambda - \\lambda_2)\\cdots (\\lambda - \\lambda_n) \\\\ &=&(-1) (\\lambda - \\lambda_1 )(-1)(\\lambda - \\lambda_2)\\cdots (-1)(\\lambda - \\lambda_n) \\\\ &=&(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda )(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda)\\cdots (\\lambda_n - \\lambda)\n\\end{array}$$ The first equality follows from the factorization of a polynomial given its roots; the leading (highest degree) coefficient $(-1)^n$ can be obtained by expanding the determinant along the diagonal. Now, by setting $\\lambda$ to zero (simply because it is a variable) we get on the left side $\\det(A)$ , and on the right side $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2\\cdots\\lambda_n$ , that is, we indeed obtain the desired result $$ \\det(A) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2\\cdots\\lambda_n$$ So the determinant of the matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to show that the determinant of a matrix A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Hmm, I remember from linear algebra that eigenvalues are related to the characteristic equation, which involves the determinant. The characteristic polynomial is det(A - λI) = 0, and the roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues. \n\nWait, so if we factor the characteristic polynomial, it would be (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)...(λₙ - λ), right? Then, the determinant of (A - λI) would be this product. But the determinant of A itself... Maybe if we set λ to zero? Because if we plug in λ = 0 into the characteristic polynomial, we get det(A) = product of eigenvalues (but with a sign maybe?). Let me check.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is det(A - λI) = (-1)^n (λⁿ - tr(A)λⁿ⁻¹ + ... + (-1)^n det(A)). If we factor it in terms of eigenvalues, it's (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)...(λₙ - λ). So when λ = 0, det(A) = (λ₁)(λ₂)...(λₙ) multiplied by (-1)^n? Wait, but expanding the product (λ₁ - λ)...(λₙ - λ) would give (-1)^n λⁿ + ... + λ₁λ₂...λₙ. Comparing the constant terms, det(A) when λ=0 is the constant term, which is product of eigenvalues times (-1)^n. But wait, the constant term of the characteristic polynomial is (-1)^n det(A). So from the factored form, the constant term is product_{i=1 to n} (λ_i - 0) = product λ_i. So that gives product λ_i = (-1)^n det(A). Hmm, so det(A) = (-1)^n product λ_i. Wait, but this contradicts the initial statement that det(A) equals the product of eigenvalues. Unless maybe the eigenvalues are considered with their algebraic multiplicities and possibly complex, but the original problem didn't specify. Or perhaps there's an assumption missing here?\n\nWait, the problem just says \"Show that the determinant of a matrix A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues λ_i.\" But maybe there's an implicit assumption that the matrix is diagonalizable or that we are working over an algebraically closed field like the complex numbers. Wait, but determinants and eigenvalues can be real or complex. However, the determinant is a real number if the matrix is real, but eigenvalues could be complex. However, the product of complex eigenvalues in conjugate pairs would give real numbers. But regardless, the determinant should still be the product of all eigenvalues, counting multiplicities, right?\n\nWait, going back. The characteristic polynomial is det(A - λI) = product_{i=1 to n} (λ_i - λ). Then, setting λ = 0, we have det(A) = product_{i=1 to n} λ_i. But wait, earlier I thought there was a (-1)^n factor. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let's see: Suppose n=2. Let A be a 2x2 matrix. Then characteristic polynomial is λ² - tr(A)λ + det(A). On the other hand, (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ) = λ² - (λ₁ + λ₂)λ + λ₁λ₂. Comparing, we have tr(A) = λ₁ + λ₂ and det(A) = λ₁λ₂. So in this case, det(A) is indeed the product of eigenvalues. So in the n=2 case, it works. For n=3, similar: the constant term of the characteristic polynomial is -det(A) for a 3x3 matrix? Wait, no. Let's check. The characteristic polynomial for a 3x3 matrix would be det(A - λI) = -λ³ + tr(A)λ² - ... + (-1)^3 det(A). So the constant term is (-1)^3 det(A) = -det(A). But the product (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)(λ₃ - λ) would expand to -λ³ + (λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃)λ² - (λ₁λ₂ + λ₁λ₃ + λ₂λ₃)λ + λ₁λ₂λ₃. Comparing the constant term, it's λ₁λ₂λ₃. But according to the determinant, the constant term is -det(A). Therefore, λ₁λ₂λ₃ = -det(A), so det(A) = -λ₁λ₂λ₃. Wait, that contradicts the 2x2 case. Hmm, no, wait in the 3x3 case, the characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0. So expanding, for 3x3, the determinant would be (-1)^3 det(A) when λ=0? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the sign. Let me compute det(A - λI). For a 3x3 matrix, this determinant is:\n\n-λ³ + tr(A)λ² - (sum of principal minors)λ + det(A).\n\nWait, no, actually the sign alternates. The general formula is det(A - λI) = (-λ)^n + tr(A)(-λ)^{n-1} + ... + det(A). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me use a different approach. For the characteristic polynomial, it's p(λ) = det(λI - A). Some authors define it as det(A - λI). The difference is a factor of (-1)^n. If p(λ) = det(λI - A), then the roots are the eigenvalues, and the constant term is det(-A) = (-1)^n det(A). But if p(λ) = det(A - λI), then the constant term when λ=0 is det(A). However, the eigenvalues are solutions to det(A - λI) = 0, so they are λ_i such that det(A - λ_i I) = 0. If we write p(λ) = det(A - λI), then p(λ) = (-1)^n λ^n + ... + det(A). The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues. But when you factor p(λ), it would be (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)...(λ - λ_n). Therefore, the constant term is (-1)^n (-λ₁)(-λ₂)...(-λ_n) = (-1)^n (-1)^n λ₁λ₂...λ_n = λ₁λ₂...λ_n. But the constant term is also det(A). Therefore, det(A) = product of eigenvalues. Ah, so the confusion was due to different definitions of the characteristic polynomial. If we define p(λ) = det(A - λI), then the constant term is det(A), and when we factor p(λ) = (-1)^n (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)...(λ - λ_n), then expanding this gives the constant term as (-1)^n (-λ₁)(-λ₂)...(-λ_n) = (-1)^n (-1)^n λ₁λ₂...λ_n = λ₁λ₂...λ_n. Hence, det(A) = product of eigenvalues. \n\nTherefore, the key is that the problem assumes the standard characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI), and thus the determinant of A is indeed equal to the product of its eigenvalues. But this requires that the eigenvalues are counted with their algebraic multiplicities, and the field is algebraically closed so that all eigenvalues exist. However, the problem as stated doesn't mention these assumptions. So when structuring the problem, we need to list the assumptions.\n\nSo the original question says \"Show that the determinant of a matrix A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\" The assumptions here might include that A is a square matrix, that we're considering complex eigenvalues (assuming the field is algebraically closed), and that eigenvalues are counted with algebraic multiplicity. However, the user didn't mention these in their question. The example given in the original problem had assumptions listed explicitly. So for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of A are considered in an algebraically closed field (like complex numbers).\n- Eigenvalues are counted with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't specify these. However, to structure it properly, we need to list the necessary assumptions. Alternatively, if the problem is over the real numbers, the determinant is still the product of eigenvalues, but some eigenvalues might be complex, but their product is still real. So maybe the key assumption is just that A is a square matrix, and eigenvalues are considered with their algebraic multiplicities. The field might be assumed to be complex implicitly.\n\nIn the example given by the user, the assumption included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So perhaps for this problem, the assumptions would be:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of A are considered with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nBut the problem as posed in the user's example didn't mention the field, but maybe in linear algebra contexts, it's assumed to be over an algebraically closed field. However, since the problem is to show that determinant equals product of eigenvalues, the necessary assumptions would be that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, which is true if the field is algebraically closed. So perhaps the assumption is that the matrix is over the complex numbers. Alternatively, if the matrix is real, but we consider complex eigenvalues, then the determinant is still the product of all eigenvalues (including complex ones).\n\nTherefore, to structure the problem:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A is an n×n matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of A are considered in an algebraically closed field (e.g., complex numbers).\n- Eigenvalues are counted with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nBut the original question didn't mention these assumptions, so perhaps the user is expected to assume standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended for diagonalizable matrices, but no, the determinant is always the product of eigenvalues regardless of diagonalizability, as long as we count multiplicities. So the key assumptions are that we're working over an algebraically closed field and considering algebraic multiplicities.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user, the original problem had an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the user's formatted problem listed that. Here, the original question doesn't state any assumptions, so we need to infer the necessary ones for the statement to hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is general and the assumptions are minimal. For example, the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues (with algebraic multiplicities) if the characteristic polynomial splits. So another way is:\n\nAssumption:\n- The characteristic polynomial of matrix A splits into linear factors.\n\nBut this is equivalent to saying that the field is algebraically closed. So to make the problem precise, the assumptions should include that A is a square matrix over an algebraically closed field, and eigenvalues are counted with multiplicity. \n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have these assumptions. But in the original question, the user didn't state any of these, so they might be implicit. However, according to the user's example, the assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property. So here's how I should structure it:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nThe eigenvalues of A are considered in an algebraically closed field,\nEach eigenvalue is counted according to its algebraic multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nBut the original question's title and body don't mention these assumptions, so maybe the problem is intended in a context where these are standard. However, the user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem but not explicitly stated in the original (like n divisible by 7). So perhaps here, the necessary assumptions are just that A is a square matrix, and the rest are part of the proof's context. Wait, but the original problem says \"the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues\". The proof requires that the eigenvalues exist (i.e., the field is algebraically closed), so perhaps that's an assumption. Alternatively, if the matrix is real, the determinant is the product of complex eigenvalues, which might be assumed.\n\nBut to structure it properly, following the example where assumptions are listed even if they were not explicit in the original question but necessary for the problem to hold. So yes, the answer must list the assumptions. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nThe eigenvalues of A are considered with their algebraic multiplicities,\nThe characteristic polynomial of A splits into linear factors.\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, combining the last two into one assumption about the field being algebraically closed. But according to the example, each assumption is one line, one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is an n×n matrix,\nThe field is algebraically closed,\nEach eigenvalue is counted according to its algebraic multiplicity.\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.\n\nBut the original problem didn't mention the field, so maybe the problem is in the context of complex matrices. Alternatively, the standard assumption in linear algebra for such problems is that we're working over the complex numbers. Therefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of A are considered in the complex field.\n- Each eigenvalue is counted with its algebraic multiplicity.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal assumption is that the characteristic polynomial splits, which is automatically true over an algebraically closed field. So I'll go with:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nThe characteristic polynomial of A splits into linear factors,\nEigenvalues are counted with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nProblem: Show that the determinant of A is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.",

Let's start from Form 1 and substitute this relationship.\n\n    *   **From Form 1 to Form 3:**\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ [(-1)(λ₁ - λ)][(-1)(λ₂ - λ)]⋯[(-1)(λₙ - λ)]\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ (-1)ⁿ (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        p(λ) = (-1)²ⁿ (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        Since (-1)²ⁿ = ((-1)²)ⁿ = 1ⁿ = 1, we get:\n        **p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)** (Form 3)\n\n    *   **Equivalence of Form 2:** Let's examine Form 2:\n        p(λ) = [(-1)(λ - λ₁)][(-1)(λ - λ₂)]⋯[(-1)(λ - λₙ)]\n        By grouping the (-1) terms, we have n of them:\n        p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n        This is identical to Form 1.\n        Alternatively, we can distribute each (-1) into its corresponding parenthesis:\n        p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n        This is identical to Form 3.\n\nThus, all three forms are algebraically equivalent representations of the characteristic polynomial.\n\nfinal:Show that for an n×n matrix A whose characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors, with eigenvalues λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ counted with algebraic multiplicities, the characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) can be written in three equivalent forms:\n1. p(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\n2. p(λ) = (-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\n3. p(λ) = (λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n\n**Proof:**\nThe characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(A - λI) is a polynomial of degree n. The leading term, which comes from the product of the diagonal entries of (A - λI), is (-1)ⁿλⁿ.\n\nBy the assumption that the polynomial splits, we can write it as p(λ) = c(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ) for some constant c. The leading term of this expanded form is cλⁿ. Comparing the leading coefficients, we must have c = (-1)ⁿ. This gives the first form:\np(λ) = (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)  (Form 1)\n\nNow we show the equivalence of the other forms through algebraic manipulation.\nConsider Form 3:\n(λ₁ - λ)(λ₂ - λ)⋯(λₙ - λ)\n= [(-1)(λ - λ₁)][(-1)(λ - λ₂)]⋯[(-1)(λ - λₙ)]\n= (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\nThis is exactly Form 1.\n\nConsider Form 2:\n(-1)(λ - λ₁)(-1)(λ - λ₂)⋯(-1)(λ - λₙ)\nThis is a product of n terms of the form [(-1)(λ - λᵢ)]. By rearranging the product, we get:\n= [(-1)·(-1)⋯(-1)] · [(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)]\n= (-1)ⁿ(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)⋯(λ - λₙ)\nThis is also Form 1.\n\nSince Forms 2 and 3 are both algebraically equivalent to Form 1, all three forms are equivalent.",
