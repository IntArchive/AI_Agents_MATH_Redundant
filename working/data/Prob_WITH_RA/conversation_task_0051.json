Since the curve is smooth, we can use the Frenet-Serret frame. 2. For the original curve parameterized by arc length $s$, the Frenet-Serret formulas give: $t'(s) = \\kappa(s)n(s)$ and $n'(s) = -\\kappa(s)t(s)$, where $\\kappa(s)$ is the curvature. 3. For a parallel curve at distance $r$: $\\beta(s) = \\alpha(s) + r n(s)$, where $\\alpha(s)$ is the original curve. 4. The tangent vector of the parallel curve: $t_\\beta(s) = \\beta'(s) = \\alpha'(s) + r n'(s) = t(s) + r(-\\kappa(s)t(s)) = (1 - r\\kappa(s))t(s)$. 5. The normal vector $n_\\beta(s)$ is obtained by rotating $t_\\beta(s)$ by 90 degrees. 6. Since $\\theta(s)$ is the angle of the tangent vector, $\\theta'(s) = \\kappa(s)$. 7. Differentiating $n_\\beta(s)$ and using the relationship between $t_\\beta(s)$ and curvature, we obtain $n'_\\beta(s) = -\\theta'(s)t_\\beta(s)$. This shows the redundant assumption can be derived from the other assumptions.\n",

Then:\nt(s) = (cos θ(s), sin θ(s))\nn(s) = (-sin θ(s), cos θ(s))\nDifferentiating t(s) gives:\nt'(s) = θ'(s)(-sin θ(s), cos θ(s)) = θ'(s)n(s)\nComparing with t'(s) = κ(s)n(s) yields κ(s) = θ'(s).\n\nSTEP 4: Express t_β(s) and n_β(s) in terms of θ.\nt_β(s) = (1 - rθ'(s))(cos θ(s), sin θ(s))\nn_β(s) = R(π/2) t_β(s) = (1 - rθ'(s))(-sin θ(s), cos θ(s)) = (1 - rθ'(s)) n(s)\n\nSTEP 5: Differentiate n_β(s).\nUsing the product rule:\nn'_β(s) = d/ds[(1 - rθ'(s)) n(s)] = -rθ''(s) n(s) + (1 - rθ'(s)) n'(s)\n\nSTEP 6: Substitute n'(s) = -κ(s)t(s) = -θ'(s)t(s):\nn'_β(s) = -rθ''(s) n(s) + (1 - rθ'(s))(-θ'(s)t(s)) = -rθ''(s) n(s) - θ'(s)(1 - rθ'(s)) t(s)\n\nSTEP 7: Recognize that (1 - rθ'(s))t(s) = t_β(s):\nn'_β(s) = -rθ''(s) n(s) - θ'(s) t_β(s)\n\nThus we have derived:\nn'_β(s) = -θ'(s) t_β(s) - rθ''(s) n(s)\n\nSTEP 8: Interpretation.\nThe expression contains two terms:\n1. -θ'(s) t_β(s), which is of the Frenet-Serret form (derivative of normal proportional to tangent)\n2. -rθ''(s) n(s), an additional term proportional to n(s)\n\nFor the claimed result n'_β(s) = -θ'(s) t_β(s) to hold, we would need rθ''(s) = 0, which occurs if either:\n- r = 0 (trivial case β = α)\n- θ''(s) = 0 (original curve has constant curvature)\n\nHowever, examining the geometry: Since n_β(s) is not a unit vector (its length is |1 - rθ'(s)|), its derivative can have a component in the n(s) direction. If we instead consider the unit normal N_β(s) = n_β(s)/|n_β(s)| = n(s), then:\nN'_β(s) = n'(s) = -θ'(s) t(s) = -θ'(s) t_β(s)/(1 - rθ'(s))\nwhich is also not equal to -θ'(s) t_β(s) unless 1 - rθ'(s) = 1.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nFollowing the proof sketch steps, we derive n'_β(s) = -θ'(s) t_β(s) - rθ''(s) n(s). The simple relation n'_β(s) = -θ'(s) t_β(s) holds only under additional conditions (e.g., constant curvature of the original curve).

It correctly identifies the additional term `-rθ''(s)n(s)` and the conditions under which this term vanishes (i.e., the original curve has constant curvature). The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Problem:**\nGiven a smooth curve α(s) parameterized by arc length with Frenet frame (t(s), n(s)) satisfying t'(s) = κ(s)n(s) and n'(s) = -κ(s)t(s). Define the parallel curve β(s) = α(s) + r n(s) for a constant r. Investigate the validity of the formula n'_β(s) = -κ(s)t_β(s), where t_β and n_β are the (non-unit) tangent and normal vectors of β, and κ(s) is the curvature of α.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet α: I → ℝ² be a smooth curve parameterized by arc length s.
