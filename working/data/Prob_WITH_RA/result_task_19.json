    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let $\\mathfrak{P}$ be a prime ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$. Then $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}$ is a prime ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}$: this holds whenever $R\\subseteq S$ are commutative rings. Indeed, if $a,b\\in R$, $ab\\in R\\cap P$, then $a\\in P$ or $b\\in P$ (since $P$ is prime). (More generally, the contraction of a prime ideal is always a prime ideal, and $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}$ is the contraction of $\\mathfrak{P}$ along the embedding $\\mathbb{Z}\\hookrightarrow\\mathbb{Z}[x]$). Thus, we have two possibilities: $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}=(0)$, or $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}=(p)$ for some prime integer $p$. Case 1. $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}=(0)$. If $\\mathfrak{P}=(0)$, we are done; otherwise, let $S=\\mathbb{Z}-\\{0\\}$. Then $S\\cap \\mathfrak{P}=\\varnothing$, $S$ is a multiplicative set, so we can localize $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ at $S$ to obtain $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$; the ideal $S^{-1}\\mathfrak{P}$ is prime in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, and so is of the form $(q(x))$ for some irreducible polynomial $q(x)$. Clearing denominators and factoring out content we may assume that $q(x)$ has integer coefficients and the gcd of the coefficients is $1$. I claim that $\\mathfrak{P}=(q(x))$. Indeed, from the theory of localizations, we know that $\\mathfrak{P}$ consists precisely of the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ which, when considered to be elements of $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, lie in $S^{-1}\\mathfrak{P}$. That is, $\\mathfrak{P}$ consists precisely of the rational multiples of $q(x)$ that have integer coefficients. In particular, every integer multiple of $q(x)$ lies in $\\mathfrak{P}$, so $(q(x))\\subseteq \\mathfrak{P}$. But, moreover, if $f(x)=\\frac{r}{s}q(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, then $s$ divides all coefficients of $q(x)$; since $q(x)$ is primitive, it follows that $s\\in\\{1,-1\\}$, so $f(x)$ is actually an integer multiple of $q(x)$. Thus, $\\mathfrak{P}\\subseteq (q(x))$, proving equality. Thus, if $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}=(0)$, then either $\\mathfrak{P}=(0)$, or $\\mathfrak{P}=(q(x))$ where $q(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is irreducible. Case 2. $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}=(p)$. We can then consider the image of $\\mathfrak{P}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]\/(p)\\cong\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. The image is prime, since the map is onto; the prime ideals of $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ are $(0)$ and ideals of the form $(q(x))$ with $q(x)$ monic irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. If the image is $(0)$, then $\\mathfrak{P}=(p)$, and we are done. Otherwise, let $p(x)$ be a polynomial in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ that reduces to $q(x)$ modulo $p$ and that is monic. Note that $p(x)$ must be irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$, since any nontrivial factorization in $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ would induce a nontrivial factorization in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ (since $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are both monic). I claim that $\\mathfrak{P}=(p,p(x))$. Indeed, the isomorphism theorems guarantee that $(p,p(x))\\subseteq \\mathfrak{P}$. Conversely, let $r(x)\\in\\mathfrak{P}(x)$. Then there exists a polynomial $s(x)\\in\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ such that $s(x)q(x) = \\overline{r}(x)$. If $t(x)$ is any polynomial that reduces to $s(x)$ modulo $p$, then $t(x)p(x)-r(x)\\in (p)$, hence there exists a polynomial $u(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $r(x) = t(x)p(x)+pu(x)$. Therefore, $r(x)\\in (p,p(x))$, hence $\\mathfrak{P}\\subseteq (p,p(x))$, giving equality. Thus, if $\\mathfrak{P}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}[x]=(p)$ with $p$ a prime, then either $\\mathfrak{P}=(p)$ or $\\mathfrak{P}=(p,p(x))$ with $p(x)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ irreducible. This proves the desired classification.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The user is asking about the classification of prime ideals in the ring ℤ[X]. They list four types: (0), principal ideals generated by irreducible polynomials, principal ideals generated by prime numbers, and ideals generated by a prime number and a polynomial that's irreducible modulo that prime. The question is whether every prime ideal in ℤ[X] falls into one of these categories and how to prove it.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about prime ideals in ℤ[X]. The ring in question is ℤ[X], which is polynomials in one variable over the integers. The user is suggesting four types of prime ideals. The assumptions here are the properties each type must satisfy. Each assumption should address one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the types listed:\n\n1. (0) is the zero ideal, which is prime in a domain. But ℤ[X] is a domain, so (0) is prime.\n2. (f(X)) where f is irreducible. In a PID, irreducible elements generate prime ideals, but ℤ[X] isn't a PID. However, if f is irreducible, maybe (f(X)) is still prime? But I recall that in ℤ[X], irreducible polynomials generate prime ideals only under certain conditions. Wait, but the user is listing this as a possible type, so the assumption here is that f(X) is irreducible.\n3. (p) where p is a prime number. This is a principal ideal generated by a prime integer. Since p is prime in ℤ, but in ℤ[X], does (p) remain prime? The ideal (p) in ℤ[X] would consist of all polynomials with coefficients divisible by p. The quotient ring ℤ[X]\/(p) is isomorphic to 𝔽_p[X], which is a domain, so (p) is indeed a prime ideal.\n4. (p, f(X)) where p is prime and f is irreducible modulo p. Here, the ideal is generated by p and a polynomial that's irreducible over 𝔽_p. The quotient ring ℤ[X]\/(p, f(X)) would be 𝔽_p[X]\/(f(X)), which is a field since f is irreducible, hence this ideal is maximal and therefore prime.\n\nThe problem is to show that every prime ideal in ℤ[X] is one of these four types. So the assumptions are the conditions each type must satisfy. Each assumption line should list one condition applied to one object. So breaking it down:\n\n- The ring is ℤ[X].\n- Consider prime ideals of ℤ[X].\n- The prime ideal could be the zero ideal (0).\n- The prime ideal could be principal, generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n- The prime ideal could be principal, generated by a prime number p.\n- The prime ideal could be generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p.\n\nBut the original problem states \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types?\" followed by the list. So the assumptions here are the four types listed. However, in the example provided, the assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in this case, the problem's assumptions are the possible types of prime ideals, each being a separate condition.\n\nWait, but in the example, the user had to list the assumptions given in the problem. The original problem had the number A(n) defined, and the assumption was that n is an integer and divisible by 7. The formatted problem clarified that. But in this case, the problem is asking whether all prime ideals are of certain types. So the assumptions here are the conditions that define each type. Each type is a possible case for a prime ideal. Therefore, each assumption should correspond to a type.\n\nHowever, the user's example had the assumptions as conditions given in the problem. Here, the problem is asking to classify prime ideals into these types. So perhaps the assumptions here are the different cases that the problem is considering. Wait, no. The original problem is asking whether every prime ideal is one of these types. The answer would involve proving that any prime ideal must fall into one of these categories. Therefore, the assumptions are the properties that define each type. But how to list them?\n\nWait, the user's example extracted the conditions given in the problem. The original problem in the example had a number defined as A(n) and wanted to prove it's divisible by 91. The user listed the assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are the properties that the problem states. But in the current problem, the question is about classifying prime ideals, and the possible types are listed. However, the problem isn't making any assumptions but asking whether these are all the possibilities. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are the possible cases, but since the problem is a classification, the formatted problem should list the problem as \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types?\" followed by the list, and the assumptions are the properties each type must satisfy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that define each type of prime ideal. Let me look again at the example. The example's original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91. The user structured it with assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem statement, the user had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted example added an extra assumption. Wait, maybe the example was from a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that seems contradictory because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests that maybe the user made a mistake in their example, or perhaps it's a different problem. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo, but as per the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. So perhaps in their example, the original problem was missing that assumption, and the user added it. But that might not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is a different problem where the original problem had an error, and the formatted version corrected it. Alternatively, maybe the example is just illustrative. Anyway, following that example, the task is to list the assumptions from the problem. In the current problem, the user is asking whether every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the listed types. The problem doesn't state any assumptions but is asking for a proof of classification. So in this case, the assumptions would be the conditions that define each type. Each type is a possible form of a prime ideal, so each assumption would be a condition on the prime ideal. For example:\n\nAssumption: The prime ideal is the zero ideal (0).\n\nAssumption: The prime ideal is principal, generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n\nAssumption: The prime ideal is principal, generated by a prime number p.\n\nAssumption: The prime ideal is generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user is listing these as possible types and asking if these are all. So the problem is to prove that any prime ideal in ℤ[X] must be one of these four types. Therefore, the assumptions are the four cases. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were the conditions on n. Here, the problem is about classifying prime ideals, so the assumptions are the different forms the prime ideals can take.\n\nBut according to the user's example, assumptions are the given conditions in the problem. In this case, the problem doesn't state assumptions but asks to prove that all prime ideals are of these types. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions here are the properties that each type must satisfy. For each type, the ideal is prime. So:\n\nAssumption: (0) is a prime ideal in ℤ[X].\n\nAssumption: (f(X)) is a prime ideal when f(X) is irreducible.\n\nAssumption: (p) is a prime ideal when p is a prime number.\n\nAssumption: (p, f(X)) is a prime ideal when p is prime and f(X) is irreducible modulo p.\n\nBut the problem is to show that these are the only prime ideals. So perhaps the assumptions are that these are prime ideals, and the problem is to show there are no others. But the original question is phrased as \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types?\" So the user is asking for confirmation and a proof. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the \"Assumption\" section should list the conditions that define each type. But each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking down each type:\n\n1. The zero ideal (0) is a prime ideal. (Since ℤ[X] is an integral domain, the zero ideal is prime.)\n\n2. A principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X). (In ℤ[X], if f is irreducible, then (f) is a prime ideal.)\n\n3. A principal ideal generated by a prime number p. (In ℤ[X], (p) is prime because ℤ[X]\/(p) ≅ 𝔽_p[X], which is a domain.)\n\n4. An ideal generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p. (Then (p, f(X)) is prime because the quotient is 𝔽_p[X]\/(f(X)), which is a field, hence the ideal is maximal and prime.)\n\nThus, the assumptions are each of these conditions. So each line in the Assumption section would be:\n\n- The prime ideal is the zero ideal (0).\n- The prime ideal is generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n- The prime ideal is generated by a prime number p.\n- The prime ideal is generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were about the properties of n. Here, the \"assumptions\" would be the different possible cases that the problem is considering. However, the problem is asking if every prime ideal is one of these types. Therefore, the formatted problem should list the problem as \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types?\" followed by the list, and the assumptions are the conditions that define each type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the ring ℤ[X] has, which allow such a classification. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So maybe in this case, the assumptions are about the ring ℤ[X] being the ring of polynomials over ℤ, and perhaps that we're considering prime ideals. But the problem itself is about classifying prime ideals in ℤ[X], so the main assumption is that we're working in ℤ[X], and considering its prime ideals.\n\nBut the user's example extracted the conditions on n. So in this case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ℤ[X] is the ring of polynomials in one variable over ℤ.\n- We are considering prime ideals in ℤ[X].\n\nBut the original problem doesn't state those as assumptions; they are part of the problem statement. The user's example included the assumption that n is an integer, which was part of the original problem's statement (\"for every integer n\"). So in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The ring in question is ℤ[X].\n- We are classifying prime ideals of ℤ[X].\n\nBut the problem as stated by the user is: \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types? If yes, how to prove this? (0), (f(X)) irreducible, (p) prime, (p, f(X)) with f irreducible modulo p.\"\n\nSo to structure this into Assumption and Problem sections:\n\nAssumption would list the conditions that define each type of prime ideal. Each type is a separate assumption. But each assumption must address only one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo:\n\nAssumption:\nThe prime ideal is the zero ideal (0).\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by a prime number p.\nThe prime ideal is generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p.\n\nProblem:\nIs every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the listed types? If yes, provide a proof.\n\nBut according to the example, the problem section should restate the problem concisely. The example's problem section was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nSo in this case, the problem section would be: \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types: (0), (f(X)) with f irreducible, (p) with p prime, or (p, f(X)) with p prime and f irreducible modulo p? If yes, provide a proof.\"\n\nBut the user's example structured the problem as just the statement to prove, omitting the \"If yes, how...\" part. So perhaps the problem section should be the main question: \"Prove that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the following types: ...\"\n\nBut the original question is phrased as \"Is every prime ideal...? If yes, how to prove this?\"\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove something, and the formatted problem was \"Prove that...\". So here, the problem would be \"Prove that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the following types: ...\", assuming the answer is yes. Since the user is asking for a proof if the classification is correct, the problem is to prove the classification.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption: \nThe prime ideal is the zero ideal (0).\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by an irreducible polynomial.\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by a prime number.\nThe prime ideal is generated by a prime number and a polynomial irreducible modulo that prime.\n\nProblem: \nProve that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the listed types.\n\nBut according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. In the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became an assumption that n is an integer. Then there was an additional assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem's assumption added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Unless there was a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the original example had a different problem where the user made a mistake. For instance, maybe the original problem had n being any integer, but the formatted problem added that n must be divisible by 7. That would be incorrect unless the original problem had a typo. But regardless, following the user's example, the task is to list the assumptions from the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user is asking if every prime ideal is one of the listed types. The problem doesn't state any assumptions beyond the ring being ℤ[X]. So the assumptions here would be the properties of each type of prime ideal. But in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps here, the assumptions are the different cases that the problem is considering. However, the example seems to have listed the conditions on n, which were given in the original problem (for every integer n), but the formatted problem added an assumption not present in the original (n divisible by 7). That might have been a mistake, but following the example, perhaps the assumptions are the conditions that define the problem.\n\nIn the current problem, the types of prime ideals are listed, so each type is a separate assumption. Therefore:\n\nAssumption:\nThe prime ideal is (0).\nThe prime ideal is principal, generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\nThe prime ideal is principal, generated by a prime number p.\nThe prime ideal is generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) irreducible modulo p.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the listed types.\n\nBut the original problem's question is phrased as \"Is every prime ideal...? If yes, how to prove this?\" So perhaps the problem should be \"Is every prime ideal of ℤ[X] one of the following types? If yes, provide a proof.\" But according to the example, the problem section is just the statement to prove. So maybe it's better to phrase it as \"Prove that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the following types: (0), (f(X)) with f irreducible, (p) with p prime, or (p, f(X)) with p prime and f irreducible modulo p.\"\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe prime ideal is the zero ideal (0).\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by an irreducible polynomial.\nThe prime ideal is principal and generated by a prime number.\nThe prime ideal is generated by a prime number and a polynomial irreducible modulo that prime.\n\nProblem:\nProve that every prime ideal of $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ is one of the listed types.\n\nBut to adhere strictly to the example, where assumptions were the conditions on the variables (n is integer, n divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions are the properties each prime ideal must satisfy. However, in this case, the problem is about classifying all prime ideals, so the assumptions are the possible cases. But I think the key is to list each type as a separate assumption, each being a condition that a prime ideal can satisfy. Hence, each bullet point in assumptions corresponds to one type of prime ideal.",

Note that:\\n- deg(g) > 0 (since g is non-constant)\\n- deg(g) ≤ deg(f) because f = gh\\n- By the minimality of deg(f) among nonzero polynomials in 𝔓, we must have deg(g) = deg(f)\\n\\nIf deg(g) = deg(f), then deg(h) = 0, so h(X) = c for some nonzero constant c ∈ ℤ. But then f(X) = c·g(X), and since f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, we have c·g(X) ∈ 𝔓. However, 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, so c cannot be in 𝔓 unless c = 0. But c ≠ 0 (otherwise f = 0), so we have a contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, f(X) cannot be reducible, so f(X) is irreducible in ℤ[X].\\n\\n**Step 3: Prove 𝔓 = (f(X)).**\\nWe need to show that 𝔓 is exactly the principal ideal generated by f(X).\\n\\nFirst, note that (f) ⊆ 𝔓 because f ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal.\\n\\nFor the reverse inclusion 𝔓 ⊆ (f), take any g(X) ∈ 𝔓.

Therefore, m·r(X) = m·g(X) - f(X)·(m·q(X)) ∈ 𝔓.\\n\\nNow consider m·r(X). If m·r(X) ≠ 0, then:\\n- deg(m·r(X)) = deg(r(X)) < deg(f) (since clearing denominators doesn't change degree)\\n- m·r(X) ∈ 𝔓\\n- This contradicts the minimality of deg(f) among nonzero polynomials in 𝔓\\n\\nTherefore, we must have m·r(X) = 0, which implies r(X) = 0.\\n\\nThus, g(X) = f(X)q(X) in ℚ[X]. Since f(X) is primitive (irreducible in ℤ[X] implies primitive), by Gauss's Lemma, we actually have q(X) ∈ ℤ[X].

    "final reviewer":"Proof: False\n\nThe provided proof is logically flawed in Step 2. The argument for the irreducibility of f(X) is incorrect. It fails to first establish that f(X) must be primitive and then incorrectly handles the cases of factorization. Specifically, the reasoning \"If deg(g) = deg(f), then deg(h) = 0\" contradicts the initial assumption in that part of the argument that g and h are non-constant.\n\nHere is the corrected proof.\n\n**Theorem:** Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, then 𝔓 is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈ ℤ[X].\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe consider two cases for 𝔓.\n\n**Case 1: 𝔓 = (0).**\nIf 𝔓 is the zero ideal, the theorem holds trivially.\n\n**Case 2: 𝔓 ≠ (0).**\nAssume 𝔓 is not the zero ideal.\n\n**Step 1: Choose a polynomial of minimal positive degree.**\nSince 𝔓 ≠ (0) and 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, 𝔓 must contain non-constant polynomials. By the well-ordering principle, there exists at least one polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Let f(X) be such a polynomial, and let deg(f) > 0.\n\n**Step 2: Prove f(X) is irreducible.**\nFirst, we show that f(X) must be a primitive polynomial. Let c = c(f) be the content of f(X). We can write f(X) = c · f₁(X), where f₁(X) is a primitive polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, it follows that c · f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. Because 𝔓 is a prime ideal, this implies either c ∈ 𝔓 or f₁(X) ∈ 𝔓. However, c is an integer, and the hypothesis is that 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}. Since c ≠ 0 (as f is a nonzero polynomial), c cannot be in 𝔓. Therefore, f₁(X) must be in 𝔓. Since deg(f₁) = deg(f), f₁(X) is also a polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. We can thus replace f(X) with f₁(X) and assume without loss of generality that f(X) is primitive.\n\nNow, assume for the sake of contradiction that f(X) is reducible in ℤ[X]. Since f(X) is primitive, it must factor as f(X) = g(X)h(X), where g(X) and h(X) are non-constant polynomials in ℤ[X] (i.e., they are not units). This implies that deg(g) > 0 and deg(h) > 0. Consequently, deg(g) < deg(f) and deg(h) < deg(f).\n\nSince f(X) = g(X)h(X) is in 𝔓 and 𝔓 is a prime ideal, we must have g(X) ∈ 𝔓 or h(X) ∈ 𝔓. But this contradicts the choice of f(X) as a non-zero polynomial of minimal positive degree in 𝔓. Therefore, the assumption that f(X) is reducible must be false. Hence, f(X) is irreducible in ℤ[X].\n\n**Step 3: Prove 𝔓 = (f(X)).**\nSince f(X) ∈ 𝔓 and 𝔓 is an ideal, the principal ideal (f(X)) is contained in 𝔓. So, (f(X)) ⊆ 𝔓.\n\nFor the reverse inclusion, let g(X) be any polynomial in 𝔓. Since ℚ is the field of fractions of ℤ, we can perform polynomial division in ℚ[X]. There exist q(X), r(X) ∈ ℚ[X] such that:\ng(X) = f(X)q(X) + r(X), where r(X) = 0 or deg(r) < deg(f).\n\nLet m be a non-zero integer that is a common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients of q(X) and r(X). Multiplying the equation by m gives:\nm·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)) + m·r(X)\nwhere m·q(X) and m·r(X) are now polynomials in ℤ[X].\n\nLet R(X) = m·r(X). The equation can be written as R(X) = m·g(X) - f(X)(m·q(X)).\nSince g(X) ∈ 𝔓 and f(X) ∈ 𝔓, and 𝔓 is an ideal, both m·g(X) and f(X)(m·q(X)) are in 𝔓. Thus, their difference, R(X), must also be in 𝔓.\n\nIf R(X) were not the zero polynomial, then deg(R) = deg(r) < deg(f). This would contradict the minimality of the degree of f(X) among non-zero polynomials in 𝔓. Therefore, R(X) must be the zero polynomial, which implies r(X) = 0.\n\nSo, we have m·g(X) = f(X)(m·q(X)). This shows that f(X) divides m·g(X) in ℤ[X].\nFrom Step 2, we know f(X) is an irreducible polynomial in ℤ[X]. Since its degree is positive, it is also primitive. By Gauss's Lemma, since the primitive polynomial f(X) divides the product m·g(X), it must divide either m or g(X). As deg(f) > 0, f(X) cannot divide the non-zero constant m. Therefore, f(X) must divide g(X) in ℤ[X].\n\nThis means g(X) is a multiple of f(X), so g(X) ∈ (f(X)). Since g(X) was an arbitrary element of 𝔓, we have 𝔓 ⊆ (f(X)).\n\nCombining both inclusions, we conclude that 𝔓 = (f(X)).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAny prime ideal 𝔓 in ℤ[X] with 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0} is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal (f(X)) generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X).\n\nproof: Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 contains no nonzero constants, then 𝔓 is either the zero ideal (0) or a principal ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈ ℤ[X].\nfinal: Let 𝔓 be a prime ideal in ℤ[X]. If 𝔓 ∩ ℤ = {0}, then 𝔓 is either (0) or a principal ideal (f) for some irreducible polynomial f ∈ ℤ[X].",
