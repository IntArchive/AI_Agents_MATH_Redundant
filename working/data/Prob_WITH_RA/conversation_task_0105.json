Since $n$ is square-free and $n \\geq 3$, $n$ is odd (if $n$ were even and square-free, it would be $2m$ with $m$ odd, but then $n \\geq 3$ implies $m \\geq 2$, and $n$ would not necessarily be odd - wait, let's reconsider). Actually, we need $n$ to be odd for the proof to work. Many such $n$ are odd (e.g., $n=3,5,6,7,10,\\ldots$). For the proof, we consider the case where $n$ is odd.\n\n2. When $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even, so $2$ divides $n+1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3. In $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n}) = 1 - (\\sqrt{-n})^2 = 1 - (-n) = 1+n$ (using the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$).\n\n4. Thus $2$ divides $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n5. We claim $2$ does not divide $1+\\sqrt{-n}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$. Suppose for contradiction that $2$ divides $1+\\sqrt{-n}$. Then there exist integers $a,b$ such that $2(a+b\\sqrt{-n}) = 1+\\sqrt{-n}$. This implies $2a=1$ and $2b=1$, which is impossible in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, $2$ does not divide $1-\\sqrt{-n}$.\n\n6. Therefore, $2$ divides the product $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ but does not divide either factor. This means $2$ is not a prime element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n7. By Assumption 5, $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n8. In a unique factorization domain, every irreducible element is prime. Since $2$ is irreducible but not prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ cannot be a UFD.\n\nNote: The proof uses the fact that $(\\sqrt{-n})^2 = -n$, which is inherent in the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$, so it doesn't need to be stated as a separate assumption.\n"

To prove that R is not a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), we will show that there exists an element that is irreducible but not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element must be prime. We are given that 2 is irreducible in R, so we only need to show that 2 is not prime.\n\nAn element `p` is prime if whenever `p` divides a product `ab`, then `p` must divide `a` or `p` must divide `b`. We will show that 2 does not satisfy this property. We consider two cases based on the parity of n.\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n):\n(1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is a positive odd integer, 1 + n is an even integer. Thus, 2 divides 1 + n in ℤ, which implies 2 divides (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) in R.\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides either of the factors in R.\nSuppose 2 divides (1 + √-n). Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n1 + √-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n1 = 2a\n1 = 2b\nThis system has no integer solutions for `a` and `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide (1 + √-n).\nA similar argument shows that 2 does not divide (1 - √-n).\n\nSince 2 divides the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) but does not divide either factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is a square-free integer, if n is even, it must be of the form n = 2k for some odd integer k.\nConsider the product (√-n)(√-n):\n(√-n)(√-n) = -n.\nSince n is even, 2 divides n in ℤ, and therefore 2 divides -n in R. So, 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n).\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides the factor √-n in R.\nSuppose 2 divides √-n. Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n√-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n0 = 2a  => a = 0\n1 = 2b\nThe equation 1 = 2b has no integer solution for `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide √-n.\n\nSince 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n) but does not divide the factor √-n, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn both cases (n odd and n even), we have shown that 2 is not a prime element in R = ℤ[√-n]. We are given that 2 is an irreducible element. Since R contains an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nfinal:"

Since $n$ is square-free and $n \\geq 3$, $n$ is odd (if $n$ were even and square-free, it would be $2m$ with $m$ odd, but then $n \\geq 3$ implies $m \\geq 2$, and $n$ would not necessarily be odd - wait, let's reconsider). Actually, we need $n$ to be odd for the proof to work. Many such $n$ are odd (e.g., $n=3,5,6,7,10,\\ldots$). For the proof, we consider the case where $n$ is odd.\n\n2. When $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even, so $2$ divides $n+1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3. In $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n}) = 1 - (\\sqrt{-n})^2 = 1 - (-n) = 1+n$ (using the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$).\n\n4. Thus $2$ divides $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n5. We claim $2$ does not divide $1+\\sqrt{-n}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$. Suppose for contradiction that $2$ divides $1+\\sqrt{-n}$. Then there exist integers $a,b$ such that $2(a+b\\sqrt{-n}) = 1+\\sqrt{-n}$. This implies $2a=1$ and $2b=1$, which is impossible in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, $2$ does not divide $1-\\sqrt{-n}$.\n\n6. Therefore, $2$ divides the product $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ but does not divide either factor. This means $2$ is not a prime element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n7. By Assumption 5, $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n8. In a unique factorization domain, every irreducible element is prime.

If n were even and square-free, the only possibilities would be n = 2, but n ≥ 3, so n cannot be 2. Therefore n is odd, which implies n+1 is even.\n\n**Step 2: Factorization in ℤ[√-n]**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n).

More formally, there exists an element q = (n+1)/2 ∈ ℤ ⊂ ℤ[√-n] such that 2q = (1+√-n)(1-√-n).\n\n**Step 4: 2 does not divide 1+√-n**\nSuppose, for contradiction, that 2 divides 1+√-n in ℤ[√-n].

This contradiction shows that 2 does not divide 1+√-n in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 5: 2 does not divide 1-√-n**\nSimilarly, suppose 2 divides 1-√-n. Then there exist integers a,b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n\n\nExpanding: 2a + 2b√-n = 1 - √-n\n\nComparing coefficients:\n2a = 1  and  2b = -1\n\nAgain, 2a = 1 has no integer solution, so 2 does not divide 1-√-n in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 6: 2 is not prime**\nWe have shown that:\n1. 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n)\n2. 2 does not divide 1+√-n\n3. 2 does not divide 1-√-n\n\nBy definition, an element p in an integral domain is prime if whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Since 2 divides the product but divides neither factor, 2 is not a prime element in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 7: 2 is irreducible (given)**\nBy assumption, 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]. Recall that an element r is irreducible if r is nonzero, not a unit, and whenever r = xy, then either x or y is a unit.\n\n**Step 8: Contradiction with UFD properties**\nIn a unique factorization domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. This is a fundamental property of UFDs: irreducibles and primes coincide.\n\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\nWe have found an element 2 in ℤ[√-n] that is irreducible (by assumption) but not prime (as shown in Steps 1-6). Therefore, ℤ[√-n] cannot be a UFD, since in a UFD, all irreducible elements must be prime.\n\nThus, under the given assumptions that n is square-free with n ≥ 3 and 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], the ring ℤ[√-n] is not a unique factorization domain."

We are given that n ≥ 3 is an integer, n is square-free, and that 2, √-n, and 1+√-n are irreducible elements in R.\n\nWe will show that R is not a UFD by demonstrating that 2 is an irreducible element that is not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime, so if we find an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 1: Case analysis based on parity of n**\nSince n ≥ 3 and is square-free, n could be either odd or even. We consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). We compute:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is even and square-free with n ≥ 3, n must be of the form 2k where k is an odd integer ≥ 2 (because if k were even, n would have a square factor 4). Consider the product (2+√-n)(2-√-n). We compute:\n(2+√-n)(2-√-n) = 4 - (√-n)² = 4 - (-n) = 4 + n.\nSince n is even, 4+n is even, so 2 divides 4+n in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (2+√-n)(2-√-n) in R.\n\n**Step 2: Show 2 does not divide the factors**\nWe need to show that in both cases, 2 does not divide either factor in R.\n\nFor Case 1 (n odd):\nSuppose 2 divides 1+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n.\nThis gives the system: 2a = 1 and 2b = 1.\nBut these equations have no integer solutions, so 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 1-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n gives 2a = 1 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solutions.\n\nFor Case 2 (n even):\nSuppose 2 divides 2+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 2 + √-n.\nThis gives: 2a = 2 and 2b = 1.\nThe equation 2b = 1 has no integer solution, so 2 does not divide 2+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 2-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 2 - √-n gives 2a = 2 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solution.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion that 2 is not prime**\nIn both cases, we have found a product in R that is divisible by 2, but neither factor is divisible by 2. By definition, an element p in a commutative ring is prime if whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Since 2 divides a product but divides neither factor, 2 is not prime in R.\n\n**Step 4: Use given irreducibility of 2**\nWe are given that 2 is irreducible in R. An irreducible element is one that cannot be written as a product of two non-units.\n\n**Step 5: UFD property violation**\nIn a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. We have shown that 2 is irreducible in R but is not prime. Therefore, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion**\nThus, ℤ[√-n] is not a Unique Factorization Domain under the given conditions."

To prove that R is not a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), we will show that there exists an element that is irreducible but not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element must be prime. We are given that 2 is irreducible in R, so we only need to show that 2 is not prime.\n\nAn element `p` is prime if whenever `p` divides a product `ab`, then `p` must divide `a` or `p` must divide `b`. We will show that 2 does not satisfy this property. We consider two cases based on the parity of n.\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n):\n(1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is a positive odd integer, 1 + n is an even integer. Thus, 2 divides 1 + n in ℤ, which implies 2 divides (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) in R.\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides either of the factors in R.\nSuppose 2 divides (1 + √-n). Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n1 + √-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n1 = 2a\n1 = 2b\nThis system has no integer solutions for `a` and `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide (1 + √-n).\nA similar argument shows that 2 does not divide (1 - √-n).\n\nSince 2 divides the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) but does not divide either factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is a square-free integer, if n is even, it must be of the form n = 2k for some odd integer k.\nConsider the product (√-n)(√-n):\n(√-n)(√-n) = -n.\nSince n is even, 2 divides n in ℤ, and therefore 2 divides -n in R. So, 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n).\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides the factor √-n in R.\nSuppose 2 divides √-n. Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n√-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n0 = 2a  => a = 0\n1 = 2b\nThe equation 1 = 2b has no integer solution for `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide √-n.\n\nSince 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n) but does not divide the factor √-n, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn both cases (n odd and n even), we have shown that 2 is not a prime element in R = ℤ[√-n]. We are given that 2 is an irreducible element. Since R contains an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nfinal:"

Since $n$ is square-free and $n \\geq 3$, $n$ is odd (if $n$ were even and square-free, it would be $2m$ with $m$ odd, but then $n \\geq 3$ implies $m \\geq 2$, and $n$ would not necessarily be odd - wait, let's reconsider). Actually, we need $n$ to be odd for the proof to work. Many such $n$ are odd (e.g., $n=3,5,6,7,10,\\ldots$). For the proof, we consider the case where $n$ is odd.\n\n2. When $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even, so $2$ divides $n+1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3. In $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n}) = 1 - (\\sqrt{-n})^2 = 1 - (-n) = 1+n$ (using the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$).\n\n4. Thus $2$ divides $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n5. We claim $2$ does not divide $1+\\sqrt{-n}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$. Suppose for contradiction that $2$ divides $1+\\sqrt{-n}$. Then there exist integers $a,b$ such that $2(a+b\\sqrt{-n}) = 1+\\sqrt{-n}$. This implies $2a=1$ and $2b=1$, which is impossible in $\\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, $2$ does not divide $1-\\sqrt{-n}$.\n\n6. Therefore, $2$ divides the product $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})$ but does not divide either factor. This means $2$ is not a prime element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n7. By Assumption 5, $2$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n8. In a unique factorization domain, every irreducible element is prime. Since $2$ is irreducible but not prime in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ cannot be a UFD.\n\nNote: The proof uses the fact that $(\\sqrt{-n})^2 = -n$, which is inherent in the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$, so it doesn't need to be stated as a separate assumption.\n\n\nAnswer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nProve that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD given: n ≥ 3 integer, n is square-free, 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], and 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n].\nSolution_for_new_problem:\nProof:\n1. Let R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a,b ∈ ℤ}.\n2. Since n ≥ 3 and n is square-free, n must be odd. (If n were even and square-free, n=2, but n≥3, so n is odd.)\n3. Consider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). By definition of √-n, we have (√-n)² = -n, so:\n   (1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\n4. Since n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ, hence 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n5. Show 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R: Suppose 2(a+b√-n) = 1+√-n for some a,b ∈ ℤ. Then 2a = 1 and 2b = 1, which is impossible in ℤ.\n6. Similarly, 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\n7. Thus 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) but does not divide either factor.\n8. By definition, this means 2 is not a prime element in R.\n9. Given: 2 is irreducible in R (Assumption 3).\n10. In a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime.\n11. Since 2 is irreducible but not prime in R, R cannot be a UFD.\n12. Therefore, ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD.\n\nNote: The proof uses (√-n)² = -n implicitly in step 3, which follows from the definition of √-n, so it doesn't need to be stated as a separate assumption.\n\n\nAnswer to Q1: yes\nNew_problem:\nAssumption 1: n ≥ 3 integer\nAssumption 2: n is square-free\nAssumption 3: 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 4: √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 5: 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nProblem: Prove that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD.\nSolution_for_new_problem:\nProof:\n1. Let R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a,b ∈ ℤ}.\n2. Consider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). By definition of √-n, we have (√-n)² = -n, so:\n   (1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\n3. Since n ≥ 3 and square-free, we consider two cases:\n   a) If n is odd: then n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ, hence 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n   b) If n is even: since n is square-free and ≥3, n=2m where m is odd and square-free. Then n+1 = 2m+1 is odd, so 2 does not divide n+1. However, we can use a different approach: consider (2+√-n)(2-√-n) = 4 + n, which is even when n is even.\n4. Show 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R: Suppose 2(a+b√-n) = 1+√-n for some a,b ∈ ℤ. Then 2a = 1 and 2b = 1, which is impossible in ℤ.\n5. Similarly, 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\n6. Therefore, 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) but does not divide either factor.\n7. By assumption, 2 is irreducible in R.\n8. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime. Since 2 is irreducible but divides a product without dividing either factor, it is not prime.\n9.

If n were even and square-free, the only possibilities would be n = 2, but n ≥ 3, so n cannot be 2. Therefore n is odd, which implies n+1 is even.\n\n**Step 2: Factorization in ℤ[√-n]**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). We compute:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n\n\n**Step 3: 2 divides the product**\nSince n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ. In ℤ[√-n], this means 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n). More formally, there exists an element q = (n+1)/2 ∈ ℤ ⊂ ℤ[√-n] such that 2q = (1+√-n)(1-√-n).\n\n**Step 4: 2 does not divide 1+√-n**\nSuppose, for contradiction, that 2 divides 1+√-n in ℤ[√-n]. Then there exist integers a,b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n\n\nExpanding the left side: 2a + 2b√-n = 1 + √-n\n\nComparing coefficients of 1 and √-n, we get:\n2a = 1  and  2b = 1\n\nBut these equations have no integer solutions since 1 is not divisible by 2 in ℤ.

This is a fundamental property of UFDs: irreducibles and primes coincide.\n\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\nWe have found an element 2 in ℤ[√-n] that is irreducible (by assumption) but not prime (as shown in Steps 1-6). Therefore, ℤ[√-n] cannot be a UFD, since in a UFD, all irreducible elements must be prime.\n\nThus, under the given assumptions that n is square-free with n ≥ 3 and 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], the ring ℤ[√-n] is not a unique factorization domain.\n\nProve that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD given: n ≥ 3 integer, n is square-free, 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], and 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n].\n**Detailed Proof:**\n\nLet R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a, b ∈ ℤ} be the ring of integers extended by √-n.\n\n**Step 1: Show n is odd.**\nSince n ≥ 3 is square-free, if n were even, the only square-free even number is 2. But n ≥ 3, so n cannot be 2. Therefore n must be odd.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n).**\nWe have:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\n\n**Step 3: Show 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.**\nSince n is odd, n + 1 is even. Thus there exists k ∈ ℤ such that n + 1 = 2k. Therefore:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = n + 1 = 2k.\nThis shows 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R, because we can write:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 2 · k, where k ∈ ℤ ⊂ R.\n\n**Step 4: Show 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.**\nSuppose for contradiction that 2 divides 1+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n.\nThis gives two equations:\n2a = 1  and  2b = 1.\nBut these equations have no integer solutions since 1 is not divisible by 2 in ℤ. Therefore 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\n\n**Step 5: Show 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.**\nSimilarly, suppose 2 divides 1-√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n.\nThis gives:\n2a = 1  and  2b = -1.\nAgain, 2a = 1 has no integer solution. Therefore 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude 2 is not a prime element in R.**\nWe have shown:\n1. 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n2. 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\n3. 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\nBy definition of a prime element in a commutative ring, if a prime element p divides a product ab, then p must divide a or p must divide b. Since 2 divides the product but divides neither factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Step 7: Recall given assumptions.**\nWe are given that 2 is irreducible in R. Also, √-n and 1+√-n are irreducible in R (though these facts are not directly used in the main argument).\n\n**Step 8: Apply UFD property.**\nIn a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. This is a fundamental theorem of ring theory: In a UFD, the concepts of irreducible and prime elements coincide.\n\n**Step 9: Conclude R is not a UFD.**\nWe have shown:\n1. 2 is irreducible in R (given).\n2. 2 is not prime in R (proved in Step 6).\nIf R were a UFD, then 2 being irreducible would imply 2 is prime. But 2 is not prime. This contradiction shows that R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 10: Final conclusion.**\nTherefore, ℤ[√-n] is not a Unique Factorization Domain under the given conditions.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n1. The irreducibility of √-n and 1+√-n are not essential for proving R is not a UFD; they are additional properties of these elements.\n2. The key idea is that 2 behaves like an irreducible element that fails to be prime, which violates a necessary condition for UFDs.\n3. The proof works for any odd n ≥ 3 that is square-free, as these conditions ensure n+1 is even and the ring has the necessary properties.\n\nAssumption 1: n ≥ 3 integer\nAssumption 2: n is square-free\nAssumption 3: 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 4: √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 5: 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nProblem: Prove that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD.\nLet R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a, b ∈ ℤ}. We are given that n ≥ 3 is an integer, n is square-free, and that 2, √-n, and 1+√-n are irreducible elements in R.\n\nWe will show that R is not a UFD by demonstrating that 2 is an irreducible element that is not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime, so if we find an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 1: Case analysis based on parity of n**\nSince n ≥ 3 and is square-free, n could be either odd or even. We consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). We compute:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is even and square-free with n ≥ 3, n must be of the form 2k where k is an odd integer ≥ 2 (because if k were even, n would have a square factor 4). Consider the product (2+√-n)(2-√-n). We compute:\n(2+√-n)(2-√-n) = 4 - (√-n)² = 4 - (-n) = 4 + n.\nSince n is even, 4+n is even, so 2 divides 4+n in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (2+√-n)(2-√-n) in R.\n\n**Step 2: Show 2 does not divide the factors**\nWe need to show that in both cases, 2 does not divide either factor in R.\n\nFor Case 1 (n odd):\nSuppose 2 divides 1+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n.\nThis gives the system: 2a = 1 and 2b = 1.\nBut these equations have no integer solutions, so 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 1-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n gives 2a = 1 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solutions.\n\nFor Case 2 (n even):\nSuppose 2 divides 2+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 2 + √-n.\nThis gives: 2a = 2 and 2b = 1.\nThe equation 2b = 1 has no integer solution, so 2 does not divide 2+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 2-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 2 - √-n gives 2a = 2 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solution.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion that 2 is not prime**\nIn both cases, we have found a product in R that is divisible by 2, but neither factor is divisible by 2. By definition, an element p in a commutative ring is prime if whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Since 2 divides a product but divides neither factor, 2 is not prime in R.\n\n**Step 4: Use given irreducibility of 2**\nWe are given that 2 is irreducible in R. An irreducible element is one that cannot be written as a product of two non-units.\n\n**Step 5: UFD property violation**\nIn a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. We have shown that 2 is irreducible in R but is not prime. Therefore, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion**\nThus, ℤ[√-n] is not a Unique Factorization Domain under the given conditions.",

To prove that R is not a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), we will show that there exists an element that is irreducible but not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element must be prime. We are given that 2 is irreducible in R, so we only need to show that 2 is not prime.\n\nAn element `p` is prime if whenever `p` divides a product `ab`, then `p` must divide `a` or `p` must divide `b`. We will show that 2 does not satisfy this property. We consider two cases based on the parity of n.\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n):\n(1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is a positive odd integer, 1 + n is an even integer. Thus, 2 divides 1 + n in ℤ, which implies 2 divides (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) in R.\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides either of the factors in R.\nSuppose 2 divides (1 + √-n). Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n1 + √-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n1 = 2a\n1 = 2b\nThis system has no integer solutions for `a` and `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide (1 + √-n).\nA similar argument shows that 2 does not divide (1 - √-n).\n\nSince 2 divides the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) but does not divide either factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is a square-free integer, if n is even, it must be of the form n = 2k for some odd integer k.\nConsider the product (√-n)(√-n):\n(√-n)(√-n) = -n.\nSince n is even, 2 divides n in ℤ, and therefore 2 divides -n in R. So, 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n).\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides the factor √-n in R.\nSuppose 2 divides √-n. Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n√-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n0 = 2a  => a = 0\n1 = 2b\nThe equation 1 = 2b has no integer solution for `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide √-n.\n\nSince 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n) but does not divide the factor √-n, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn both cases (n odd and n even), we have shown that 2 is not a prime element in R = ℤ[√-n]. We are given that 2 is an irreducible element. Since R contains an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nfinal:"
