    "Content":"I'm considering the ring $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, where $n\\ge 3$ and square free. I want to see why it's not a UFD. I defined a norm for the ring by $|a+b\\sqrt{-n}|=a^2+nb^2$. Using this I was able to show that $2$, $\\sqrt{-n}$ and $1+\\sqrt{-n}$ are all irreducible. Is there someway to conclude that $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ is not a UFD based on this? Thanks.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"If $n$ is even, then $2$ divides $\\sqrt{-n}^2=-n$ but does not divide $\\sqrt{-n}$, so $2$ is a nonprime irreducible. In a UFD, all irreducibles are prime, so this shows $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$ is not a UFD. Similarly, if $n$ is odd, then $2$ divides $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n})=1+n$ without dividing either of the factors, so again $2$ is a nonprime irreducible. This argument works equally well for $n=3$, but fails for $n=1,2$, and in fact $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-1}]$ and $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$ are UFDs.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user is asking why the ring ℤ[√-n] for n ≥ 3 and square-free is not a UFD, given that they've shown 2, √-n, and 1+√-n are irreducible. They used the norm a² + nb². \n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes a ring a UFD. A UFD requires that every element can be factored uniquely into irreducibles, up to units. So, if we can show that some element has two different factorizations into irreducibles, then it's not a UFD.\n\nIn their case, they have three irreducible elements: 2, √-n, and 1+√-n. Maybe they can multiply some of these to get a product that can also be factored differently. Let's think about the product of 2 and something else. \n\nWait, in similar problems, like with ℤ[√-5], which isn't a UFD, you have examples like 6 = 2×3 = (1+√-5)(1-√-5). Maybe here, there's a similar non-unique factorization. Let me see. \n\nIf n is square-free and ≥3, then n is odd or even? Since it's square-free and ≥3, n could be 3,5,6 (but wait, 6 is square-free?), no, 6 is 2×3, which is square-free. Wait, square-free means no square factors, so 6 is square-free. So n can be even or odd. But let's consider specific examples. Take n=3. Then ℤ[√-3]. But wait, ℤ[√-3] isn't the ring of integers of Q(√-3), which is actually ℤ[(1+√-3)\/2], but the problem states ℤ[√-n], so maybe even when n ≡3 mod 4, they are using ℤ[√-n] instead of the full ring of integers. Anyway, the user is considering ℤ[√-n], so we can work with that.\n\nIn ℤ[√-n], let's compute 1 + √-n multiplied by its conjugate, which is 1 - √-n. The product is (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1 + n. So 1 + n. Now, if n + 1 is even, which happens if n is odd. Since n ≥3 and square-free, n could be odd or even. Wait, n=6 is square-free and even. So if n is even, then n +1 is odd. If n is odd, n+1 is even. So in the case when n is odd, 1 + n is even, so 2 divides (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n). But 2 is irreducible. So maybe 2 divides either (1 + √-n) or (1 - √-n)? But 2 is a prime in UFD, but if the ring isn't a UFD, maybe 2 isn't prime. Wait, in a UFD, irreducible elements are prime. So if the ring were a UFD, then 2 would have to divide one of the factors. Let's check if 2 divides 1 + √-n in ℤ[√-n]. Suppose there exists a + b√-n such that 2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n. Then 2a = 1 and 2b = 1. But a and b must be integers, so this is impossible. Hence, 2 doesn't divide 1 + √-n or 1 - √-n. Therefore, in a UFD, if 2 divides the product, it must divide one of the factors, but since it doesn't, that would imply that 2 is not prime, hence the ring isn't a UFD. Wait, but maybe the user hasn't considered that 2 is irreducible but not prime. So in their ring, since 2 is irreducible but not prime (as it divides a product without dividing the factors), the ring can't be a UFD.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can show that 2 * something equals (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n), but if 1 + √-n and 1 - √-n are irreducible and different from 2, then this would give two different factorizations. Wait, let's take n=3. Then (1 + √-3)(1 - √-3) = 1 + 3 = 4. So 4 = 2*2. But 4 can also be written as (1 + √-3)(1 - √-3). So here, 2*2 and (1 + √-3)(1 - √-3) are two different factorizations. But 2 is irreducible, and 1±√-3 are also irreducible. Thus, 4 factors in two different ways, which would violate unique factorization. Therefore, ℤ[√-3] is not a UFD. Similarly, for other n, if n is odd, then 1 + n is even, so (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1 + n = 2*k, where k = (1 + n)\/2. If 2 divides this product but doesn't divide either factor, then 2 is not prime, hence the ring isn't a UFD. Alternatively, if 1 + n factors as 2*k, then 2*k = (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n). If 2 is irreducible and k is also irreducible (depending on n), then this gives a different factorization. For example, if n=5, then 1 + 5 = 6. So (1 + √-5)(1 - √-5) = 6 = 2*3. Here, 2 and 3 are irreducible in ℤ[√-5], and 1 ± √-5 are also irreducible. Thus, 6 has two different factorizations, so the ring isn't a UFD.\n\nBut the user mentioned n ≥3, square-free. So whether n is even or odd, this approach works? Let's check with n=6 (which is square-free). Then (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6) = 1 + 6 = 7. Hmm, 7 is prime. So 7 = 7*1, but that's not helpful. Wait, but 7 is prime in integers, but maybe in ℤ[√-6], 7 factors into irreducibles. But 7 is still prime here? Maybe not. Let me check. Suppose 7 = (a + b√-6)(c + d√-6). Then taking norms, 49 = (a² + 6b²)(c² + 6d²). So possible norms: 1*49, 7*7. If it factors non-trivially, then we need a² +6b² =7. Let's see: a²=1, 6b²=6 → b²=1. So a=±1, b=±1. Then (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6) =1 +6=7. Wait, but that's the same as before. So 7 factors as (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6). So if 7 is irreducible? Wait, the norm of 7 is 49. If 7 were reducible, it would have to factor into elements of norm 7. But does there exist an element with norm 7? a² +6b²=7. Possible if a=1, b=1: 1 +6=7. So yes, 1 + √-6 has norm 7. Therefore, 7 factors as (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6). Therefore, in ℤ[√-6], 7 is reducible. But wait, the original problem states that √-n is irreducible. For n=6, √-6 has norm 0² +6*1²=6, which is not a unit (since units have norm 1). So √-6 is irreducible. Similarly, 2: norm is 4. If 2 factors, it would have to be into elements of norm 2, but a² +6b²=2. Only possible if a=√2, which is not integer. So 2 is irreducible. Similarly, 1 + √-6 has norm 7, which is prime in ℤ, so if it factors, one factor must have norm 1, which is unit. Hence, 1 + √-6 is irreducible.\n\nSo in ℤ[√-6], 2*3 =6. But also, √-6 * √-6 = -6. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe other factorizations. For example, take the element 6. 6=2*3= (√-6)(-√-6). But here, √-6 is irreducible. So this gives two different factorizations? But 6 is not the same as 2*3, but perhaps 2*3 and √-6 * √-6 are different factorizations. However, 6 = 2*3 and also 6 = (-√-6)(√-6), but maybe that's considered the same up to units. Hmm, maybe not the best example.\n\nAlternatively, take n=7. Then (1 + √-7)(1 - √-7) =1 +7=8. So 8=2^3. So 2^3 vs (1 + √-7)(1 - √-7). If 2 is irreducible, and 1 ±√-7 are irreducible, then 8 has two different factorizations. But 2 is appearing three times here. But in this case, the problem is that 2 divides 8 = (1 + √-7)(1 - √-7) but doesn't divide either factor, hence 2 is not prime, so the ring isn't a UFD.\n\nWait, but the user's original problem states n ≥3 and square-free. So regardless of whether n is even or odd, as long as n ≥3, square-free, then this approach works. For even n, say n=6, the product (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6)=7, which is prime in integers, but factors in the ring as (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6). Wait, but 7 is not a multiple of 2 here, so maybe that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe when n is even, this approach doesn't work. Let me think.\n\nWait, if n is even, say n=6, then (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6)=7. So 7 is irreducible in integers, but factors here. But 7 isn't related to 2. But perhaps there's another element. Alternatively, consider 2*(something). For example, in n=6, 2 and √-6 are irreducible. Is there a product involving them that can be factored differently? Let's see, maybe 2*√-6 = 2√-6. Not sure. Alternatively, 2*3=6, and √-6 * √-6 = -6. But this introduces negative signs, which might be units. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in even n, the argument is different. Wait, the original user's question was for n≥3, square-free. So the problem is general. Maybe the key is to consider the element 2 and show that even though it's irreducible, it's not prime, hence the ring isn't a UFD. To show 2 is not prime, we need an example where 2 divides a product but doesn't divide either factor. For n odd: n=3,5,7 etc., then 1 + n is even, so (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1 + n = 2k. So 2 divides this product. But 2 doesn't divide either factor, as shown earlier. Hence, 2 is not prime, so the ring isn't a UFD. For n even: say n=6. Let's see. Take (1 + √-6)(1 - √-6)=7. 7 isn't divisible by 2. So that doesn't help. But maybe another product. Suppose we take 2*3=6. But 6 = (√-6)^2 * (-1). So 6 can be written as 2*3 or as (√-6)^2 * (-1). If 2 and 3 are irreducible, and √-6 is irreducible, then this gives different factorizations. However, the problem is that -1 is a unit, so maybe this isn't considered a different factorization. But in that case, 6 = 2*3 = (√-6)^2 * (-1). But unless 2 is associate to √-6, which they aren't (since units are ±1), this would be two different factorizations. Hence, unique factorization fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in even n, the elements 2 and √-n could lead to different factorizations. For example, in ℤ[√-6], 2 is irreducible, and √-6 is irreducible. Now, consider 2*3 = 6 = (√-6)^2. But 3 is also irreducible? Let's check. The norm of 3 is 9. If 3 factors, it would need to be into elements of norm 3. a² +6b²=3. The only solution is a=±√3, which isn't integer. So 3 is irreducible. Similarly, √-6 has norm 6, which is irreducible as well. So 2*3 and (√-6)^2 are two different factorizations of 6 into irreducibles. Hence, unique factorization fails, so the ring isn't a UFD.\n\nTherefore, whether n is even or odd, we can find such examples. For odd n, we use the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 2k, and for even n, we use 6 =2*3 = (√-6)^2. Hence, in both cases, the ring is not a UFD.\n\nSo the key point is that the existence of elements like 2, √-n, and 1 ±√-n which are irreducible but allow for multiple factorizations of the same element. Therefore, the problem reduces to showing that such non-unique factorizations exist, hence the ring can't be a UFD.\n\nIn the user's question, they have already shown that 2, √-n, and 1+√-n are irreducible. The next step is to show that these elements lead to a failure of unique factorization. Depending on whether n is even or odd, the example may vary. But since the problem states n ≥3 and square-free, we need a general approach.\n\nAssuming n is odd: Then 1 + n is even, so (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 2 * ((1 + n)\/2). If ((1 + n)\/2) is an integer (which it is since n is odd), then we can write this as 2 * k. Now, if k can be factored further, but since 2 is irreducible and k might also be irreducible, this gives us a product of two irreducibles equal to another product of two irreducibles (if 1 ±√-n are irreducible). But wait, if k is ((1 + n)\/2), maybe k is composite. For example, take n=5: ((1 +5)\/2)=3, which is irreducible. So then 6 = 2*3 = (1 + √-5)(1 - √-5), which are two different factorizations.\n\nIf n is even, then n=2m where m is square-free and odd (since n is square-free and even). Then, take the element 2 * m = 2m. But 2m = (√-n)^2 * (-1). For example, n=6: 2*3=6 = (√-6)^2 * (-1). Thus, two different factorizations.\n\nTherefore, regardless of parity, we can find such factorizations. Hence, the ring ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD because it lacks unique factorization, demonstrated by these examples.",

Actually, we need $n$ to be odd for the proof to work. Many such $n$ are odd (e.g., $n=3,5,6,7,10,\\ldots$). For the proof, we consider the case where $n$ is odd.\n\n2. When $n$ is odd, $n+1$ is even, so $2$ divides $n+1$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3. In $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $(1+\\sqrt{-n})(1-\\sqrt{-n}) = 1 - (\\sqrt{-n})^2 = 1 - (-n) = 1+n$ (using the definition of $\\sqrt{-n}$ as a square root of $-n$).\n\n4.

Let R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a,b ∈ ℤ}.\n2. Since n ≥ 3 and n is square-free, n must be odd. (If n were even and square-free, n=2, but n≥3, so n is odd.)\n3. Consider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n).

Since n ≥ 3 and square-free, we consider two cases:\n   a) If n is odd: then n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ, hence 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n   b) If n is even: since n is square-free and ≥3, n=2m where m is odd and square-free. Then n+1 = 2m+1 is odd, so 2 does not divide n+1. However, we can use a different approach: consider (2+√-n)(2-√-n) = 4 + n, which is even when n is even.\n4. Show 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R: Suppose 2(a+b√-n) = 1+√-n for some a,b ∈ ℤ. Then 2a = 1 and 2b = 1, which is impossible in ℤ.\n5. Similarly, 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\n6. Therefore, 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) but does not divide either factor.\n7. By assumption, 2 is irreducible in R.\n8. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime.

If n were even and square-free, the only possibilities would be n = 2, but n ≥ 3, so n cannot be 2. Therefore n is odd, which implies n+1 is even.\n\n**Step 2: Factorization in ℤ[√-n]**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). We compute:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n\n\n**Step 3: 2 divides the product**\nSince n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ. In ℤ[√-n], this means 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n). More formally, there exists an element q = (n+1)\/2 ∈ ℤ ⊂ ℤ[√-n] such that 2q = (1+√-n)(1-√-n).\n\n**Step 4: 2 does not divide 1+√-n**\nSuppose, for contradiction, that 2 divides 1+√-n in ℤ[√-n]. Then there exist integers a,b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n\n\nExpanding the left side: 2a + 2b√-n = 1 + √-n\n\nComparing coefficients of 1 and √-n, we get:\n2a = 1  and  2b = 1\n\nBut these equations have no integer solutions since 1 is not divisible by 2 in ℤ. This contradiction shows that 2 does not divide 1+√-n in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 5: 2 does not divide 1-√-n**\nSimilarly, suppose 2 divides 1-√-n. Then there exist integers a,b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n\n\nExpanding: 2a + 2b√-n = 1 - √-n\n\nComparing coefficients:\n2a = 1  and  2b = -1\n\nAgain, 2a = 1 has no integer solution, so 2 does not divide 1-√-n in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 6: 2 is not prime**\nWe have shown that:\n1. 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n)\n2. 2 does not divide 1+√-n\n3. 2 does not divide 1-√-n\n\nBy definition, an element p in an integral domain is prime if whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Since 2 divides the product but divides neither factor, 2 is not a prime element in ℤ[√-n].\n\n**Step 7: 2 is irreducible (given)**\nBy assumption, 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]. Recall that an element r is irreducible if r is nonzero, not a unit, and whenever r = xy, then either x or y is a unit.\n\n**Step 8: Contradiction with UFD properties**\nIn a unique factorization domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. This is a fundamental property of UFDs: irreducibles and primes coincide.\n\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\nWe have found an element 2 in ℤ[√-n] that is irreducible (by assumption) but not prime (as shown in Steps 1-6). Therefore, ℤ[√-n] cannot be a UFD, since in a UFD, all irreducible elements must be prime.\n\nThus, under the given assumptions that n is square-free with n ≥ 3 and 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], the ring ℤ[√-n] is not a unique factorization domain.\n\nProve that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD given: n ≥ 3 integer, n is square-free, 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n], and 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n].\n**Detailed Proof:**\n\nLet R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a, b ∈ ℤ} be the ring of integers extended by √-n.\n\n**Step 1: Show n is odd.**\nSince n ≥ 3 is square-free, if n were even, the only square-free even number is 2. But n ≥ 3, so n cannot be 2. Therefore n must be odd.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n).**\nWe have:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\n\n**Step 3: Show 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.**\nSince n is odd, n + 1 is even. Thus there exists k ∈ ℤ such that n + 1 = 2k. Therefore:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = n + 1 = 2k.\nThis shows 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R, because we can write:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 2 · k, where k ∈ ℤ ⊂ R.\n\n**Step 4: Show 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.**\nSuppose for contradiction that 2 divides 1+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n.\nThis gives two equations:\n2a = 1  and  2b = 1.\nBut these equations have no integer solutions since 1 is not divisible by 2 in ℤ. Therefore 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\n\n**Step 5: Show 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.**\nSimilarly, suppose 2 divides 1-√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that:\n2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n.\nThis gives:\n2a = 1  and  2b = -1.\nAgain, 2a = 1 has no integer solution. Therefore 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude 2 is not a prime element in R.**\nWe have shown:\n1. 2 divides the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n2. 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\n3. 2 does not divide 1-√-n in R.\nBy definition of a prime element in a commutative ring, if a prime element p divides a product ab, then p must divide a or p must divide b. Since 2 divides the product but divides neither factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Step 7: Recall given assumptions.**\nWe are given that 2 is irreducible in R. Also, √-n and 1+√-n are irreducible in R (though these facts are not directly used in the main argument).\n\n**Step 8: Apply UFD property.**\nIn a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. This is a fundamental theorem of ring theory: In a UFD, the concepts of irreducible and prime elements coincide.\n\n**Step 9: Conclude R is not a UFD.**\nWe have shown:\n1. 2 is irreducible in R (given).\n2. 2 is not prime in R (proved in Step 6).\nIf R were a UFD, then 2 being irreducible would imply 2 is prime. But 2 is not prime. This contradiction shows that R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 10: Final conclusion.**\nTherefore, ℤ[√-n] is not a Unique Factorization Domain under the given conditions.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n1. The irreducibility of √-n and 1+√-n are not essential for proving R is not a UFD; they are additional properties of these elements.\n2. The key idea is that 2 behaves like an irreducible element that fails to be prime, which violates a necessary condition for UFDs.\n3. The proof works for any odd n ≥ 3 that is square-free, as these conditions ensure n+1 is even and the ring has the necessary properties.\n\nAssumption 1: n ≥ 3 integer\nAssumption 2: n is square-free\nAssumption 3: 2 is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 4: √-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nAssumption 5: 1+√-n is irreducible in ℤ[√-n]\nProblem: Prove that ℤ[√-n] is not a UFD.\nLet R = ℤ[√-n] = {a + b√-n | a, b ∈ ℤ}. We are given that n ≥ 3 is an integer, n is square-free, and that 2, √-n, and 1+√-n are irreducible elements in R.\n\nWe will show that R is not a UFD by demonstrating that 2 is an irreducible element that is not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element is prime, so if we find an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 1: Case analysis based on parity of n**\nSince n ≥ 3 and is square-free, n could be either odd or even. We consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1+√-n)(1-√-n). We compute:\n(1+√-n)(1-√-n) = 1 - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is odd, n+1 is even, so 2 divides n+1 in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (1+√-n)(1-√-n) in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is even and square-free with n ≥ 3, n must be of the form 2k where k is an odd integer ≥ 2 (because if k were even, n would have a square factor 4). Consider the product (2+√-n)(2-√-n). We compute:\n(2+√-n)(2-√-n) = 4 - (√-n)² = 4 - (-n) = 4 + n.\nSince n is even, 4+n is even, so 2 divides 4+n in ℤ. Therefore, 2 divides (2+√-n)(2-√-n) in R.\n\n**Step 2: Show 2 does not divide the factors**\nWe need to show that in both cases, 2 does not divide either factor in R.\n\nFor Case 1 (n odd):\nSuppose 2 divides 1+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 1 + √-n.\nThis gives the system: 2a = 1 and 2b = 1.\nBut these equations have no integer solutions, so 2 does not divide 1+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 1-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 1 - √-n gives 2a = 1 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solutions.\n\nFor Case 2 (n even):\nSuppose 2 divides 2+√-n in R. Then there exist a, b ∈ ℤ such that 2(a + b√-n) = 2 + √-n.\nThis gives: 2a = 2 and 2b = 1.\nThe equation 2b = 1 has no integer solution, so 2 does not divide 2+√-n in R.\nSimilarly, if 2 divides 2-√-n, then 2(a + b√-n) = 2 - √-n gives 2a = 2 and 2b = -1, which also has no integer solution.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion that 2 is not prime**\nIn both cases, we have found a product in R that is divisible by 2, but neither factor is divisible by 2. By definition, an element p in a commutative ring is prime if whenever p divides a product ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Since 2 divides a product but divides neither factor, 2 is not prime in R.\n\n**Step 4: Use given irreducibility of 2**\nWe are given that 2 is irreducible in R. An irreducible element is one that cannot be written as a product of two non-units.\n\n**Step 5: UFD property violation**\nIn a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), every irreducible element is prime. We have shown that 2 is irreducible in R but is not prime. Therefore, R cannot be a UFD.\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion**\nThus, ℤ[√-n] is not a Unique Factorization Domain under the given conditions.",

To prove that R is not a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), we will show that there exists an element that is irreducible but not prime. In a UFD, every irreducible element must be prime. We are given that 2 is irreducible in R, so we only need to show that 2 is not prime.\n\nAn element `p` is prime if whenever `p` divides a product `ab`, then `p` must divide `a` or `p` must divide `b`. We will show that 2 does not satisfy this property. We consider two cases based on the parity of n.\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nConsider the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n):\n(1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) = 1² - (√-n)² = 1 - (-n) = 1 + n.\nSince n is a positive odd integer, 1 + n is an even integer. Thus, 2 divides 1 + n in ℤ, which implies 2 divides (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) in R.\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides either of the factors in R.\nSuppose 2 divides (1 + √-n). Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n1 + √-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n1 = 2a\n1 = 2b\nThis system has no integer solutions for `a` and `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide (1 + √-n).\nA similar argument shows that 2 does not divide (1 - √-n).\n\nSince 2 divides the product (1 + √-n)(1 - √-n) but does not divide either factor, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nSince n is a square-free integer, if n is even, it must be of the form n = 2k for some odd integer k.\nConsider the product (√-n)(√-n):\n(√-n)(√-n) = -n.\nSince n is even, 2 divides n in ℤ, and therefore 2 divides -n in R. So, 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n).\n\nNow, we check if 2 divides the factor √-n in R.\nSuppose 2 divides √-n. Then, there must exist an element `a + b√-n ∈ R` such that:\n√-n = 2(a + b√-n) = 2a + 2b√-n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get the system of equations:\n0 = 2a  => a = 0\n1 = 2b\nThe equation 1 = 2b has no integer solution for `b`. Therefore, 2 does not divide √-n.\n\nSince 2 divides the product (√-n)(√-n) but does not divide the factor √-n, 2 is not a prime element in R.\n\n**Conclusion**\nIn both cases (n odd and n even), we have shown that 2 is not a prime element in R = ℤ[√-n]. We are given that 2 is an irreducible element. Since R contains an irreducible element that is not prime, R cannot be a Unique Factorization Domain.\n\nfinal:"
