Since the sum of positive terms is positive, we have:\nΣ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) > 0\n\nIn particular, this implies:\n0 ≤ Σ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k))\n\nThis establishes the left inequality.\n\n**Part 2: Proving Σ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ 2 Σ_{n=N}^M 1/n^2**\n\nWe will prove this by bounding each inner sum and then summing over n.\n\n**Step 1: For fixed n, bound each term in the inner sum**\nFor fixed n ≥ N and any k ≥ 0, we have n + k ≥ n (since k ≥ 0).\nTherefore:\n1/(n(n+k)) ≤ 1/(n·n) = 1/n^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2^{-k} (which is positive), we get:\n(2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ (2^{-k})/n^2\n\n**Step 2: Sum the inequality over k**\nFor fixed n, summing the inequality from Step 1 over k from 0 to M-n:\nΣ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/n^2\n\nSince 1/n^2 is constant with respect to k, we can factor it out:\nΣ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ (1/n^2) Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} 2^{-k}\n\n**Step 3: Bound the geometric series sum**\nThe sum Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} 2^{-k} is a partial sum of the infinite geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 1/2.\nSince all terms are positive, this partial sum is less than or equal to the infinite sum:\nΣ_{k=0}^{M-n} 2^{-k} ≤ Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{-k}\n\nThe infinite geometric series Σ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{-k} converges to:\nΣ_{k=0}^∞ 2^{-k} = 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2\n\nTherefore:\nΣ_{k=0}^{M-n} 2^{-k} ≤ 2\n\n**Step 4: Combine Steps 2 and 3**\nFrom Step 2 and Step 3, we have:\nΣ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ (1/n^2) · 2 = 2/n^2\n\nThis inequality holds for each fixed n with N ≤ n ≤ M.\n\n**Step 5: Sum over n**\nNow summing both sides of the inequality from Step 4 over n from N to M:\nΣ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ Σ_{n=N}^M (2/n^2)\n\nSince 2 is constant, we can factor it out:\nΣ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ 2 Σ_{n=N}^M 1/n^2\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown both inequalities:\n1. 0 ≤ Σ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) (from Part 1)\n2. Σ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ 2 Σ_{n=N}^M 1/n^2 (from Part 2)\n\nTherefore, the complete inequality is proven:\n0 ≤ Σ_{n=N}^M Σ_{k=0}^{M-n} (2^{-k})/(n(n+k)) ≤ 2 Σ_{n=N}^M 1/n^2\n\nThis completes the proof.\nfinal:"
