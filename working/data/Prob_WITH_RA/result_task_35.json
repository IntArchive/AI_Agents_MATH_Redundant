    "AcceptedAnswer":"I'll do it with two vectors. I'll leave it to you do it in general. Suppose $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, respectively. Take a linear combination that is equal to $0$, $\\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1+\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$. We need to show that $\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=0$. Applying $T$ to both sides, we get\n$$\\mathbf{0} = T(\\mathbf{0}) = T(\\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1+\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2) = \\alpha_1\\lambda_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\alpha_2\\lambda_2\\mathbf{v}_2.$$\nNow, instead, multiply the original equation by $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\\mathbf{0} = \\lambda_1\\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\lambda_1\\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2.$$\nNow take the two equations,\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{0} &= \\alpha_1\\lambda_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\alpha_2\\lambda_2\\mathbf{v}_2\\\\\n\\mathbf{0} &= \\alpha_1\\lambda_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\alpha_2\\lambda_1\\mathbf{v}_2\n\\end{align*}$$\nand taking the difference, we get:\n$$\\mathbf{0} = 0\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\alpha_2(\\lambda_2-\\lambda_1)\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\alpha_2(\\lambda_2-\\lambda_1)\\mathbf{v}_2.$$ Since $\\lambda_2-\\lambda_1\\neq 0$, and since $\\mathbf{v}_2\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ (because $\\mathbf{v}_2$ is an eigenvector), then $\\alpha_2=0$. Using this on the original linear combination $\\mathbf{0} = \\alpha_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + \\alpha_2\\mathbf{v}_2$, we conclude that $\\alpha_1=0$ as well (since $\\mathbf{v}_1\\neq\\mathbf{0}$). So $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ are linearly independent. Now try using induction on $n$ for the general case.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly independent. Hmm, I remember this is a fundamental result in linear algebra. First, I need to recall the exact statement and the standard proof approach. \n\nSo, the problem is asking about eigenvectors from different eigenvalues being linearly independent. The key here is that each eigenvector comes from a distinct eigenvalue. The classic approach is to use induction. Let me think through the steps.\n\nSuppose we have eigenvectors v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ with corresponding distinct eigenvalues λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ. We need to show that any linear combination a₁v₁ + a₂v₂ + ... + aₙvₙ = 0 implies all aᵢ = 0.\n\nThe induction hypothesis would assume that any set of k eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues is linearly independent. Then, for k+1, assume a linear combination equals zero and apply the linear transformation (A - λ_{k+1}I) to both sides. This should eliminate the last term, leading to a contradiction unless all coefficients are zero. Wait, no, actually, applying (A - λ₁I)...(A - λₖI) might be another method. Or perhaps subtract scaled equations?\n\nAlternatively, another method is to consider a non-trivial linear combination with minimal number of terms, then apply the operator and subtract eigenvalues times the combination, leading to a contradiction because the eigenvalues are distinct. This might reduce the number of terms, contradicting minimality.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the original problem's exact wording, so I need to structure their question into the required format. The original question was: \"How can I prove that if I have n eigenvectors from different eigenvalues, they are all linearly independent?\" So the assumptions here are that each eigenvector is associated with a distinct eigenvalue, and they are eigenvectors of some linear operator. The problem is to prove their linear independence.\n\nSo, in the Assumption section, each line should list one property. So first, each eigenvector corresponds to a distinct eigenvalue. Also, the context is linear algebra, so we assume we're dealing with a vector space and a linear operator. But maybe the user didn't specify, so I need to check if the original problem mentions any specific conditions, like the field being algebraically closed or the operator being linear. The original question doesn't specify, so I shouldn't add extra assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions are:\n\n- There are n eigenvectors.\n- Each eigenvector corresponds to a distinct eigenvalue.\n\nProblem: Prove that these n eigenvectors are linearly independent.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, the assumption included \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So in that example, the user had to list each assumption line by line, even if they seem basic. So here, the key assumptions are that we have eigenvectors (each from different eigenvalues) and the eigenvalues are distinct. Each eigenvector is associated with exactly one eigenvalue, and all eigenvalues are distinct. But how to split into separate lines.\n\nMaybe:\n\nAssumption:\nEach vector is an eigenvector,\nEach eigenvector corresponds to a distinct eigenvalue.\n\nBut the original problem states \"eigenvectors from different eigenvalues\", so perhaps the problem already implies that each eigenvector is associated with a different eigenvalue. But to be precise, in the assumption section, each line should address one property. So perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nEach of the n vectors is an eigenvector,\nEach eigenvector corresponds to a unique eigenvalue,\nAll eigenvalues are distinct.\n\nWait, \"unique eigenvalue\" might be redundant if \"all eigenvalues are distinct\" is stated. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe vectors are eigenvectors of a linear operator,\nEach eigenvector corresponds to a different eigenvalue.\n\nBut the original problem might not specify the operator, so maybe the assumptions should just be about the eigenvectors and their eigenvalues. Let me check the example again. The example had:\n\nOriginal problem's formatted assumption:\n$n$ is an integer,\n$n$ is divisible by 7.\n\nSo each assumption is a separate line. So in the eigenvectors case:\n\nAssumption:\nEach vector is an eigenvector,\nThe eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors are all distinct.\n\nSo each of these is a separate assumption. Therefore, in the problem, the user wants to prove that under these conditions, the eigenvectors are linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nEach vector is an eigenvector,\nThe eigenvalues corresponding to each eigenvector are distinct.\nProblem:\nProve that the n eigenvectors are linearly independent.\n\nWait, but the problem statement in the example was \"Prove that [expression] is divisible by 91.\" So here, the problem should state \"Prove that the eigenvectors are linearly independent.\"\n\nYes.
