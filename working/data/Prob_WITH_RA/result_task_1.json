    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. First, I need to identify the assumptions and the problem statement.\n\nThe original question is about proving the limit of sin(x)\/x as x approaches 0 equals 1. The user mentions avoiding Taylor series and prefers a geometrical solution. Also, it's noted that this is homework related to proving the continuity of sine.\n\nSo, the main problem is to prove the limit. The assumptions here would be the conditions given in the problem. The problem states x approaches 0, and the method should be geometric without Taylor series. Also, the context is proving continuity of sin, but that might be part of the problem's application rather than an assumption. \n\nWait, the assumptions in the example included specific conditions on n. Here, the key assumptions are that x approaches 0, the function is sin(x)\/x, and the method shouldn't use Taylor series. But the problem statement itself is the limit. The user also mentions it's for proving continuity of sin, but that's part of the problem's motivation, not an assumption. \n\nSo, in the assumption section, maybe list that x is approaching 0, and the method should be geometric (not using Taylor series). But the example's assumptions were more about the variables. Hmm. Let me check the example again. In the example, assumptions were that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So here, perhaps the assumption is that x is approaching 0, and the solution must not use Taylor series. But the original problem doesn't state that x is real, but maybe that's implicit. Wait, the problem is about a standard calculus limit, so x is a real variable approaching 0. The key constraints here are the method (geometric, no Taylor) and the context (homework, proving continuity of sin). But the example's assumptions were about the variables' properties. So perhaps the assumptions here would be:\n\n- x is a real number approaching 0.\n- The solution must not use Taylor series expansions of sin, cos, or tan.\n- The proof should be geometric in nature.\n\nBut the problem statement is to prove the limit. So structuring that. Let me make sure each assumption is a single property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption: x is a real number,\nx approaches 0,\nThe proof does not use Taylor series of sine, cosine, or tangent,\nThe proof is geometric.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$\\lim_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}=1.$$\n\nYes, that seems to fit. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one condition. The problem is the actual statement to prove. The original question mentions it's homework related to continuity of sin, but that's more context, not an assumption. The example included the divisibility by 7 as an assumption, which was part of the problem's condition. Here, the conditions are the method constraints (no Taylor, geometric) and the variable approaching 0. So that should be the structured problem.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\n\n**Problem:**\nProve that lim_{x→0} sin(x)\/x = 1, given the inequality (1\/2)tan(x) ≥ (1\/2)x ≥ (1\/2)sin(x) for x in a neighborhood of 0.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  **Simplify the given inequality:**\n    Start with the given inequality: (1\/2)tan(x) ≥ (1\/2)x ≥ (1\/2)sin(x).\n    Multiplying all parts by 2, we get: tan(x) ≥ x ≥ sin(x).\n\n2.  **Case 1: x approaches 0 from the right (x → 0⁺):**\n    For x in a small interval (0, ε), sin(x) > 0. We can divide the inequality by sin(x) without changing the direction of the inequalities:\n    tan(x)\/sin(x) ≥ x\/sin(x) ≥ 1\n    Since tan(x) = sin(x)\/cos(x), this simplifies to:\n    1\/cos(x) ≥ x\/sin(x) ≥ 1\n    Taking the reciprocal of all parts reverses the inequalities:\n    cos(x) ≤ sin(x)\/x ≤ 1\n\n3.  **Case 2: x approaches 0 from the left (x → 0⁻):**\n    Let x = -y, where y > 0. As x → 0⁻, y → 0⁺.\n    The expression becomes:\n    sin(x)\/x = sin(-y)\/(-y)\n    Using the identity sin(-y) = -sin(y), we get:\n    (-sin(y))\/(-y) = sin(y)\/y\n    Therefore, the inequality cos(y) ≤ sin(y)\/y ≤ 1 holds for y → 0⁺. This means the bounds are the same for x approaching 0 from the left.\n\n4.  **Apply the Squeeze Theorem:**\n    We have established the bounds cos(x) ≤ sin(x)\/x ≤ 1 for all x in a neighborhood of 0 (excluding x=0).\n    We know the limits of the bounding functions:\n    lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1\n    lim_{x→0} 1 = 1\n    Since sin(x)\/x is squeezed between two functions that both approach 1 as x approaches 0, by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit of sin(x)\/x must also be 1.\n    lim_{x→0} sin(x)\/x = 1\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nfinal:\n**Problem:**\nProve that lim_{x→0} sin(x)\/x = 1.\n\n**Proof:**\nWe are given the inequality (1\/2)tan(x) ≥ (1\/2)x ≥ (1\/2)sin(x) for x near 0.\n\n1.  First, simplify the inequality by multiplying all parts by 2:\n    tan(x) ≥ x ≥ sin(x)\n\n2.  Consider the case for x > 0. In a small interval (0, π\/2), sin(x) is positive. We can divide the entire inequality by sin(x):\n    tan(x)\/sin(x) ≥ x\/sin(x) ≥ 1\n    (sin(x)\/cos(x))\/sin(x) ≥ x\/sin(x) ≥ 1\n    1\/cos(x) ≥ x\/sin(x) ≥ 1\n\n3.  Taking the reciprocal of all parts reverses the direction of the inequalities:\n    cos(x) ≤ sin(x)\/x ≤ 1\n\n4.  Now, consider the case for x < 0. Let x = -y where y > 0. The expression sin(x)\/x becomes:\n    sin(-y)\/(-y) = -sin(y)\/(-y) = sin(y)\/y\n    Since y > 0, the inequality from step 3 applies to y: cos(y) ≤ sin(y)\/y ≤ 1. As cos(y) = cos(-x) = cos(x), the inequality cos(x) ≤ sin(x)\/x ≤ 1 holds for x < 0 as well.\n\n5.  We can now apply the Squeeze Theorem. We know the limits of the outer functions:\n    lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1\n    lim_{x→0} 1 = 1\n\n6.  Since sin(x)\/x is bounded between two functions that both approach 1 as x approaches 0, the limit of sin(x)\/x must also be 1.\n    lim_{x→0} sin(x)\/x = 1",
