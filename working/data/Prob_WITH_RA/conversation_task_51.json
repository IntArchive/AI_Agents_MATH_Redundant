Prove that C_b(X), the space of bounded continuous functions from X to ℝ equipped with the supremum norm ‖f‖_∞ = sup_{x∈X} |f(x)|, is a complete metric space.\n\n**Proof:**\nTo prove that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is a complete metric space, we must show that every Cauchy sequence in C_b(X) converges to a limit that is also in C_b(X).\n\nLet (f_n) be a Cauchy sequence in C_b(X).\n\n**1. Pointwise Convergence**\nFor any fixed x ∈ X, the sequence of real numbers (f_n(x)) is a Cauchy sequence because:\n|f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ sup_{y∈X} |f_m(y) - f_n(y)| = ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence in the sup norm, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for m, n ≥ N, ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε, which implies |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε.\nSince ℝ is a complete metric space, the Cauchy sequence (f_n(x)) converges for every x ∈ X. We can thus define a function f: X → ℝ by:\nf(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)\n\nWe now need to show that this limit function f is in C_b(X) and that f_n converges to f in the sup norm. This requires proving that f is bounded, f is continuous, and the convergence is uniform.\n\n**2. Uniform Convergence (f_n → f in the sup norm)**\nLet ε > 0. Since (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an integer N such that for all m, n ≥ N:\n‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/2\nThis means that for all x ∈ X, |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2.\nNow, let's fix n ≥ N and take the limit as m → ∞ in the inequality above. For any x ∈ X:\nlim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |lim_{m→∞} f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |f(x) - f_n(x)|\nSince the inequality |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2 holds for all m ≥ N, we have:\n|f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε\nThis inequality is valid for all n ≥ N and for every x ∈ X. Therefore, we can take the supremum over all x ∈ X:\n‖f - f_n‖_∞ = sup_{x∈X} |f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε\nThis holds for all n ≥ N, which proves that the sequence (f_n) converges to f uniformly.\n\n**3. The limit function f is bounded**\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, it is a bounded sequence. This means there exists a constant M > 0 such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n ∈ ℕ.\nFor any x ∈ X, we have:\n|f(x)| = |lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)| = lim_{n→∞} |f_n(x)|\nSince |f_n(x)| ≤ ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n, it follows that:\n|f(x)| ≤ M\nAs this holds for all x ∈ X, the function f is bounded, with ‖f‖_∞ ≤ M.\n\n**4. The limit function f is continuous**\nWe need to show that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. Let x₀ ∈ X be an arbitrary point. We want to show f is continuous at x₀.\nLet ε > 0.\nFrom the uniform convergence (Step 2), we know there exists an integer N such that:\n‖f_N - f‖_∞ < ε/3\nSince f_N ∈ C_b(X), it is continuous at x₀. Thus, there exists a neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U:\n|f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3\nNow, for any x ∈ U, we use the triangle inequality:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| = |f(x) - f_N(x) + f_N(x) - f_N(x₀) + f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\n≤ |f(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| + |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\nWe can bound each term:\n- |f(x) - f_N(x)| ≤ ‖f - f_N‖_∞ < ε/3\n- |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3 (by continuity of f_N)\n- |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)| ≤ ‖f_N - f‖_∞ < ε/3\nCombining these, we get:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε\nThis shows that f is continuous at x₀. Since x₀ was arbitrary, f is continuous on X.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that the pointwise limit function f is bounded (Step 3) and continuous (Step 4), which means f ∈ C_b(X). We have also shown that the convergence f_n → f is uniform (Step 2), which means ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0.\nTherefore, every Cauchy sequence (f_n) in C_b(X) converges to a limit f in C_b(X). This proves that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is a complete metric space.\n\nfinal:"

Prove that C_b(X), the space of bounded continuous functions from X to ℝ equipped with the supremum norm ‖f‖_∞ = sup_{x∈X} |f(x)|, is a complete metric space.\n\n**Proof:**\nTo prove that (C_b(X), ‖·‖_∞) is a complete metric space, we must show that every Cauchy sequence in C_b(X) converges to a limit that is also in C_b(X).\n\nLet (f_n) be a Cauchy sequence in C_b(X).\n\n**1. Pointwise Convergence**\nFor any fixed x ∈ X, the sequence of real numbers (f_n(x)) is a Cauchy sequence because:\n|f_m(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ sup_{y∈X} |f_m(y) - f_n(y)| = ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence in the sup norm, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for m, n ≥ N, ‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε, which implies |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε.\nSince ℝ is a complete metric space, the Cauchy sequence (f_n(x)) converges for every x ∈ X. We can thus define a function f: X → ℝ by:\nf(x) = lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)\n\nWe now need to show that this limit function f is in C_b(X) and that f_n converges to f in the sup norm. This requires proving that f is bounded, f is continuous, and the convergence is uniform.\n\n**2. Uniform Convergence (f_n → f in the sup norm)**\nLet ε > 0. Since (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an integer N such that for all m, n ≥ N:\n‖f_m - f_n‖_∞ < ε/2\nThis means that for all x ∈ X, |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2.\nNow, let's fix n ≥ N and take the limit as m → ∞ in the inequality above. For any x ∈ X:\nlim_{m→∞} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |lim_{m→∞} f_m(x) - f_n(x)| = |f(x) - f_n(x)|\nSince the inequality |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| < ε/2 holds for all m ≥ N, we have:\n|f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε\nThis inequality is valid for all n ≥ N and for every x ∈ X. Therefore, we can take the supremum over all x ∈ X:\n‖f - f_n‖_∞ = sup_{x∈X} |f(x) - f_n(x)| ≤ ε/2 < ε\nThis holds for all n ≥ N, which proves that the sequence (f_n) converges to f uniformly.\n\n**3. The limit function f is bounded**\nSince (f_n) is a Cauchy sequence, it is a bounded sequence. This means there exists a constant M > 0 such that ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n ∈ ℕ.\nFor any x ∈ X, we have:\n|f(x)| = |lim_{n→∞} f_n(x)| = lim_{n→∞} |f_n(x)|\nSince |f_n(x)| ≤ ‖f_n‖_∞ ≤ M for all n, it follows that:\n|f(x)| ≤ M\nAs this holds for all x ∈ X, the function f is bounded, with ‖f‖_∞ ≤ M.\n\n**4. The limit function f is continuous**\nWe need to show that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous. Let x₀ ∈ X be an arbitrary point. We want to show f is continuous at x₀.\nLet ε > 0.\nFrom the uniform convergence (Step 2), we know there exists an integer N such that:\n‖f_N - f‖_∞ < ε/3\nSince f_N ∈ C_b(X), it is continuous at x₀. Thus, there exists a neighborhood U of x₀ such that for all x ∈ U:\n|f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3\nNow, for any x ∈ U, we use the triangle inequality:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| = |f(x) - f_N(x) + f_N(x) - f_N(x₀) + f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\n≤ |f(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| + |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)|\nWe can bound each term:\n- |f(x) - f_N(x)| ≤ ‖f - f_N‖_∞ < ε/3\n- |f_N(x) - f_N(x₀)| < ε/3 (by continuity of f_N)\n- |f_N(x₀) - f(x₀)| ≤ ‖f_N - f‖_∞ < ε/3\nCombining these, we get:\n|f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε\nThis shows that f is continuous at x₀. Since x₀ was arbitrary, f is continuous on X.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have shown that the pointwise limit function f is bounded (Step 3) and continuous (Step 4), which means f ∈ C_b(X). We have also shown that the convergence f_n → f is uniform (Step 2), which means ‖f_n - f‖_∞ → 0.\nTherefore, every Cauchy sequence (f_n) in C_b(X) converges to a limit f in C_b(X).
