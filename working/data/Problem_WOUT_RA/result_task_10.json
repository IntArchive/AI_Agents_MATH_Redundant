    "AcceptedAnswer":"Assuming you mean $e^{ix}=\\cos x+i\\sin x$, one way is to use the MacLaurin series for sine and cosine, which are known to converge for all real $x$ in a first-year calculus context, and the MacLaurin series for $e^z$, trusting that it converges for pure-imaginary $z$ since this result requires complex analysis. The MacLaurin series:\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin x&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}=x-\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n\\cos x&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}x^{2n}=1-\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\ne^z&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{z^n}{n!}=1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2!}+\\frac{z^3}{3!}+\\cdots\n\\end{align} Substitute $z=ix$ in the last series:\n\\begin{align}\ne^{ix}&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(ix)^n}{n!}=1+ix+\\frac{(ix)^2}{2!}+\\frac{(ix)^3}{3!}+\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n&=1+ix-\\frac{x^2}{2!}-i\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+i\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n&=1-\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots +i\\left(x-\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\\right)\n\\\\\\\\\n&=\\cos x+i\\sin x\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original question is about proving Euler's formula: e^{it} = cos t + i sin t. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" For Euler's formula, the main assumption is that t is a real number because Euler's formula relates complex exponentials to trigonometric functions with real arguments. Also, the formula uses the exponential function, which in this context is defined for complex numbers, but the exponent here is purely imaginary. So the key assumption is that t is a real variable.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the user wants the problem restated. The original question is straightforward: \"Prove Euler's formula: e^{it} = cos t + i sin t.\" There are no additional conditions mentioned in the question, so the only assumption is that t is a real number. \n\nWait, but sometimes Euler's formula can be introduced using power series expansions. Do I need to mention any assumptions about the convergence of the series or the differentiability? The example given didn't include such details, so maybe not. The problem is to prove the formula as stated, so the primary assumption is about the domain of t. Therefore, the assumption should be that t is a real number. \n\nSo, structuring it as per the format:\n\nAssumption: t is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that e^{it} = cos t + i sin t.\n\nThat should be it. The example didn't have multiple assumptions unless the problem required them. Since Euler's formula is a general statement for real t, that's the only assumption needed here. I don't see any other conditions or objects involved in the problem statement. The user didn't specify any particular constraints or methods to use, so the assumptions are minimal.",

The integrand $e^{-x^2}$ is a continuous function.\n\n**Question:** Is there a redundant assumption among the given assumptions?\n\n**Answer to Q1 (from previous analysis):** No.\n\n**Proof:**\nThe problem asks to identify if there is a redundant assumption among the two given assumptions. A redundant assumption is one that can be logically derived from the other given assumptions.\n\n1.  **Assumption 1:** \"The integral is evaluated over the interval $[0, \\\\infty)$\".\n2.  **Assumption 2:** \"The integrand $e^{-x^2}$ is a continuous function\".\n\nLet's analyze if one can be deduced from the other:\n\n*   **Can Assumption 2 be derived from Assumption 1?** The interval of integration ($[0, \\\\infty)$) specifies the domain over which the integral is computed. It provides no information about the properties (like continuity) of the function being integrated. Therefore, the continuity of $e^{-x^2}$ cannot be derived solely from the interval of integration.\n*   **Can Assumption 1 be derived from Assumption 2?** The continuity of the integrand $e^{-x^2}$ describes a property of the function itself. It does not define or imply the specific interval over which this function is to be integrated. A continuous function can be integrated over any valid interval. Therefore, the interval $[0, \\\\infty)$ cannot be derived solely from the continuity of the integrand.\n\nSince neither assumption can be logically derived from the other, both assumptions are independent and necessary for the problem as stated. Assumption 1 defines the limits of integration, which is fundamental to the problem. Assumption 2 ensures that the integral is well-defined in the Riemann or Lebesgue sense, as continuity is a sufficient condition for integrability.\n\nTherefore, there is no redundant assumption among the given assumptions.\n\nProof: True\nfinal:\nProblem Statement:\nEvaluate the definite integral $\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-x^2} dx$ given the following assumptions:\n1.
