            "text": "**Step 4: Checking if disjointness is implied by other assumptions**\nCould A ∩ B = ∅ be deduced from A compact, B closed, and something else? No, compactness and closedness don't imply disjointness. For example, in ℝ: A = [0,1] (compact), B = [0.5,2] (closed), they intersect but are both compact/closed.\n\n**Step 5: Checking if closedness of B is necessary**\nIf B is not closed, the result might fail. Example: In ℝ, A = {0} (compact), B = {1/n: n ∈ ℕ} (not closed, its closure includes 0). Then A ∩ B = ∅, but d(A,B) = inf{1/n} = 0.\n\n**Step 6: Checking if compactness of A is necessary**\nIf A is not compact, the result might fail. Example: In ℝ, A = ℕ (closed but not compact), B = {n + 1/n: n ∈ ℕ} (closed). They're disjoint but d(A,B) = inf{1/n} = 0.\n\nSo all assumptions seem necessary. But let me re-examine the notation issue: The problem uses |α - β| instead of d(α,β). This might indicate X = ℝ (or ℝⁿ). In that case, \"X is a metric space\" is true but weaker than necessary. The stronger assumption would be \"X = ℝ\" or \"X is a normed space\".\n\nActually, if X is just a metric space, |α - β| doesn't make sense unless we interpret it as d(α,β). So the notation |α - β| might be a slight abuse of notation meaning d(α,β).\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion about redundancy**\nI don't see any redundant assumption. All are necessary for the proof. The notation issue doesn't make any assumption redundant.\n\nLet me check if \"X is a metric space\" could be weakened. The proof uses: continuity of distance function, which requires metric space structure. So that's necessary.\n\nTherefore, there is no redundant assumption.\n\n**Step 8: Final answer**\nBased on my analysis, there is no redundant assumption.
