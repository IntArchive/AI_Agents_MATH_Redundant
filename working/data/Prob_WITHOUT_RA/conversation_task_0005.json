Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\n2. Exponentiation and roots (including rational powers)\n3. Standard transcendental functions: trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.), inverse trigonometric functions, exponential functions (e^x), and logarithmic functions (ln x)\n4. Composition of the above operations and functions\n\nFormally, the set of elementary functions is the smallest set containing:\n- Constant functions\n- The identity function f(x) = x\n- Exponential function e^x\n- Natural logarithm function ln x\n- Trigonometric functions sin x, cos x, etc.\n- Inverse trigonometric functions arcsin x, arccos x, etc.\n- And closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, composition, and algebraic operations (taking roots, etc.)\n\n**Step 2: Definition of Closed-Form Integral**\n\nA closed-form integral (or closed-form antiderivative) of a function f(x) is defined as an expression F(x) such that:\n1. F'(x) = f(x) for all x in some domain\n2. F(x) can be expressed as a finite combination of elementary functions\n3. The expression for F(x) involves only a finite number of operations and function compositions\n\nThe key aspect is that the antiderivative must be expressible using a finite combination of the elementary functions listed in Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Logical Implication from Definitions**\n\nFrom the definitions established in Steps 1 and 2, we can directly deduce:\n- If an integral ∫f(x)dx has a closed-form solution F(x), then by definition (Step 2), F(x) must be expressible as a finite combination of elementary functions.\n- Since f(x) is given to be an elementary function (by assumption), we are considering the integral of an elementary function.\n- The statement \"a closed-form integral is defined as an expression composed of elementary functions\" follows tautologically from the definition in Step 2.\n\n**Step 4: Reference to Liouville's Theorem**\n\nTo provide deeper mathematical context, we reference Liouville's theorem on integration in finite terms (1833-1841). Liouville's theorem characterizes when an elementary function has an elementary antiderivative. The theorem states:\n\nIf f(x) is an elementary function, then ∫f(x)dx is elementary (i.e., has a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions) if and only if f(x) can be expressed in a specific form involving logarithmic derivatives of elementary functions.\n\nLiouville's theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an elementary function to have an elementary antiderivative. This theorem justifies why some elementary functions (like e^x) have elementary antiderivatives, while others (like e^(-x²)) do not.\n\n**Step 5: Examples and Counterexamples**\n\nTo illustrate the concept:\n\n1. **Example of closed-form integral (elementary antiderivative):**\n   ∫e^x dx = e^x + C\n   Here, e^x is elementary, and its antiderivative e^x + C is also elementary.\n\n2. **Example of closed-form integral (elementary antiderivative):**\n   ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n   Both sin(x) and -cos(x) are elementary functions.\n\n3. **Counterexample (no elementary antiderivative):**\n   ∫e^(-x²) dx\n   The function e^(-x²) is elementary, but its antiderivative cannot be expressed as a finite combination of elementary functions. This is proven using Liouville's theorem.\n\n4. **Counterexample (no elementary antiderivative):**\n   ∫sin(x²) dx\n   This is another example of an elementary function whose antiderivative is not elementary.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nThe statement \"a closed-form integral is defined as an expression composed of elementary functions\" is essentially a definition rather than a theorem to be proved. However, we have:\n\n1. Precisely defined what constitutes elementary functions (Step 1)\n2. Defined what constitutes a closed-form integral (Step 2)\n3. Shown that by definition, a closed-form integral must be composed of elementary functions (Step 3)\n4. Referenced Liouville's theorem which provides the theoretical foundation for understanding which elementary functions have elementary antiderivatives (Step 4)\n5. Provided examples to illustrate both cases where elementary functions do and do not have elementary antiderivatives (Step 5)\n\nTherefore, we have established that the definition of a closed-form integral inherently requires it to be expressible in terms of elementary functions. This is not a theorem that requires proof in the traditional sense, but rather a definition that we have clarified and justified through mathematical context and examples.\n\n**Final Remark:** It's important to note that while all closed-form integrals (by definition) are composed of elementary functions, not all elementary functions have closed-form integrals. Liouville's theorem provides the criterion for determining which elementary functions have elementary antiderivatives.",
