    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given integral problem into the specified format. First, I need to extract the assumptions and the problem statement from the Math Stack Exchange question.\n\nLooking at the original problem: It's an integral from 0 to 1 of the function ln(1 + (ln²x)\/(4π²)) multiplied by ln(1-x)\/x dx, and it's supposed to equal -π² times (4ζ'(-1) + 2\/3). The task is to prove this equality.\n\nNow, for assumptions. The integral is definite from 0 to 1. The integrand involves natural logarithms, with variables x in the logs. The function inside the integral is composed of two logarithmic terms multiplied together. The problem doesn't state any explicit conditions, but since it's an integral from 0 to 1, we need to consider the behavior at the endpoints.\n\nPotential assumptions: The integral is taken over the interval [0,1], which is an assumption about the limits of integration. The integrand is defined as the product of two logarithmic functions divided by x. However, at x=0 and x=1, there might be convergence issues. For example, ln(1-x) approaches -infinity as x approaches 1, but divided by x, which is 1 there, so the behavior is ln(1-x) ~ -(1-x) near 1, which is integrable. Similarly, near x=0, ln²x\/(4π²) becomes large, but inside the ln(1 + ...), so maybe that term approaches ln(1 + something large), but multiplied by ln(1-x)\/x. Wait, as x approaches 0, ln(1-x)\/x ~ -x\/x = -1, so that term tends to -1. The other part, ln(1 + (ln²x)\/(4π²)). As x approaches 0, ln x approaches -infinity, so (ln²x)\/(4π²) is positive and large, so ln(1 + large) ~ ln(ln²x\/(4π²)) ~ 2 ln |ln x| - ln(4π²). So the integrand near 0 behaves like (2 ln |ln x| - ln(4π²)) * (-1). The integral of ln |ln x| near 0... I think that converges because the integral of ln |ln x| dx near 0 might be handled via substitution, but regardless, the problem states the integral exists and equals the given value. So perhaps the main assumptions are about the integral being convergent and the functions being integrable over [0,1].\n\nBut the problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions; it's just to prove the equality. So maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral being from 0 to 1 and the integrand as given. However, sometimes in such problems, there might be implicit assumptions like the integral converges, or that the functions involved are integrable. But in the example given by the user, the assumption was about n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, there's no variable parameter like n; it's a definite integral. So perhaps the only assumption is that the integral is taken over [0,1], and the integrand is as defined. But the problem doesn't state any restrictions, so maybe there are no explicit assumptions. Wait, but the example included assumptions even if they weren't stated in the original problem. Wait, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) divisible by 91 for every integer n. The user formatted it with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, it's for every integer n, but the formatted problem added that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Wait, no, looking back: the original example's problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that contradicts the original problem. Wait, perhaps the example had a mistake, but the user wants me to follow the example. Wait, maybe in the example, the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted problem corrected it. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. Wait, perhaps the original problem in the example was stated as \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would mean that the problem as formatted is actually a corrected version, perhaps the original problem had a missing condition. But maybe the user wants me to list all the assumptions from the problem, but sometimes the problem may not state them explicitly, so I need to infer.\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nOriginal problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting. If the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\", that's adding a condition not present in the original. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, or maybe the original problem had a typo. Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect. But regardless, the user wants me to structure the problem as in their example. So in their example, they included assumptions even if they weren't in the original problem. Wait, perhaps they extracted assumptions from context. For example, 91 is 7*13, so maybe the problem requires n to be divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, only divisible by 7 is listed. Hmm, that example might not be accurate, but perhaps I should proceed with the current problem.\n\nBack to the current problem: The integral from 0 to1 of ln(1 + (ln²x)\/(4π²)) * [ln(1-x)\/x] dx equals -π²(4ζ’(-1) + 2\/3). The problem is to prove this equality.\n\nAssumptions here: The integral is over [0,1]. The integrand is as given. But do we need to state that the integral converges? The problem states to prove the equality, so it's assumed that the integral exists. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- The integral is taken over the interval [0,1].\n- The integrand is defined as ln(1 + (ln²x)\/(4π²)) * (ln(1-x)\/x).\n\nBut wait, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is evaluated from 0 to 1,\nThe integrand is $\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{\\ln^2x}{4\\pi^2}\\right)\\frac{\\ln(1-x)}{x}$,\nThe integral converges.\n\nBut the problem might not mention convergence, but since it's given as an equality, we assume it converges. Alternatively, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the integral bounds and the integrand. The example didn't include convergence as an assumption but included conditions on n. So perhaps in this case, the only assumptions are the limits of integration and the integrand's form. But the example included two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So for this integral problem, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval $[0, 1]$,\nThe integrand is $\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{\\ln^2x}{4\\pi^2}\\right)\\frac{\\ln(1-x)}{x}$.\n\nBut in the example, the problem had a mistake where the original said \"for every integer n\" but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". So maybe in their example, they corrected the problem. So perhaps in this case, we need to list all necessary conditions, even if implicit. But since the problem is to prove the equality, and the integral is given as convergent, perhaps the main assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand's form. So I'll list those.",

Let's compute:\nK(a,u) = ∫_{0}^{∞} (t² e^{-at}\/(1+ut²)) dt\n\nAlternatively, we can differentiate a known integral. Consider:\nF(a) = ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-at} arctan(t) dt\nWe know ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-at} arctan(t) dt = (1\/a)[Ci(a) sin(a) - (π\/2 - Si(a)) cos(a)]\nwhere Ci and Si are cosine and sine integrals.\n\nSince d\/dt [ln(1+t²)] = 2t\/(1+t²), and arctan(t) = ∫_{0}^{t} 1\/(1+s²) ds,\nthere's a relationship via integration by parts.\n\nActually, a more direct approach: Use the formula:\n∫_{0}^{∞} ln(1+t²) e^{-at} dt = (2\/a)[γ + ln(a) - Ci(a) cos(a) - Si(a) sin(a)]\nwhere γ is Euler's constant.\n\nThis is a known integral formula.
