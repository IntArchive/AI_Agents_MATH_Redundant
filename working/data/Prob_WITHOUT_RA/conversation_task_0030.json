        "mathematician and proof writer": "Assumption:\nAssumption 1: Real numbers adhere to the distributive property\nAssumption 2: Every real number has an additive inverse\nAssumption 3: Multiplication is commutative\nProblem:\nProve that Division by a non-zero real number is valid\nWe aim to prove that division by a non-zero real number is valid. That is, for any real numbers a and b with b ≠ 0, there exists a unique real number c such that a = b × c.\n\nStep 1: Definition of division\nFor real numbers a and b with b ≠ 0, we define a ÷ b (or a/b) as the real number c that satisfies the equation a = b × c.\n\nStep 2: Existence of multiplicative inverse\nFirst, we prove that for any non-zero real number b, there exists a real number b⁻¹ such that b × b⁻¹ = 1.\nConsider the equation b × x = 1. We need to show this equation has a solution. Using the given properties:\n- Since b ≠ 0, we can consider the expression (1/b) as a candidate, but we must prove its existence constructively.\n- Alternatively, we can use the fact that real numbers form a field (implicit from the given assumptions). The existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements is a field axiom, but we can derive it from the given properties if we assume the real numbers satisfy all field axioms.\n\nGiven the assumptions provided (distributive property, existence of additive inverses, and commutativity of multiplication), along with the implicit assumption that real numbers satisfy the other field axioms (associativity of addition and multiplication, existence of additive and multiplicative identities, etc.), we can assert that for each non-zero b, there exists b⁻¹ with b × b⁻¹ = 1.\n\nStep 3: Using field properties to show b⁻¹ exists\nMore formally, in a field (which ℝ is), the multiplicative inverse exists for every non-zero element by definition. The given assumptions are part of the field axioms. To be precise, a field is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) satisfying:\n1. Associativity of addition and multiplication\n2. Commutativity of addition and multiplication (given)\n3. Distributive property (given)\n4. Existence of additive identity (0) and multiplicative identity (1)\n5. Existence of additive inverses (given)\n6. Existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements\nThus, from the field structure of ℝ, we conclude that for b ≠ 0, ∃ b⁻¹ ∈ ℝ such that b × b⁻¹ = 1.\n\nStep 4: Solving b × x = 1\nGiven b ≠ 0, the equation b × x = 1 has a solution because ℝ is a field. Specifically, x = b⁻¹ is the solution.\n\nStep 5: Uniqueness of multiplicative inverse\nWe prove uniqueness: If b × x = 1 and b × y = 1, then x = y.\nProof: Suppose b × x = 1 and b × y = 1. Then:\nb × x = b × y\nMultiply both sides by b⁻¹ (which exists by Step 2):\nb⁻¹ × (b × x) = b⁻¹ × (b × y)\nUsing associativity: (b⁻¹ × b) × x = (b⁻¹ × b) × y\nSince b⁻¹ × b = 1 (by definition of multiplicative inverse):\n1 × x = 1 × y\nThus x = y.\nTherefore, the multiplicative inverse is unique.\n\nStep 6: Definition of c for division\nFor given a and b (b ≠ 0), define c = a × b⁻¹, where b⁻¹ is the unique multiplicative inverse of b.\n\nStep 7: Verification that c satisfies a = b × c\nCompute b × c:\nb × c = b × (a × b⁻¹)\nBy commutativity of multiplication: = b × (b⁻¹ × a)\nBy associativity: = (b × b⁻¹) × a\nSince b × b⁻¹ = 1: = 1 × a = a\nThus, b × c = a, so c satisfies the definition of a ÷ b.\n\nStep 8: Uniqueness of c\nWe prove that if b × c₁ = a and b × c₂ = a, then c₁ = c₂.\nProof: Suppose b × c₁ = a and b × c₂ = a. Then:\nb × c₁ = b × c₂\nMultiply both sides by b⁻¹:\nb⁻¹ × (b × c₁) = b⁻¹ × (b × c₂)\nUsing associativity: (b⁻¹ × b) × c₁ = (b⁻¹ × b) × c₂\nSince b⁻¹ × b = 1: 1 × c₁ = 1 × c₂\nThus c₁ = c₂.\nTherefore, the solution c to b × c = a is unique.\n\nStep 9: Existence and uniqueness conclusion\nFor any real numbers a and b with b ≠ 0, there exists a unique real number c = a × b⁻¹ such that a = b × c.\n\nStep 10: Validity of division\nSince for every a and b (b ≠ 0) we can find a unique c satisfying a = b × c, division by non-zero real numbers is well-defined and valid. The quotient a ÷ b is precisely c = a × b⁻¹.\n\nThus, we have proven that division by a non-zero real number is valid, using the given assumptions (distributive property, existence of additive inverses, commutativity of multiplication) along with the implicit field structure of real numbers.",
