Consider the subring of constant polynomials in R[x], which is isomorphic to R. Under φ, the image of this subring is a subring of S[x]. We claim this image consists of constant polynomials in S[x]. To see this, note that an element f ∈ R[x] is constant if and only if for every g ∈ R[x], we have fg = gf (since constants commute with all polynomials). This property is preserved under isomorphism. Therefore, φ maps the subring of constant polynomials in R[x] isomorphically onto the subring of constant polynomials in S[x]. Since the constant subring of R[x] is isomorphic to R and the constant subring of S[x] is isomorphic to S, we conclude R ≅ S. More formally: Let C_R = {r ∈ R[x] : r is constant} ≅ R and C_S = {s ∈ S[x] : s is constant} ≅ S. Since φ is an isomorphism, φ(C_R) is a subring of S[x]. For any r ∈ C_R and any g ∈ R[x], we have rg = gr. Applying φ, we get φ(r)φ(g) = φ(g)φ(r) for all φ(g) ∈ S[x]. This means φ(r) commutes with all elements of S[x], which implies φ(r) is in the center of S[x]. The center of S[x] consists of constant polynomials (since S is commutative if we're considering commutative rings, or more generally, the center consists of constants from the center of S). Thus φ(C_R) ⊆ C_S. By symmetry, φ^{-1}(C_S) ⊆ C_R. Hence φ restricts to an isomorphism C_R ≅ C_S, so R ≅ S.\"\n}\n```"
