    "Content":"If $n>1$ is an integer, then $\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^n \\frac1k$ is not an integer. If you know Bertrand's Postulate , then you know there must be a prime $p$ between $n\/2$ and $n$, so $\\frac 1p$ appears in the sum, but $\\frac{1}{2p}$ does not. Aside from $\\frac 1p$, every other term $\\frac 1k$ has $k$ divisible only by primes smaller than $p$. We can combine all those terms to get $\\sum_{k=1}^n\\frac 1k = \\frac 1p + \\frac ab$, where $b$ is not divisible by $p$. If this were an integer, then (multiplying by $b$) $\\frac bp +a$ would also be an integer, which it isn't since $b$ isn't divisible by $p$. Does anybody know an elementary proof of this which doesn't rely on Bertrand's Postulate? For a while, I was convinced I'd seen one, but now I'm starting to suspect whatever argument I saw was wrong.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Hint $ $ There is a $\\rm\\color{darkorange}{unique}$ denominator $\\rm\\,\\color{#0a0} {2^K}$ having maximal power of $\\:\\!2,\\,$ so scaling by $\\rm\\,\\color{#c00}{2^{K-1}}$ we deduce a contradiction $\\large \\rm\\, \\frac{1}2 = \\frac{c}d \\,$ with odd $\\rm\\,d \\:$ (vs. $\\,\\rm d = 2c),\\,$ e.g. $$\\begin{eqnarray} & &\\rm\\ \\ \\ \\  \\color{0a0}{m}  &=&\\ \\  1 &+& \\frac{1}{2} &+& \\frac{1}{3} &+&\\, \\color{#0a0}{\\frac{1}{4}} &+& \\frac{1}{5} &+& \\frac{1}{6} &+& \\frac{1}{7} \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\ &\\rm\\ \\ \\color{#c00}{2}\\:\\!m &=&\\ \\ 2 &+&\\ 1 &+& \\frac{2}{3} &+&\\, \\color{#0a0}{\\frac{1}{2}} &+& \\frac{2}{5} &+& \\frac{1}{3} &+& \\frac{2}{7}^\\phantom{M^M}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\ & -\\color{#0a0}{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ \\ &=&\\ \\ 2 &+&\\ 1 &+& \\frac{2}{3} &-&\\rm \\color{#c00}{2}\\:\\!m  &+& \\frac{2}{5} &+& \\frac{1}{3} &+& \\frac{2}{7}^\\phantom{M^M}\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ All denom's in the prior fractions are odd so they sum to fraction with odd denom $\\rm\\,d\\, |\\, 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$ . Note $ $ Said $\\rm\\color{darkorange}{uniqueness}$ has easy proof: if $\\rm\\:j\\:\\! 2^K$ is in the interval $\\rm\\,[1,n]\\,$ then so too is $\\,\\rm \\color{#0a0}{2^K}\\! \\le\\, j\\:\\!2^K.\\,$ But if $\\,\\rm j\\ge 2\\,$ then the interval contains $\\rm\\,2^{K+1}\\!= 2\\cdot\\! 2^K\\! \\le  j\\:\\!2^K,\\,$ contra maximality of $\\,\\rm K$ . The argument is more naturally expressed using valuation theory, but I purposely avoided that because Anton requested an \"elementary\" solution. The above proof can easily be made comprehensible to a high-school student. Generally we can similarly prove that a sum of fractions is nonintegral if the highest power of  a prime $\\,p\\,$ in any denominator occurs in $\\rm\\color{darkorange}{exactly\\ one}$ denominator, e.g. see the Remark here where I explain how it occurs in a trickier multiplicative form (from a contest problem). In valuation theory, this is a special case of a basic result on the valuation of a sum (sometimes called the \"dominance lemma\" or similar).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions in the problem. The original question is about proving that the harmonic series sum from k=1 to n of 1\/k is never an integer when n>1. The user mentions Bertrand's Postulate but asks for an elementary proof without it. \n\nLooking at the problem statement, the key assumptions are:\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n is greater than 1.\n\nThe problem is to prove that the sum is not an integer. The example given in the original question includes assumptions about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So following that structure, here the assumptions should be n is an integer and n>1. I need to list each assumption on a separate line, each addressing one property for one object. \n\nWait, the original problem says \"If n>1 is an integer\", so the two conditions are n is an integer and n>1. These are separate assumptions. The problem is to show the sum isn't an integer. So in the formatted version, the assumptions are n is an integer and n > 1. Then the problem statement is the sum from k=1 to n of 1\/k is never an integer. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other hidden assumptions. The user is asking for a proof that doesn't rely on Bertrand's Postulate, but that's part of the question's context, not the problem's assumptions. The formatted problem should only include the conditions given for the problem itself, not the method of proof. So the answer should list the two assumptions and then the problem statement as given.",
