Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$.

Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 > ",

an unbounded domain.\n- Problem: Prove that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$.

an unbounded domain.\n- Problem: Prove that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 >\nStep 1) Fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$. Construct $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as: $f(x) = |x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log(1/|x|))^{-2/p_0}$ for $0 < |x| < 1/e$, $f(x) = |x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2/p_0}$ for $|x| > e$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nStep 2) Verify $f \\in L^{p_0}$: Near 0, substitute $u = \\log(1/|x|)$ to show $\\int_{|x|<1/e} |f|^{p_0} < \\infty$. Near infinity, substitute $u = \\log|x|$ to show $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^{p_0} < \\infty$.\n\nStep 3) For $q > p_0$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int |x|^{-q/p_0} (\\text{log term})^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ has a non-integrable singularity at 0, so $f \\notin L^q$.\n\nStep 4) For $q < p_0$: $q/p_0 < 1$, so $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ decays too slowly at infinity, making $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^q$ diverge. Thus $f \\notin L^q$.\n\nStep 5) Therefore $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q \\neq p_0$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded, completing the proof."

Substitute $u = \\\\log(1/r)$, so $r = e^{-u}$, $dr = -e^{-u} du$, and when $r$ goes from $0$ to $1/e$, $u$ goes from $\\\\infty$ to $1$.

Wait, there is a mistake: For convergence at infinity, we need the integrand to decay sufficiently fast. Actually, $|x|^{-1}$ gives $r^{-1}$ in radial integration, and $r^{n-1} \\\\cdot r^{-1} = r^{n-2}$. For large $r$, $r^{n-2}$ grows if $n > 2$, so the integral diverges. This suggests our construction needs adjustment for dimensions $n \\\\geq 2$.\\n\\nLet us instead work in one dimension ($\\\\mathbb{R}$) to avoid dimensional complications. In one dimension:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int_{|x|>e} |x|^{-1} (\\\\log|x|)^{-2} \\\\, dx = 2 \\\\int_e^{\\\\infty} x^{-1} (\\\\log x)^{-2} \\\\, dx.\\n\\\\]\\nSubstitute $u = \\\\log x$, $du = dx/x$, giving\\n\\\\[\\n2 \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} u^{-2} \\\\, du = 2 \\\\left[ -u^{-1} \\\\right]_1^{\\\\infty} = 2.\\n\\\\]\\nThus the integral converges. Similarly, near 0:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int_{|x|<1/e} |x|^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{|x|}\\\\right)^{-2} \\\\, dx = 2 \\\\int_0^{1/e} x^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right)^{-2} \\\\, dx.\\n\\\\]\\nWith $u = \\\\log(1/x)$, $du = -dx/x$, we get\\n\\\\[\\n2 \\\\int_{\\\\infty}^{1} u^{-2} (-du) = 2 \\\\int_1^{\\\\infty} u^{-2} \\\\, du = 2.\\n\\\\]\\nHence $\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}} |f|^{p_0} = 4 < \\\\infty$, so $f \\\\in L^{p_0}$.\\n\\n**Step 2: Show $f \\\\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$.**\\nTake $q > p_0$ and consider $\\\\int |f|^q$. Near 0, for $0 < |x| < 1/e$,\\n\\\\[\\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} \\\\left(\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{|x|}\\\\right)^{-2q/p_0}.\\n\\\\]\\nSince $q/p_0 > 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ has a singularity at 0 that is not integrable in any neighborhood of 0. More precisely, for small $x$,\\n\\\\[\\n|x|^{-q/p_0} \\\\left(\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{|x|}\\\\right)^{-2q/p_0} \\\\sim |x|^{-q/p_0} \\\\cdot (\\\\text{slowly varying factor}),\\n\\\\]\\nand $\\\\int_0^{\\\\delta} x^{-\\\\alpha} \\\\, dx$ diverges for $\\\\alpha \\\\geq 1$. Here $\\\\alpha = q/p_0 > 1$, so the integral diverges. Therefore $\\\\int_{|x|<1/e} |f|^q = \\\\infty$, and consequently $f \\\\notin L^q$.\\n\\n**Step 3: Show $f \\\\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.**\\nTake $q < p_0$. Now examine the behavior at infinity. For $|x| > e$,\\n\\\\[\\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} (\\\\log|x|)^{-2q/p_0}.\\n\\\\]\\nSince $q/p_0 < 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ decays too slowly. Indeed,\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int_e^{\\\\infty} x^{-q/p_0} (\\\\log x)^{-2q/p_0} \\\\, dx\\n\\\\]\\ndiverges because $x^{-q/p_0}$ with exponent less than 1 is not integrable at infinity (compare with $\\\\int^\\\\infty x^{-\\\\beta} dx$, which converges only for $\\\\beta > 1$). The logarithmic factor does not alter this divergence. Hence $\\\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^q = \\\\infty$, and $f \\\\notin L^q$.\\n\\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\\nWe have constructed a function $f$ defined on the unbounded domain $\\\\mathbb{R}$ such that:\\n- $f \\\\in L^{p_0}$ (Step 1),\\n- $f \\\\notin L^q$ for any $q > p_0$ (Step 2),\\n- $f \\\\notin L^q$ for any $q < p_0$ (Step 3).\\nThus $f$ belongs to $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, namely $p = p_0$. Since $p_0$ was arbitrary in $[1, \\\\infty)$, the statement is proved.\\n\\n**Remark:** The construction works in one dimension. For higher dimensions $\\\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can adjust the exponents appropriately (using $|x|^{-n/p_0}$ instead of $|x|^{-1/p_0}$ to account for the radial integration factor $r^{n-1}$) and follow a similar argument.\"\n}\n```\n###END_OF_FORMAT###",

an unbounded domain.\n- Problem: Prove that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 >\nWe prove the statement by explicit construction. Fix any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$. We will construct a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (an unbounded domain) such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q \\neq p_0$ with $q \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Construction:** Define\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n|x|^{-1/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2/p_0}, & 0 < |x| < \\frac{1}{e}, \\\\\n|x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2/p_0}, & |x| > e, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe domain $\\mathbb{R}$ is clearly unbounded.\n\n**Step 1: Verify $f \\in L^{p_0}$.**\nWe compute $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |f(x)|^{p_0} \\, dx$ by splitting into two regions.\n\n*Near 0:* For $0 < |x| < 1/e$, we have\n\\[\n|f(x)|^{p_0} = |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2}.\n\\]\nUsing polar coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or simply in one dimension, but the argument generalizes), the integral near 0 becomes\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|<1/e} |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx = C_n \\int_0^{1/e} r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{-2} \\, dr,\n\\]\nwhere $C_n$ is the surface area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Substitute $u = \\log(1/r)$, so $r = e^{-u}$, $dr = -e^{-u} du$, and when $r$ goes from $0$ to $1/e$, $u$ goes from $\\infty$ to $1$. Then\n\\[\n\\int_0^{1/e} r^{n-2} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{-2} \\, dr = \\int_{\\infty}^{1} e^{-(n-2)u} u^{-2} (-e^{-u}) du = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{-(n-1)u} u^{-2} \\, du.\n\\]\nSince $e^{-(n-1)u}$ decays exponentially and $u^{-2}$ is integrable at infinity, this integral converges.\n\n*Near infinity:* For $|x| > e$, we have\n\\[\n|f(x)|^{p_0} = |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2}.\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|>e} |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2} \\, dx = C_n \\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr = C_n \\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-2} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr.\n\\]\nSubstitute $u = \\log r$, so $r = e^u$, $dr = e^u du$, and\n\\[\n\\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-2} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{(n-2)u} u^{-2} e^u du = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{(n-1)u} u^{-2} \\, du.\n\\]\nThis integral diverges because $e^{(n-1)u}$ grows exponentially. Wait, there is a mistake: For convergence at infinity, we need the integrand to decay sufficiently fast. Actually, $|x|^{-1}$ gives $r^{-1}$ in radial integration, and $r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} = r^{n-2}$. For large $r$, $r^{n-2}$ grows if $n > 2$, so the integral diverges. This suggests our construction needs adjustment for dimensions $n \\geq 2$.\n\nLet us instead work in one dimension ($\\mathbb{R}$) to avoid dimensional complications. In one dimension:\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|>e} |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2} \\, dx = 2 \\int_e^{\\infty} x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} \\, dx.\n\\]\nSubstitute $u = \\log x$, $du = dx/x$, giving\n\\[\n2 \\int_1^{\\infty} u^{-2} \\, du = 2 \\left[ -u^{-1} \\right]_1^{\\infty} = 2.\n\\]\nThus the integral converges. Similarly, near 0:\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|<1/e} |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx = 2 \\int_0^{1/e} x^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx.\n\\]\nWith $u = \\log(1/x)$, $du = -dx/x$, we get\n\\[\n2 \\int_{\\infty}^{1} u^{-2} (-du) = 2 \\int_1^{\\infty} u^{-2} \\, du = 2.\n\\]\nHence $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |f|^{p_0} = 4 < \\infty$, so $f \\in L^{p_0}$.\n\n**Step 2: Show $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$.**\nTake $q > p_0$ and consider $\\int |f|^q$. Near 0, for $0 < |x| < 1/e$,\n\\[\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2q/p_0}.\n\\]\nSince $q/p_0 > 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ has a singularity at 0 that is not integrable in any neighborhood of 0. More precisely, for small $x$,\n\\[\n|x|^{-q/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2q/p_0} \\sim |x|^{-q/p_0} \\cdot (\\text{slowly varying factor}),\n\\]\nand $\\int_0^{\\delta} x^{-\\alpha} \\, dx$ diverges for $\\alpha \\geq 1$. Here $\\alpha = q/p_0 > 1$, so the integral diverges. Therefore $\\int_{|x|<1/e} |f|^q = \\infty$, and consequently $f \\notin L^q$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.**\nTake $q < p_0$. Now examine the behavior at infinity. For $|x| > e$,\n\\[\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2q/p_0}.\n\\]\nSince $q/p_0 < 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ decays too slowly. Indeed,\n\\[\n\\int_e^{\\infty} x^{-q/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2q/p_0} \\, dx\n\\]\ndiverges because $x^{-q/p_0}$ with exponent less than 1 is not integrable at infinity (compare with $\\int^\\infty x^{-\\beta} dx$, which converges only for $\\beta > 1$). The logarithmic factor does not alter this divergence. Hence $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^q = \\infty$, and $f \\notin L^q$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nWe have constructed a function $f$ defined on the unbounded domain $\\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n- $f \\in L^{p_0}$ (Step 1),\n- $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q > p_0$ (Step 2),\n- $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q < p_0$ (Step 3).\nThus $f$ belongs to $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, namely $p = p_0$. Since $p_0$ was arbitrary in $[1, \\infty)$, the statement is proved.\n\n**Remark:** The construction works in one dimension. For higher dimensions $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can adjust the exponents appropriately (using $|x|^{-n/p_0}$ instead of $|x|^{-1/p_0}$ to account for the radial integration factor $r^{n-1}$) and follow a similar argument."

that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 >",

an unbounded domain.\n- Problem: Prove that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 >\nStep 1) Fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$. Construct $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ as: $f(x) = |x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log(1/|x|))^{-2/p_0}$ for $0 < |x| < 1/e$, $f(x) = |x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2/p_0}$ for $|x| > e$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise.\n\nStep 2) Verify $f \\in L^{p_0}$: Near 0, substitute $u = \\log(1/|x|)$ to show $\\int_{|x|<1/e} |f|^{p_0} < \\infty$. Near infinity, substitute $u = \\log|x|$ to show $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^{p_0} < \\infty$.\n\nStep 3) For $q > p_0$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int |x|^{-q/p_0} (\\text{log term})^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ has a non-integrable singularity at 0, so $f \\notin L^q$.\n\nStep 4) For $q < p_0$: $q/p_0 < 1$, so $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ decays too slowly at infinity, making $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^q$ diverge. Thus $f \\notin L^q$.\n\nStep 5) Therefore $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q \\neq p_0$. The domain $\\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded, completing the proof.",

an unbounded domain.\n- Problem: Prove that there exists a function which is in $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe assumption \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually **redundant**. Here's why:\n\n1. The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties.\n2. We can construct such a function on *any* domain (bounded or unbounded).\n3. The key property is about $L^p$ membership, which depends on integrability conditions.\n4. On a bounded domain, if we want a function to be in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, we need to be careful because of the inclusion relationships: on bounded domains, $L^q \\subset L^p$ when $q > p$.\n5. However, we can still construct such functions even on bounded domains by making them blow up appropriately.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The standard examples of functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ typically use unbounded domains. For example, $f(x) = x^{-a}$ on $(0, \\infty)$ is in $L^p$ if and only if $ap > 1$. So by choosing $a$ appropriately, we can get $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$.\n\nBut wait, the assumption says \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" - this is part of the problem statement, not an assumption we need to use in the proof. The problem is asking us to prove existence, and we can choose any domain we want for our construction.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The assumption is given as part of the problem setup. It says \"Assumption 1: The function is defined on an unbounded domain.\" This is telling us that we're considering functions on unbounded domains. Then the problem asks us to prove existence of such a function.\n\nSo the assumption is **not redundant** - it's specifying the type of functions we're considering. Without it, we could construct examples on bounded domains too, but the problem specifically wants an example on an unbounded domain.\n\nHowever, I think there's a subtlety: The problem asks to prove *existence* of a function with certain properties. We get to choose the function. We can choose a function defined on an unbounded domain. So the assumption that \"the function is defined on an unbounded domain\" is actually part of what we need to prove - we need to exhibit a function defined on an unbounded domain that has the $L^p$ property.\n\nTherefore, this assumption is **not redundant** - it's part of the conclusion we need to establish. We need to find a function that is both:\n1. Defined on an unbounded domain\n2. In $L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$\n\nSince there's only one assumption and it's necessary for the problem statement, there is **no redundant assumption**.\n\nLet me construct the proof to confirm:\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p}$ for $x \\geq 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $p > 1$ is fixed.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-q/p} dx$.\nThis converges if and only if $q/p > 1$, i.e., $q > p$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ if and only if $q > p$.\nBut we need $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nActually, with this construction, $f \\notin L^p$ either (since $q=p$ gives $\\int_1^\\infty x^{-1} dx = \\infty$).\n\nBetter example: $f(x) = x^{-a}$ for $x \\geq 1$, where $a > 0$.\nThen $\\int_1^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_1^\\infty x^{-ap} dx$ converges iff $ap > 1$, i.e., $p > 1/a$.\nSo if we fix $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, choose $a = 1/p_0$, then $f \\in L^p$ iff $p > p_0$.\nBut we want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, not for all $p > p_0$.\n\nActually, the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, and 0 otherwise.\nCheck: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^p dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = \\int_1^\\infty u^{-2} du < \\infty$ (substitution $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, the $x^{-q/p}$ term dominates and the integral converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int_e^\\infty |f(x)|^q dx = \\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, the integral diverges (like $\\int^\\infty x^{-c} dx$ with $c < 1$).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the actual known example:\n\nThe standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for large $x$.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays fast enough.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int |f|^q = \\int x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, $x^{-q/p}$ decays too slowly.\n\nActually, this shows $f \\in L^p$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p$. But what about $q > p$? We need to check if $f \\in L^q$ for $q > p$.\n\nFor $q > p$, $q/p > 1$, so $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$ converges because $x^{-q/p}$ decays faster than any power with exponent > 1.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one $p$.\n\nThe correct construction is more subtle. Actually, I recall that on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can construct functions in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ by combining different behaviors at 0 and infinity.\n\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ near 0 and $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ near infinity, with appropriate $a,b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$: $\\int |f|^p = \\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ap} dx + \\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-bp} dx$.\nThe first integral converges iff $ap < n$ (or $ap < n$ for convergence near 0).\nThe second converges iff $bp > n$ (or $bp > n$ for convergence at infinity).\nSo we need $n/b < p < n/a$.\nIf we choose $a$ and $b$ such that $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, then there's exactly one $p$ satisfying both conditions: $p = n/a$.\n\nBut if $a = b$, then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $p < n/a$ and $p > n/a$, which is impossible.\n\nWe need $n/b < n/a$, i.e., $a < b$. Then there's an interval of $p$ values: $(n/b, n/a)$.\nTo have exactly one $p$, we need this interval to be empty or a single point, which requires $n/b \\geq n/a$, i.e., $a \\geq b$.\n\nActually, let me think differently. We want $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$. This means:\n1. $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$\n2. $\\int |f|^q = \\infty$ for all $q \\neq p$\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-1}$ for $x$ large.\nFor $q = p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p} dx$. This converges if $p > 1$ (since $\\int^\\infty u^{-p} du$ with $u = \\log x$).\nFor $q > p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $\\int^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-q} dx$. Since $q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill not working.\n\nActually, I think the standard example is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} (\\log x)^{-2/p}$ for $x \\geq e$, extended appropriately.\nCheck $L^p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} dx = [-(\\log x)^{-1}]_e^\\infty = 1 < \\infty$.\nFor $q > p$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-q/p} (\\log x)^{-2q/p} dx$. Let $r = q/p > 1$. Then $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-r} (\\log x)^{-2r} dx$. Since $r > 1$, converges.\nFor $q < p$: $r = q/p < 1$, diverges.\n\nSo this $f$ is in $L^p$ for all $p \\geq p_0$, not exactly one.\n\nI need to recall the correct construction. Actually, I think the problem might be asking to prove existence, not construct explicitly. We can use a measure-theoretic argument.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n \\chi_{I_n}(x)$ where $I_n$ are disjoint intervals and $a_n$ chosen so that $\\int |f|^p < \\infty$ iff $p = p_0$.\n\nLet $I_n = [n, n+1]$ and $a_n = n^{-1/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} = \\infty$ (harmonic series diverges).\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nLet $a_n = n^{-1/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2/p_0}$.\nThen $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$ (by integral test).\nFor $q > p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 > 1$, converges by p-test.\nFor $q < p_0$: $\\sum n^{-q/p_0} (\\log n)^{-2q/p_0}$. Since $q/p_0 < 1$, diverges.\n\nStill the same issue.\n\nActually, I think the correct statement is: There exists a function in $L^{p_0}$ but not in $L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$. The examples I'm thinking of are in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nLet me check a known fact: On $\\mathbb{R}^n$, if $f \\in L^p \\cap L^\\infty$, then $f \\in L^q$ for all $q \\geq p$.\nSo to have $f \\in L^p$ for exactly one $p$, $f$ cannot be bounded.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise (bounded domain).\nThen $\\int_0^1 x^{-q/p_0} dx$ converges iff $q/p_0 < 1$, i.e., $q < p_0$.\nSo $f \\in L^q$ for $q < p_0$, not for $q = p_0$ or $q > p_0$.\n\nCombine with an unbounded part: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0}$ for $0 < x < 1$, and $f(x) = x^{-2/p_0}$ for $x > 1$.\nThen for $q = p_0$: $\\int_0^1 x^{-1} dx + \\int_1^\\infty x^{-2} dx = \\infty + 1 = \\infty$, so not in $L^{p_0}$.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me search my memory: There's a known example: $f(x) = x^{-1/p} \\chi_{(0,1)}(x) + x^{-1/q} \\chi_{(1,\\infty)}(x)$ with $p < q$.\nThen $f \\in L^r$ iff $r < p$ (from behavior near 0) and $r > q$ (from behavior at infinity). Since $p < q$, there's no $r$ satisfying both.\n\nActually, I think the correct construction uses different exponents near 0 and infinity:\nLet $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ for $|x| < 1$, $f(x) = |x|^{-b}$ for $|x| > 1$, with $0 < a < b$.\nOn $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n- Near 0: $\\int_{|x|<1} |x|^{-ar} dx \\sim \\int_0^1 r^{n-1-ar} dr$ converges iff $ar < n$.\n- Near ∞: $\\int_{|x|>1} |x|^{-br} dx \\sim \\int_1^\\infty r^{n-1-br} dr$ converges iff $br > n$.\nSo $f \\in L^r$ iff $n/b < r < n/a$.\nIf we want exactly one $r$, we need $n/b = n/a$, i.e., $a = b$, but then $f(x) = |x|^{-a}$ everywhere, and the conditions become $r < n/a$ and $r > n/a$, impossible.\n\nSo on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there's no function in $L^p$ for exactly one $p$ if we use power functions.\n\nBut the problem asks to prove existence. Maybe we need a more clever construction.\n\nActually, I recall that for any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$, there exists $f$ such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^p$ for any $p \\neq p_0$.\nOne construction: Let $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n \\chi_{A_n}(x)$ where $A_n$ are disjoint sets with $|A_n| = a_n$, and $c_n$ chosen appropriately.\nWe want $\\int |f|^{p_0} = \\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n < \\infty$.\nBut for $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\infty$.\n\nChoose $c_n = n^{-1/p_0}$ and $a_n = n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$.\nThen $\\sum c_n^{p_0} a_n = \\sum n^{-1} \\cdot n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-2} (\\log n)^{-2} < \\infty$.\nFor $p > p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 > 1$, $n^{-p/p_0}$ decays fast, so converges.\nFor $p < p_0$: $\\sum c_n^p a_n = \\sum n^{-p/p_0} n^{-1} (\\log n)^{-2} = \\sum n^{-(1+p/p_0)} (\\log n)^{-2}$. Since $p/p_0 < 1$, $1+p/p_0 < 2$, could converge or diverge depending.\n\nNot working.\n\nI think the correct construction is: $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2/p_0} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nAs we saw, this is in $L^{p_0}$ and also in $L^q$ for all $q > p_0$.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for a function that is in $L^{p_0}$ but not in any other $L^p$ space. This is impossible if $p_0 > 1$ because of the inclusion $L^{p_0} \\subset L^1_{\\text{loc}}$ and interpolation.\n\nActually, I think there's a theorem: If $f \\in L^p \\cap L^q$ with $p < q$, then $f \\in L^r$ for all $p \\leq r \\leq q$.\nSo if $f \\in L^{p_0}$, then for any $q > p_0$, either $f \\in L^q$ or $f \\notin L^q$. But if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q > p_0$, that's possible. And if $f \\notin L^q$ for all $q < p_0$, that's also possible.\n\nSo we need $f \\in L^{p_0}$, $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$, and $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.\n\nConsider $f(x) = x^{-1/p_0} (\\log x)^{-1} \\chi_{(e,\\infty)}(x)$.\nFor $p = p_0$: $\\int_e^\\infty x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-p_0} dx$. Converges if $p_0 >\nWe prove the statement by explicit construction. Fix any $p_0 \\in [1, \\infty)$. We will construct a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ (an unbounded domain) such that $f \\in L^{p_0}$ but $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q \\neq p_0$ with $q \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Construction:** Define\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n|x|^{-1/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2/p_0}, & 0 < |x| < \\frac{1}{e}, \\\\\n|x|^{-1/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2/p_0}, & |x| > e, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe domain $\\mathbb{R}$ is clearly unbounded.\n\n**Step 1: Verify $f \\in L^{p_0}$.**\nWe compute $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |f(x)|^{p_0} \\, dx$ by splitting into two regions.\n\n*Near 0:* For $0 < |x| < 1/e$, we have\n\\[\n|f(x)|^{p_0} = |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2}.\n\\]\nUsing polar coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (or simply in one dimension, but the argument generalizes), the integral near 0 becomes\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|<1/e} |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx = C_n \\int_0^{1/e} r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{-2} \\, dr,\n\\]\nwhere $C_n$ is the surface area of the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Substitute $u = \\log(1/r)$, so $r = e^{-u}$, $dr = -e^{-u} du$, and when $r$ goes from $0$ to $1/e$, $u$ goes from $\\infty$ to $1$. Then\n\\[\n\\int_0^{1/e} r^{n-2} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^{-2} \\, dr = \\int_{\\infty}^{1} e^{-(n-2)u} u^{-2} (-e^{-u}) du = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{-(n-1)u} u^{-2} \\, du.\n\\]\nSince $e^{-(n-1)u}$ decays exponentially and $u^{-2}$ is integrable at infinity, this integral converges.\n\n*Near infinity:* For $|x| > e$, we have\n\\[\n|f(x)|^{p_0} = |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2}.\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|>e} |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2} \\, dx = C_n \\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr = C_n \\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-2} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr.\n\\]\nSubstitute $u = \\log r$, so $r = e^u$, $dr = e^u du$, and\n\\[\n\\int_e^{\\infty} r^{n-2} (\\log r)^{-2} \\, dr = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{(n-2)u} u^{-2} e^u du = \\int_1^{\\infty} e^{(n-1)u} u^{-2} \\, du.\n\\]\nThis integral diverges because $e^{(n-1)u}$ grows exponentially. Wait, there is a mistake: For convergence at infinity, we need the integrand to decay sufficiently fast. Actually, $|x|^{-1}$ gives $r^{-1}$ in radial integration, and $r^{n-1} \\cdot r^{-1} = r^{n-2}$. For large $r$, $r^{n-2}$ grows if $n > 2$, so the integral diverges. This suggests our construction needs adjustment for dimensions $n \\geq 2$.\n\nLet us instead work in one dimension ($\\mathbb{R}$) to avoid dimensional complications. In one dimension:\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|>e} |x|^{-1} (\\log|x|)^{-2} \\, dx = 2 \\int_e^{\\infty} x^{-1} (\\log x)^{-2} \\, dx.\n\\]\nSubstitute $u = \\log x$, $du = dx/x$, giving\n\\[\n2 \\int_1^{\\infty} u^{-2} \\, du = 2 \\left[ -u^{-1} \\right]_1^{\\infty} = 2.\n\\]\nThus the integral converges. Similarly, near 0:\n\\[\n\\int_{|x|<1/e} |x|^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx = 2 \\int_0^{1/e} x^{-1} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{-2} \\, dx.\n\\]\nWith $u = \\log(1/x)$, $du = -dx/x$, we get\n\\[\n2 \\int_{\\infty}^{1} u^{-2} (-du) = 2 \\int_1^{\\infty} u^{-2} \\, du = 2.\n\\]\nHence $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |f|^{p_0} = 4 < \\infty$, so $f \\in L^{p_0}$.\n\n**Step 2: Show $f \\notin L^q$ for $q > p_0$.**\nTake $q > p_0$ and consider $\\int |f|^q$. Near 0, for $0 < |x| < 1/e$,\n\\[\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2q/p_0}.\n\\]\nSince $q/p_0 > 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ has a singularity at 0 that is not integrable in any neighborhood of 0. More precisely, for small $x$,\n\\[\n|x|^{-q/p_0} \\left(\\log\\frac{1}{|x|}\\right)^{-2q/p_0} \\sim |x|^{-q/p_0} \\cdot (\\text{slowly varying factor}),\n\\]\nand $\\int_0^{\\delta} x^{-\\alpha} \\, dx$ diverges for $\\alpha \\geq 1$. Here $\\alpha = q/p_0 > 1$, so the integral diverges. Therefore $\\int_{|x|<1/e} |f|^q = \\infty$, and consequently $f \\notin L^q$.\n\n**Step 3: Show $f \\notin L^q$ for $q < p_0$.**\nTake $q < p_0$. Now examine the behavior at infinity. For $|x| > e$,\n\\[\n|f(x)|^q = |x|^{-q/p_0} (\\log|x|)^{-2q/p_0}.\n\\]\nSince $q/p_0 < 1$, the factor $|x|^{-q/p_0}$ decays too slowly. Indeed,\n\\[\n\\int_e^{\\infty} x^{-q/p_0} (\\log x)^{-2q/p_0} \\, dx\n\\]\ndiverges because $x^{-q/p_0}$ with exponent less than 1 is not integrable at infinity (compare with $\\int^\\infty x^{-\\beta} dx$, which converges only for $\\beta > 1$). The logarithmic factor does not alter this divergence. Hence $\\int_{|x|>e} |f|^q = \\infty$, and $f \\notin L^q$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nWe have constructed a function $f$ defined on the unbounded domain $\\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n- $f \\in L^{p_0}$ (Step 1),\n- $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q > p_0$ (Step 2),\n- $f \\notin L^q$ for any $q < p_0$ (Step 3).\nThus $f$ belongs to $L^p$ for exactly one $p$, namely $p = p_0$. Since $p_0$ was arbitrary in $[1, \\infty)$, the statement is proved.\n\n**Remark:** The construction works in one dimension. For higher dimensions $\\mathbb{R}^n$, one can adjust the exponents appropriately (using $|x|^{-n/p_0}$ instead of $|x|^{-1/p_0}$ to account for the radial integration factor $r^{n-1}$) and follow a similar argument.",
