Since AB = I_n, B must be an n×p matrix for some p. But AB = A_{n×n}B_{n×p} = I_{n×n}, which implies p = n, so B is n×n (square).\n\nNow we need to show BA = I. Since A and B are both n×n matrices with AB = I, we can use several approaches:\n\n1. **Using determinants:** det(AB) = det(A)det(B) = det(I) = 1, so det(A) ≠ 0 and det(B) ≠ 0. Thus A and B are invertible. Since AB = I, we have B = A⁻¹, so BA = A⁻¹A = I.\n\n2. **Using rank-nullity:** Since AB = I, A is surjective (onto) and B is injective (one-to-one) as linear transformations on ℝⁿ. For finite-dimensional spaces, surjective implies injective and vice versa, so both are bijective. Thus A and B are invertible, and B = A⁻¹, so BA = I.\n\n3. **Direct approach:** Since AB = I, we have A(BA) = (AB)A = IA = A. Thus A(BA - I) = 0. Since A is invertible (as AB = I implies A has full rank), we can multiply on the left by A⁻¹ to get BA - I = 0, so BA = I.\n\nTherefore, BA = I.\n\nNow I'll format this according to the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"yes\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"A is a square matrix\", \"AB = I, where I is the identity matrix\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"B is a square matrix\",\n  \"new_problem\": \"New problem:\\nAssumptions:\\nAssumption 1: A is a square matrix\\nAssumption 2: AB = I, where I is the identity matrix\\nProblem:\\nShow that BA = I\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"Given A is an n×n matrix and AB = I_n.
