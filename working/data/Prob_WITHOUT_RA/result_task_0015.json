    "Content":"I am trying to prove the convergence of the $p$ -series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac1{n^p}.$$ for $p > 1$ . I am wondering if there is a proof that this series converges, either directly or by applying some test for convergence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"We can bound the partial sums by multiples of themselves: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{2k+1}\n&=&\n\\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p}\\\\\n&=&\n1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)\\\\\n&<&1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p}\\\\\n&=&1+2^{1-p}S_k\\\\\n&<&1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ Then solving for $S_{2k+1}$ yields $$S_{2k+1}<\\frac{1}{1-2^{1-p}}\\;,$$ and since the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it converges. Eight years after I posted this, Zach Teitler pointed out that this proof was already published in $1979$ by Teresa Cohen and William J. Knight in Convergence and Divergence of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1\/n^p$ , Mathematics Magazine, $52(3)$ , $1979$ , p. $178$ ( accessible version , DOI link ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the convergence of the p-series ∑1\/n^p for p > 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, and p is greater than 1. So the assumptions should list each condition separately. The user's example had each assumption on a new line, addressing one property per object.\n\nLooking at the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the series is from n=1 to infinity, but the key condition is that p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence under these conditions. \n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any other conditions except p > 1. The series is ∑1\/n^p, so the variable is n, and p is a parameter. So the main assumption is p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence for this series when p is greater than 1. \n\nI think the assumptions here are straightforward: p is a real number, p > 1. Each of these should be separate. But maybe the user wants each condition per line. So \"p is a real number\" and \"p > 1\" as two separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that the series converges under these conditions.\n\nI should check if there are other implicit assumptions. The series is from n=1 to infinity, which is standard for p-series, so maybe that's part of the problem statement but not an assumption. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem here, n is the summation index, so it's already an integer starting at 1. But the original problem didn't state that as an assumption, so maybe it's not necessary here. The key assumption is p > 1. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions: p is a real number, p > 1. Then the problem is to prove convergence of the series. \n\nWait, but in the example, they had the assumption that n is an integer even though in the original problem it's implied. So maybe here, even though p is a parameter, we need to list that p is a real number. So the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number\n- p > 1\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the series ∑1\/n^p from n=1 to infinity converges. \n\nThat should be correct. Let me confirm with the example. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for p > 1, so the key conditions are p being real and greater than 1. So yes, that's the way to go.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"Assumption:\nAssumption 1: $p > 1$\nProblem:\nProve that $p$ is a real number\nWe are given that p > 1. To prove that p is a real number, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Definition of the inequality relation**: The symbol '>' denotes the 'greater than' relation. In standard mathematics, this relation is defined on the set of real numbers ℝ. Formally, '>' is a binary relation on ℝ, meaning it takes two real numbers as inputs and returns a truth value (true or false).\n\n2. **Meaning of the statement p > 1**: The statement p > 1 asserts that the ordered pair (p, 1) satisfies the 'greater than' relation. That is, p stands in the relation 'greater than' to the number 1.\n\n3. **Properties of the number 1**: The number 1 is a real number. This is a fundamental fact: 1 ∈ ℝ.\n\n4. **Domain requirement of the relation**: Since '>' is defined as a relation on ℝ × ℝ, for the expression p > 1 to be meaningful (i.e., to have a well-defined truth value), both p and 1 must be elements of ℝ. The relation '>' cannot be applied to objects outside its domain.\n\n5. **Logical deduction**: \n   - Premise: p > 1 is given.\n   - The expression p > 1 involves the binary relation '>' applied to p and 1.\n   - The relation '>' is defined only for real numbers.\n   - Therefore, for p > 1 to be a valid mathematical statement, p must be a real number.\n   - More formally: If p were not a real number, then p > 1 would be undefined or meaningless, contradicting the given premise that p > 1 is true.\n\n6. **Alternative perspective**: In the context of ordered fields, the real numbers ℝ form the standard example of a complete ordered field. The inequality symbol '>' is part of the order structure of ℝ. Any element that can be compared to 1 using '>' must belong to the same ordered field, which in this context is ℝ.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: From the given p > 1 and the definition of the inequality relation, we conclude that p must be a real number. That is, p ∈ ℝ.\n\nThis proof relies on the fundamental definition of the inequality relation in real analysis. The key insight is that mathematical relations have specific domains, and applying a relation outside its domain results in an undefined expression. Since p > 1 is given as a true statement, p must belong to the domain of '>', which is ℝ.",
