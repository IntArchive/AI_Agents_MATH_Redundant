We will prove that A is similar to a matrix in Jordan canonical form.\\n\\n**Step 1: Factorization of the Characteristic Polynomial**\\nLet p(λ) = det(λI - A) be the characteristic polynomial of A. Since F is algebraically closed, every polynomial with coefficients in F factors completely into linear factors. Therefore, we can write:\\n\\np(λ) = (λ - λ₁)^{m₁}(λ - λ₂)^{m₂}⋯(λ - λ_k)^{m_k}\\n\\nwhere λ₁, λ₂, ..., λ_k are the distinct eigenvalues of A (possibly with repetitions), and m₁, m₂, ..., m_k are their algebraic multiplicities with m₁ + m₂ + ⋯ + m_k = n.\\n\\n**Step 2: Cayley-Hamilton Theorem**\\nThe Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic polynomial. That is, p(A) = 0, where p(A) is obtained by substituting the matrix A for the variable λ in p(λ). Therefore:\\n\\np(A) = (A - λ₁I)^{m₁}(A - λ₂I)^{m₂}⋯(A - λ_kI)^{m_k} = 0\\n\\n**Step 3: Primary Decomposition Theorem**\\nFor each eigenvalue λ_i, define the generalized eigenspace:\\n\\nV_i = {v ∈ F^n : (A - λ_iI)^{m_i}v = 0}\\n\\nNote that V_i is the null space of (A - λ_iI)^{m_i}. The primary decomposition theorem states that:\\n\\nF^n = V₁ ⊕ V₂ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ V_k\\n\\nwhere ⊕ denotes direct sum. This means every vector v ∈ F^n can be uniquely written as v = v₁ + v₂ + ⋯ + v_k with v_i ∈ V_i. Moreover, each V_i is invariant under A (i.e., A(V_i) ⊆ V_i).\\n\\n**Step 4: Construction of Jordan Chains**\\nFor each generalized eigenspace V_i corresponding to eigenvalue λ_i, we construct a basis consisting of Jordan chains. A Jordan chain of length ℓ for eigenvalue λ_i is a sequence of vectors v₁, v₂, ..., v_ℓ such that:\\n\\n(A - λ_iI)v₁ = 0\\n(A - λ_iI)v₂ = v₁\\n(A - λ_iI)v₃ = v₂\\n⋮\\n(A - λ_iI)v_ℓ = v_{ℓ-1}\\n\\nand (A - λ_iI)^{ℓ}v_ℓ = 0 but (A - λ_iI)^{ℓ-1}v_ℓ ≠ 0.\\n\\nTo construct such chains, we proceed as follows:\\n1.

For each such vector v ∈ W_j \\\\ W_{j-1}, we can construct a Jordan chain of length j by setting:\\n   v_j = v\\n   v_{j-1} = (A - λ_iI)v_j\\n   v_{j-2} = (A - λ_iI)v_{j-1}\\n   ⋮\\n   v_1 = (A - λ_iI)v_2\\n\\nThese chains are linearly independent and their union forms a basis for V_i.\\n\\n**Step 5: Jordan Canonical Form**\\nLet B be the basis of F^n obtained by taking the union of all Jordan chains from all generalized eigenspaces. With respect to this basis B, the matrix representation of A has the following structure:\\n\\nFor each Jordan chain v₁, v₂, ..., v_ℓ corresponding to eigenvalue λ_i, we have:\\n\\nA v₁ = λ_i v₁\\nA v₂ = v₁ + λ_i v₂\\nA v₃ = v₂ + λ_i v₃\\n⋮\\nA v_ℓ = v_{ℓ-1} + λ_i v_ℓ\\n\\nTherefore, the restriction of A to the subspace spanned by this chain is represented by a Jordan block:\\n\\nJ(λ_i, ℓ) = \\n⎡ λ_i  1     0   ⋯  0 ⎤\\n⎢ 0    λ_i  1   ⋯  0 ⎥\\n⎢ ⋮    ⋮    ⋮   ⋱  ⋮ ⎥\\n⎢ 0    0    0   ⋯  λ_i ⎦\\n\\nwhere the matrix is ℓ × ℓ with λ_i on the diagonal, 1's on the superdiagonal, and 0's elsewhere.\\n\\nSince the basis B consists of Jordan chains from all generalized eigenspaces, the matrix representation of A with respect to B is a block diagonal matrix:\\n\\nJ = diag(J(λ₁, ℓ₁₁), J(λ₁, ℓ₁₂), ..., J(λ_k, ℓ_{k1}), J(λ_k, ℓ_{k2}), ...)\\n\\nwhere each J(λ_i, ℓ_{ij}) is a Jordan block for eigenvalue λ_i of size ℓ_{ij}.\\n\\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\\nWe have shown that there exists a basis B of F^n such that the matrix representation of A with respect to B is in Jordan canonical form J. This means A is similar to J, since if P is the change-of-basis matrix from the standard basis to B, then J = P^{-1}AP.\\n\\nTherefore, every square matrix over an algebraically closed field is similar to a Jordan canonical form. ∎\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

Moreover, each V_i is invariant under A (i.e., A(V_i) ⊆ V_i).\n\n**Step 4: Construction of Jordan Chains**\nFor each generalized eigenspace V_i corresponding to eigenvalue λ_i, we construct a basis consisting of Jordan chains. A Jordan chain of length ℓ for eigenvalue λ_i is a sequence of vectors v₁, v₂, ..., v_ℓ such that:\n\n(A - λ_iI)v₁ = 0\n(A - λ_iI)v₂ = v₁\n(A - λ_iI)v₃ = v₂\n⋮\n(A - λ_iI)v_ℓ = v_{ℓ-1}\n\nand (A - λ_iI)^{ℓ}v_ℓ = 0 but (A - λ_iI)^{ℓ-1}v_ℓ ≠ 0.\n\nTo construct such chains, we proceed as follows:\n1. Let W_0 = {0} and for j ≥ 1, define W_j = ker((A - λ_iI)^j).\n2. Note that W_0 ⊆ W_1 ⊆ W_2 ⊆ ⋯ ⊆ W_{m_i} = V_i.\n3. For each j, choose vectors that extend a basis of W_{j-1} to a basis of W_j.\n4. For each such vector v ∈ W_j \\ W_{j-1}, we can construct a Jordan chain of length j by setting:\n   v_j = v\n   v_{j-1} = (A - λ_iI)v_j\n   v_{j-2} = (A - λ_iI)v_{j-1}\n   ⋮\n   v_1 = (A - λ_iI)v_2\n\nThese chains are linearly independent and their union forms a basis for V_i.\n\n**Step 5: Jordan Canonical Form**\nLet B be the basis of F^n obtained by taking the union of all Jordan chains from all generalized eigenspaces. With respect to this basis B, the matrix representation of A has the following structure:\n\nFor each Jordan chain v₁, v₂, ..., v_ℓ corresponding to eigenvalue λ_i, we have:\n\nA v₁ = λ_i v₁\nA v₂ = v₁ + λ_i v₂\nA v₃ = v₂ + λ_i v₃\n⋮\nA v_ℓ = v_{ℓ-1} + λ_i v_ℓ\n\nTherefore, the restriction of A to the subspace spanned by this chain is represented by a Jordan block:\n\nJ(λ_i, ℓ) = \n⎡ λ_i  1     0   ⋯  0 ⎤\n⎢ 0    λ_i  1   ⋯  0 ⎥\n⎢ ⋮    ⋮    ⋮   ⋱  ⋮ ⎥\n⎢ 0    0    0   ⋯  λ_i ⎦\n\nwhere the matrix is ℓ × ℓ with λ_i on the diagonal, 1's on the superdiagonal, and 0's elsewhere.\n\nSince the basis B consists of Jordan chains from all generalized eigenspaces, the matrix representation of A with respect to B is a block diagonal matrix:\n\nJ = diag(J(λ₁, ℓ₁₁), J(λ₁, ℓ₁₂), ..., J(λ_k, ℓ_{k1}), J(λ_k, ℓ_{k2}), ...)\n\nwhere each J(λ_i, ℓ_{ij}) is a Jordan block for eigenvalue λ_i of size ℓ_{ij}.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nWe have shown that there exists a basis B of F^n such that the matrix representation of A with respect to B is in Jordan canonical form J. This means A is similar to J, since if P is the change-of-basis matrix from the standard basis to B, then J = P^{-1}AP.\n\nTherefore, every square matrix over an algebraically closed field is similar to a Jordan canonical form. ∎",
