We need to show that for n ≥ 4, no power of 2 has all even digits.\\n\\n**Case 2: n ≥ 4**\\nAssume, for contradiction, that there exists some n ≥ 4 such that 2^n has all even digits. Let N = 2^n.\\n\\n**Step 1: Divisibility by 4**\\nSince n ≥ 2, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 4). That is, N is divisible by 4.\\n\\n**Step 2: Properties of numbers with all even digits**\\nIf a number has all even digits in base ten, then:\\n1. It is even (obviously).\\n2. When considered modulo 4, the remainder is determined by the last two digits.\\n\\nLet's analyze the possible last two digits of a number with all even digits. The possible pairs (tens digit, units digit) where both digits are even are:\\n00, 02, 04, 06, 08, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88.\\n\\nComputing these modulo 4:\\n- Numbers ending in 00, 04, 08, 20, 24, 28, 40, 44, 48, 60, 64, 68, 80, 84, 88 ≡ 0 (mod 4)\\n- Numbers ending in 02, 06, 22, 26, 42, 46, 62, 66, 82, 86 ≡ 2 (mod 4)\\n\\nThus, a number with all even digits is either ≡ 0 (mod 4) or ≡ 2 (mod 4).\\n\\nSince N = 2^n with n ≥ 2 is divisible by 4, we must have N ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, if N has all even digits, its last two digits must be one of those giving remainder 0 mod 4.\\n\\n**Step 3: Divisibility by 8**\\nFor n ≥ 3, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 8). So N is divisible by 8.\\n\\nA number divisible by 8 must have its last three digits forming a number divisible by 8. We need to check which three-digit numbers with all even digits are divisible by 8.\\n\\nLet's consider the possible last three digits (hundreds, tens, units) where all digits are even. We need to find which of these are divisible by 8.\\n\\nRather than listing all 5^3 = 125 possibilities (since each digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), we can use a more efficient approach.\\n\\n**Step 4: Modular arithmetic with higher powers of 2**\\nFor n ≥ 4, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 16).\\nConsider N modulo 16. If N has all even digits, we can write N in base 10 as:\\nN = d_k·10^k + d_{k-1}·10^{k-1} + ... + d_1·10 + d_0, where each d_i ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\\n\\nNow consider N modulo 16. Note that 10 ≡ 10 (mod 16), 10^2 = 100 ≡ 4 (mod 16), 10^3 = 1000 ≡ 8 (mod 16), 10^4 = 10000 ≡ 0 (mod 16).\\n\\nThus, for k ≥ 4, all terms with 10^i for i ≥ 4 are divisible by 16. Therefore:\\nN ≡ d_3·10^3 + d_2·10^2 + d_1·10 + d_0 (mod 16)\\n  ≡ 8d_3 + 4d_2 + 10d_1 + d_0 (mod 16)\\n\\nSince each d_i is even, let d_i = 2e_i where e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Then:\\nN ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 16)\\n  ≡ 8e_2 + 4e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 16)  (since 16e_3 ≡ 0, 20e_1 ≡ 4e_1 mod 16)\\n\\nThus, N ≡ 2(4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0) (mod 16).\\n\\nBut we know that for n ≥ 4, N = 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 16). Therefore:\\n2(4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0) ≡ 0 (mod 16)\\n⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8)\\n\\n**Step 5: Analyzing the congruence**\\nWe have 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8), where e_0, e_1, e_2 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\\n\\nLet's check all possibilities. Since e_0, e_1, e_2 are small, we can systematically check or reason:\\n- The maximum value of 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 is 4·4 + 2·4 + 4 = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28.\\n- We need this sum to be divisible by 8.\\n\\nConsider the expression modulo 2: 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ e_0 (mod 2). For the sum to be even (divisible by 2, which is necessary for divisibility by 8), we need e_0 to be even. So e_0 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow let e_0 = 0, 2, or 4. We need to check if there exist e_1, e_2 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} such that 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 is a multiple of 8.\\n\\n**Case analysis:**\\n1. If e_0 = 0: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 8). Since 4e_2 is divisible by 4, and 2e_1 is even, their sum is even. For it to be divisible by 8, it must be divisible by 8. The possible values of 4e_2 are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. The possible values of 2e_1 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. We need their sum to be 0, 8, 16, or 24 mod 8 (i.e., 0 mod 8). Checking combinations shows there are solutions (e.g., e_2=2, e_1=0 gives 8; e_2=0, e_1=4 gives 8; etc.).\\n\\n2. If e_0 = 2: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 6 (mod 8). But 4e_2 is divisible by 4, so 4e_2 mod 8 is either 0 or 4. Then 2e_1 mod 8 can be 0, 2, 4, 6. We need (4e_2 + 2e_1) mod 8 = 6. Checking: if 4e_2 ≡ 0 mod 8, then 2e_1 ≡ 6 mod 8 ⇒ e_1 = 3 (since 2·3=6). If 4e_2 ≡ 4 mod 8, then 2e_1 ≡ 2 mod 8 ⇒ e_1 = 1. So there are solutions.\\n\\n3. If e_0 = 4: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 4 (mod 8). Similar analysis shows solutions exist.\\n\\nThus, the congruence 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8) has solutions. This means the condition N ≡ 0 (mod 16) does not immediately give a contradiction.\\n\\n**Step 6: Stronger condition using modulo 32**\\nFor n ≥ 5, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 32). Let's consider N modulo 32.\\n\\nWe have 10 ≡ 10 (mod 32), 10^2 = 100 ≡ 4 (mod 32), 10^3 = 1000 ≡ 8 (mod 32), 10^4 = 10000 ≡ 16 (mod 32), 10^5 = 100000 ≡ 0 (mod 32).\\n\\nThus, for k ≥ 5:\\nN ≡ d_4·10^4 + d_3·10^3 + d_2·10^2 + d_1·10 + d_0 (mod 32)\\n  ≡ 16d_4 + 8d_3 + 4d_2 + 10d_1 + d_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nWrite d_i = 2e_i with e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}:\\nN ≡ 32e_4 + 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n  ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nSince 20 ≡ -12 (mod 32), we have:\\nN ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 - 12e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nBut N ≡ 0 (mod 32) for n ≥ 5, so:\\n16e_3 + 8e_2 - 12e_1 + 2e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 32)\\n\\nDivide by 2 (since all terms are even):\\n8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 16)\\n\\n**Step 7: Analyzing this stronger congruence**\\nWe need 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 16), with e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\\n\\nConsider this modulo 2: 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ e_0 (mod 2). For the left side to be even (necessary for divisibility by 16), we need e_0 even: e_0 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow consider modulo 4: 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ -2e_1 + e_0 (mod 4) since 8e_3 ≡ 0, 4e_2 ≡ 0 mod 4.\\nSo we need -2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\n\\nSince e_0 is even, let's check cases:\\n- If e_0 = 0: Need -2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ 2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is even: e_1 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n- If e_0 = 2: Need -2e_1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ -2e_1 ≡ -2 (mod 4) ⇒ 2e_1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is odd: e_1 ∈ {1, 3}.\\n- If e_0 = 4: Need -2e_1 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ -2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is even: e_1 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow we need to check if there exist e_1, e_2, e_3 satisfying the full congruence modulo 16. Let's test some possibilities.\\n\\nTake e_0 = 0, e_1 = 0 (even). Then we need 8e_3 + 4e_2 ≡ 0 (mod 16). The possible values of 8e_3 are 0, 8, 16, 24, 32. The possible values of 4e_2 are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Their sum modulo 16 must be 0. There are solutions (e.g., e_3=0, e_2=0 gives 0; e_3=2, e_2=0 gives 16≡0).\\n\\nSo again, solutions exist. We need an even stronger condition.\\n\\n**Step 8: Key insight - consider modulo 5 or modulo 10^k**\\nA more efficient approach is to note that if a number has all even digits, then it is divisible by 2 but not necessarily by higher powers of 2 in a restrictive way. However, powers of 2 have very specific patterns modulo powers of 10.\\n\\nConsider the last k digits of 2^n for sufficiently large n. It is known that the last k digits of powers of 2 eventually become periodic. For example, the last digit cycles with period 4: 2, 4, 8, 6. The last two digits cycle with period 20 starting from n=2. The last three digits cycle with period 100 starting from n=3, etc.\\n\\nWe can check that among the numbers in these cycles, none have all even digits (except for the very small ones we already found: 2, 4, 8).\\n\\nLet's check the last two digits for n ≥ 2: The cycle is: 04, 08, 16, 32, 64, 28, 56, 12, 24, 48, 96, 92, 84, 68, 36, 72, 44, 88, 76, 52, 04, ...\\nNone of these have both digits even (except 04, 08, 24, 28, 44, 48, 64, 68, 84, 88). Wait, many of these DO have both digits even! For example: 04, 08, 24, 28, 44, 48, 64, 68, 84, 88 all have both digits even.\\n\\nSo the last two digits alone don't rule out the possibility.\\n\\n**Step 9: Check last three digits**\\nWe need to check if any power of 2 has its last three digits all even. Let's examine the cycle of last three digits for powers of 2 (starting from n=3). The cycle length is 100 for the last three digits.\\n\\nWe can reason: If 2^n has all even digits, then in particular its last three digits are all even and form a number divisible by 8 (since for n ≥ 3, 2^n is divisible by 8).\\n\\nWe need to check if there exists a three-digit number with all even digits that is:\\n1. Divisible by 8\\n2. Actually occurs as the last three digits of some power of 2.\\n\\nLet's list all three-digit numbers with all even digits that are divisible by 8:\\nThe even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. We need numbers of the form ABC where A, B, C ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} and 100A+10B+C is divisible by 8.\\n\\nSince 100A ≡ 4A (mod 8) because 100 ≡ 4 mod 8, and 10B ≡ 2B mod 8, we need 4A + 2B + C ≡ 0 mod 8.\\n\\nWe can search systematically. Let's list some: 000, 008, 024, 040, 048, 064"

We need to show that for n ≥ 4, no power of 2 has all even digits.\\n\\n**Case 2: n ≥ 4**\\nAssume, for contradiction, that there exists some n ≥ 4 such that 2^n has all even digits. Let N = 2^n.\\n\\n**Step 1: Divisibility by 4**\\nSince n ≥ 2, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 4). That is, N is divisible by 4.\\n\\n**Step 2: Properties of numbers with all even digits**\\nIf a number has all even digits in base ten, then:\\n1. It is even (obviously).\\n2. When considered modulo 4, the remainder is determined by the last two digits.\\n\\nLet's analyze the possible last two digits of a number with all even digits. The possible pairs (tens digit, units digit) where both digits are even are:\\n00, 02, 04, 06, 08, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88.\\n\\nComputing these modulo 4:\\n- Numbers ending in 00, 04, 08, 20, 24, 28, 40, 44, 48, 60, 64, 68, 80, 84, 88 ≡ 0 (mod 4)\\n- Numbers ending in 02, 06, 22, 26, 42, 46, 62, 66, 82, 86 ≡ 2 (mod 4)\\n\\nThus, a number with all even digits is either ≡ 0 (mod 4) or ≡ 2 (mod 4).\\n\\nSince N = 2^n with n ≥ 2 is divisible by 4, we must have N ≡ 0 (mod 4). Therefore, if N has all even digits, its last two digits must be one of those giving remainder 0 mod 4.\\n\\n**Step 3: Divisibility by 8**\\nFor n ≥ 3, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 8). So N is divisible by 8.\\n\\nA number divisible by 8 must have its last three digits forming a number divisible by 8. We need to check which three-digit numbers with all even digits are divisible by 8.\\n\\nLet's consider the possible last three digits (hundreds, tens, units) where all digits are even. We need to find which of these are divisible by 8.\\n\\nRather than listing all 5^3 = 125 possibilities (since each digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), we can use a more efficient approach.\\n\\n**Step 4: Modular arithmetic with higher powers of 2**\\nFor n ≥ 4, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 16).\\nConsider N modulo 16. If N has all even digits, we can write N in base 10 as:\\nN = d_k·10^k + d_{k-1}·10^{k-1} + ... + d_1·10 + d_0, where each d_i ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}.\\n\\nNow consider N modulo 16. Note that 10 ≡ 10 (mod 16), 10^2 = 100 ≡ 4 (mod 16), 10^3 = 1000 ≡ 8 (mod 16), 10^4 = 10000 ≡ 0 (mod 16).\\n\\nThus, for k ≥ 4, all terms with 10^i for i ≥ 4 are divisible by 16. Therefore:\\nN ≡ d_3·10^3 + d_2·10^2 + d_1·10 + d_0 (mod 16)\\n  ≡ 8d_3 + 4d_2 + 10d_1 + d_0 (mod 16)\\n\\nSince each d_i is even, let d_i = 2e_i where e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Then:\\nN ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 16)\\n  ≡ 8e_2 + 4e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 16)  (since 16e_3 ≡ 0, 20e_1 ≡ 4e_1 mod 16)\\n\\nThus, N ≡ 2(4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0) (mod 16).\\n\\nBut we know that for n ≥ 4, N = 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 16). Therefore:\\n2(4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0) ≡ 0 (mod 16)\\n⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8)\\n\\n**Step 5: Analyzing the congruence**\\nWe have 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8), where e_0, e_1, e_2 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\\n\\nLet's check all possibilities. Since e_0, e_1, e_2 are small, we can systematically check or reason:\\n- The maximum value of 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 is 4·4 + 2·4 + 4 = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28.\\n- We need this sum to be divisible by 8.\\n\\nConsider the expression modulo 2: 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ e_0 (mod 2). For the sum to be even (divisible by 2, which is necessary for divisibility by 8), we need e_0 to be even. So e_0 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow let e_0 = 0, 2, or 4. We need to check if there exist e_1, e_2 ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} such that 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 is a multiple of 8.\\n\\n**Case analysis:**\\n1. If e_0 = 0: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 8). Since 4e_2 is divisible by 4, and 2e_1 is even, their sum is even. For it to be divisible by 8, it must be divisible by 8. The possible values of 4e_2 are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. The possible values of 2e_1 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. We need their sum to be 0, 8, 16, or 24 mod 8 (i.e., 0 mod 8). Checking combinations shows there are solutions (e.g., e_2=2, e_1=0 gives 8; e_2=0, e_1=4 gives 8; etc.).\\n\\n2. If e_0 = 2: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 6 (mod 8). But 4e_2 is divisible by 4, so 4e_2 mod 8 is either 0 or 4. Then 2e_1 mod 8 can be 0, 2, 4, 6. We need (4e_2 + 2e_1) mod 8 = 6. Checking: if 4e_2 ≡ 0 mod 8, then 2e_1 ≡ 6 mod 8 ⇒ e_1 = 3 (since 2·3=6). If 4e_2 ≡ 4 mod 8, then 2e_1 ≡ 2 mod 8 ⇒ e_1 = 1. So there are solutions.\\n\\n3. If e_0 = 4: We need 4e_2 + 2e_1 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ 4e_2 + 2e_1 ≡ 4 (mod 8). Similar analysis shows solutions exist.\\n\\nThus, the congruence 4e_2 + 2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 8) has solutions. This means the condition N ≡ 0 (mod 16) does not immediately give a contradiction.\\n\\n**Step 6: Stronger condition using modulo 32**\\nFor n ≥ 5, we have 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 32). Let's consider N modulo 32.\\n\\nWe have 10 ≡ 10 (mod 32), 10^2 = 100 ≡ 4 (mod 32), 10^3 = 1000 ≡ 8 (mod 32), 10^4 = 10000 ≡ 16 (mod 32), 10^5 = 100000 ≡ 0 (mod 32).\\n\\nThus, for k ≥ 5:\\nN ≡ d_4·10^4 + d_3·10^3 + d_2·10^2 + d_1·10 + d_0 (mod 32)\\n  ≡ 16d_4 + 8d_3 + 4d_2 + 10d_1 + d_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nWrite d_i = 2e_i with e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}:\\nN ≡ 32e_4 + 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n  ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 + 20e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nSince 20 ≡ -12 (mod 32), we have:\\nN ≡ 16e_3 + 8e_2 - 12e_1 + 2e_0 (mod 32)\\n\\nBut N ≡ 0 (mod 32) for n ≥ 5, so:\\n16e_3 + 8e_2 - 12e_1 + 2e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 32)\\n\\nDivide by 2 (since all terms are even):\\n8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 16)\\n\\n**Step 7: Analyzing this stronger congruence**\\nWe need 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 16), with e_i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\\n\\nConsider this modulo 2: 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ e_0 (mod 2). For the left side to be even (necessary for divisibility by 16), we need e_0 even: e_0 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow consider modulo 4: 8e_3 + 4e_2 - 6e_1 + e_0 ≡ -2e_1 + e_0 (mod 4) since 8e_3 ≡ 0, 4e_2 ≡ 0 mod 4.\\nSo we need -2e_1 + e_0 ≡ 0 (mod 4).\\n\\nSince e_0 is even, let's check cases:\\n- If e_0 = 0: Need -2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ 2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is even: e_1 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n- If e_0 = 2: Need -2e_1 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ -2e_1 ≡ -2 (mod 4) ⇒ 2e_1 ≡ 2 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is odd: e_1 ∈ {1, 3}.\\n- If e_0 = 4: Need -2e_1 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ -2e_1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) ⇒ e_1 is even: e_1 ∈ {0, 2, 4}.\\n\\nNow we need to check if there exist e_1, e_2, e_3 satisfying the full congruence modulo 16. Let's test some possibilities.\\n\\nTake e_0 = 0, e_1 = 0 (even). Then we need 8e_3 + 4e_2 ≡ 0 (mod 16). The possible values of 8e_3 are 0, 8, 16, 24, 32. The possible values of 4e_2 are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Their sum modulo 16 must be 0. There are solutions (e.g., e_3=0, e_2=0 gives 0; e_3=2, e_2=0 gives 16≡0).\\n\\nSo again, solutions exist. We need an even stronger condition.\\n\\n**Step 8: Key insight - consider modulo 5 or modulo 10^k**\\nA more efficient approach is to note that if a number has all even digits, then it is divisible by 2 but not necessarily by higher powers of 2 in a restrictive way. However, powers of 2 have very specific patterns modulo powers of 10.\\n\\nConsider the last k digits of 2^n for sufficiently large n. It is known that the last k digits of powers of 2 eventually become periodic. For example, the last digit cycles with period 4: 2, 4, 8, 6. The last two digits cycle with period 20 starting from n=2. The last three digits cycle with period 100 starting from n=3, etc.\\n\\nWe can check that among the numbers in these cycles, none have all even digits (except for the very small ones we already found: 2, 4, 8).\\n\\nLet's check the last two digits for n ≥ 2: The cycle is: 04, 08, 16, 32, 64, 28, 56, 12, 24, 48, 96, 92, 84, 68, 36, 72, 44, 88, 76, 52, 04, ...\\nNone of these have both digits even (except 04, 08, 24, 28, 44, 48, 64, 68, 84, 88). Wait, many of these DO have both digits even! For example: 04, 08, 24, 28, 44, 48, 64, 68, 84, 88 all have both digits even.\\n\\nSo the last two digits alone don't rule out the possibility.\\n\\n**Step 9: Check last three digits**\\nWe need to check if any power of 2 has its last three digits all even. Let's examine the cycle of last three digits for powers of 2 (starting from n=3). The cycle length is 100 for the last three digits.\\n\\nWe can reason: If 2^n has all even digits, then in particular its last three digits are all even and form a number divisible by 8 (since for n ≥ 3, 2^n is divisible by 8).\\n\\nWe need to check if there exists a three-digit number with all even digits that is:\\n1. Divisible by 8\\n2. Actually occurs as the last three digits of some power of 2.\\n\\nLet's list all three-digit numbers with all even digits that are divisible by 8:\\nThe even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. We need numbers of the form ABC where A, B, C ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} and 100A+10B+C is divisible by 8.\\n\\nSince 100A ≡ 4A (mod 8) because 100 ≡ 4 mod 8, and 10B ≡ 2B mod 8, we need 4A + 2B + C ≡ 0 mod 8.\\n\\nWe can search systematically. Let's list some: 000, 008, 024, 040, 048, 064",
