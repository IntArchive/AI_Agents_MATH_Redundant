    "Content":"A famous exercise which one encounters while doing Complex Analysis (Residue theory) is to prove that the given integral: $$\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x} x \\,\\mathrm  dx = \\frac \\pi 2$$ Well, can anyone prove this without using Residue theory?  I actually thought of using the series representation of $\\sin x$ : $$\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x} x \\, dx = \\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\int\\limits_0^n \\frac{1}{t} \\left( t - \\frac{t^3}{3!} + \\frac{t^5}{5!} + \\cdots \\right) \\,\\mathrm  dt$$ but I don't see how $\\pi$ comes here, since we need the answer to be equal to $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ .",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here's another way of finishing off Derek's argument. He proves\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin(2n+1)x}{\\sin x}dx=\\frac\\pi2.$$\nLet\n$$I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin(2n+1)x}{x}dx=\n\\int_0^{(2n+1)\\pi\/2}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx.$$\nLet\n$$D_n=\\frac\\pi2-I_n=\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}f(x)\\sin(2n+1)x\\ dx$$\nwhere\n$$f(x)=\\frac1{\\sin x}-\\frac1x.$$\nWe need the fact that if we define $f(0)=0$ then $f$ has a continuous\nderivative on the interval $[0,\\pi\/2]$. Integration by parts yields\n$$D_n=\\frac1{2n+1}\\int_0^{\\pi\/2}f'(x)\\cos(2n+1)x\\ dx=O(1\/n).$$\nHence $I_n\\to\\pi\/2$ and we conclude that\n$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}I_n=\\frac\\pi2.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. The example they provided shows breaking down assumptions and stating the problem clearly.\n\nThe original problem is about evaluating the integral of sin(x)\/x from 0 to infinity being equal to pi\/2 without using residue theory. The user mentioned trying to use the series representation of sin(x) but not seeing how pi comes into play.\n\nFirst, I need to list all assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me parse the question for assumptions.\n\nThe integral is from 0 to infinity. The function is sin(x)\/x. The user wants to prove the result without residue theory. They tried expanding sin(x) as its Taylor series. The problem is to evaluate the integral and show it's pi\/2. The original question also mentions that this is a famous exercise in complex analysis, but the user wants an alternative method.\n\nSo assumptions here would include things like the integral is over [0, ∞), the integrand is sin(x)\/x, and perhaps the restriction to not use residue theory. Also, the approach using the series expansion was attempted. Wait, but in the example given, assumptions were about the variables or conditions on the problem's objects. For instance, in the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7.\n\nIn this integral problem, maybe the assumptions are more about the function and the integral's limits. Let me structure them.\n\nAssumptions could be:\n\n- The integral is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n- The problem requires evaluation without using residue theory.\n- The series representation of sin x is considered.\n\nBut the example had two assumptions, both about n. Here, the problem is to evaluate the integral, so perhaps the key assumptions are the limits of integration and the integrand. The method restriction (no residue theory) is part of the problem statement. Wait, the example includes \"Prove that... is divisible by 91\" and the assumptions are about n being integer and divisible by 7. So the problem includes the divisibility by 91, and the assumptions are the conditions on n.\n\nSimilarly, here the problem is to evaluate the integral as pi\/2, and the assumptions would be the integral's domain and the function. But the question also mentions not using residue theory. Should that be an assumption? In the example, the assumption was about n's properties, which are part of the problem's hypothesis. The method restriction might be part of the problem's constraints but not an assumption per se. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Assumption: All the assumptions of the problem should be listed line by line. Each assumption addresses only one property or condition, applied to one object.\"\n\nSo perhaps the method restriction (no residue theory) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. Assumptions are about the mathematical conditions given in the problem. So in this case:\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The integral is over the interval from 0 to ∞.\n- The integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to evaluate that specific integral. So maybe the problem is just \"Evaluate the integral ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx\" with the answer being pi\/2. But the original question includes the user's attempt using the series expansion. However, according to the example, the assumptions are the conditions given in the problem. Since the integral is given as ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx, the assumptions would be the integral's limits and the integrand. The method restriction (without residue theory) is part of the problem's requirement, so it should be in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, structuring:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is over the interval [0, ∞).\nThe integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx equals π\/2 without using residue theory.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem statement included \"Prove that...\" with the expression. So here, the problem is to evaluate the integral, and the answer is known (pi\/2), so the problem is to prove that it's equal to pi\/2. The original question says \"Evaluating the integral... = pi\/2?\" So the problem is to show the integral equals pi\/2, and the user wants to do it without residue theory. The assumptions are the integral's domain and integrand.\n\nBut I need to make sure each assumption is one line, one property. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe integral is computed over the interval from 0 to ∞.\nThe integrand is (sin x)\/x.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∫₀^∞ (sin x)\/x dx = π\/2 without using residue theory.\n\nThat seems to fit. The example's assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7, each on separate lines. Here, the two main assumptions are the integral's limits and the integrand. The problem statement includes the task and the restriction on method. The user's attempt with the series is part of their approach, not an assumption of the problem itself.\n\nYes, that should be correct. So the formatted problem would list those two assumptions and then the problem statement.",
