    "Content":"Let $ V $ be a normed vector space (over $\\mathbb{R}$, say, for simplicity) with norm $ \\lVert\\cdot\\rVert$. It's not hard to show that if $\\lVert \\cdot \\rVert = \\sqrt{\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle}$ for some (real) inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$, then the parallelogram equality\n$$ 2\\lVert u\\rVert^2 + 2\\lVert v\\rVert^2 = \\lVert u + v\\rVert^2 + \\lVert u - v\\rVert^2 $$\nholds for all pairs $u, v \\in V$.

Assuming the parallelogram identity, I'm able to convince myself that the inner product should be\n$$ \\langle u, v \\rangle = \\frac{\\lVert u\\rVert^2 + \\lVert v\\rVert^2 - \\lVert u - v\\rVert^2}{2} = \\frac{\\lVert u + v\\rVert^2 - \\lVert u\\rVert^2 - \\lVert v\\rVert^2}{2} = \\frac{\\lVert u + v\\rVert^2 - \\lVert u - v\\rVert^2}{4} $$ I cannot seem to get that $\\langle \\lambda u,v \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle u,v \\rangle$ for $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

    "AcceptedAnswer":"It's not immediate or trivial, so I wouldn't feel too bad for having trouble. This is an exercise in Friedberg, Insel, and Spence's Linear Algebra , 4th Edition, which has an extensive 8 part \"Hint.\" Here's an edited sequence of hints, following theirs: First, prove that the result holds for $\\lambda = 2$, that is, $\\langle 2u,v\\rangle = 2\\langle u,v\\rangle$. Then, prove that the inner product is additive in the first component: $\\langle x+u,v\\rangle = \\langle x,v\\rangle + \\langle u,v\\rangle$. Then, prove the result holds for $\\lambda$ any positive integer. Then for the reciprocal $\\frac{1}{m}$ of any positive integer. Then for any rational number. Then prove that $|\\langle u,v\\rangle|\\leq ||u||\\,||v||$ Then prove that for every $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, every $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, you have\n$$|\\lambda\\langle u,v\\rangle - \\langle \\lambda  u,v\\rangle | = |(\\lambda-r)\\langle u,v\\rangle - \\langle(\\lambda-r)u,v\\rangle|\\leq 2|\\lambda-r|\\,||u||\\,||v||.$$ Finally, use that to prove homogeneity: for every $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $\\langle\\lambda u,v\\rangle = \\lambda\\langle u,v\\rangle$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the user's format. First, I need to identify all the assumptions and then clearly state the problem.\n\nThe original question is about proving that if a norm satisfies the parallelogram law, then it is induced by an inner product. Specifically, the user is struggling with showing that the defined inner product is linear in the first argument, particularly scalar multiplication: ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩.\n\nFirst, let's list the assumptions. The problem is set in a normed vector space V over ℝ. The norm is given, and it satisfies the parallelogram identity for all pairs of vectors u and v. The user has already derived expressions for the inner product using the norm and needs to prove the scalar multiplication property.\n\nAssumptions should be one per line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So:\n\n1. V is a normed vector space over ℝ.\n2. The norm ||·|| on V satisfies the parallelogram law for all u, v ∈ V.\n3. The inner product ⟨u, v⟩ is defined as (||u + v||² - ||u - v||²)\/4.\n\nWait, in the problem description, the user shows multiple equivalent expressions for the inner product. However, the key is that they are using one of these definitions, so maybe the assumption is that ⟨u, v⟩ is defined by that formula. Also, the norm is given, and the parallelogram law holds. The problem is to prove that this inner product is linear in the first argument, specifically scalar multiplication.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- V is a real normed vector space.\n- The norm on V satisfies the parallelogram law for all pairs of vectors u and v.\n- The inner product is defined by ⟨u, v⟩ = (||u + v||² - ||u - v||²)\/4.\n\nBut the user is having trouble proving that ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩ for real scalars λ. So the problem is to prove that this defined inner product is linear in the first argument, specifically the scalar multiplication part.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should list these assumptions and then state the problem as proving the scalar linearity.\n\nBut let me check the example provided. In the example, the original problem had an extra assumption (n divisible by 7) which wasn't in the original problem. Wait, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Wait, no, maybe the example was modified. Wait, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. That seems incorrect. Maybe the example is wrong, but the user provided it as their own formatting. So perhaps in their example, they mistakenly added an assumption not present. But in the actual task, we need to filter out unrelated information and list the correct assumptions.\n\nIn the current problem, the original question states that V is a normed vector space over ℝ, the norm satisfies the parallelogram law for all u, v, and they have defined the inner product using the given formula. The problem is to prove that this inner product is linear in scalar multiplication, i.e., ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩ for λ ∈ ℝ.\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n- V is a real normed vector space.\n- The norm ||·|| on V satisfies the parallelogram law for all u, v ∈ V.\n- The inner product ⟨u, v⟩ is defined as (||u + v||² - ||u - v||²)\/4.\n\nThe problem is to prove that for any real scalar λ and vectors u, v ∈ V, ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩.\n\nWait, but the user's original question also mentions that they can't prove ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩. So the problem is precisely to prove that scalar multiplication property for the defined inner product.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nV is a real normed vector space,\nThe norm ||·|| satisfies the parallelogram law for all u, v ∈ V,\nThe inner product is defined as ⟨u, v⟩ = (||u + v||² - ||u - v||²)\/4.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ⟨λu, v⟩ = λ⟨u, v⟩ for all λ ∈ ℝ and u, v ∈ V.\n\nBut the user's example seems to have split assumptions into separate lines, each as one condition applied to one object. So perhaps each assumption line should be one condition. For instance, \"V is a real normed vector space\" is one line, \"The norm ||·|| satisfies the parallelogram law for all u, v ∈ V\" another, and \"The inner product is defined as ⟨u, v⟩ = (||u + v||² - ||u - v||²)\/4\" as the third.\n\nSo the formatted answer should look like:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$V$ is a real normed vector space,\nThe norm $\\lVert\\cdot\\rVert$ satisfies the parallelogram law for all $u, v \\in V$,\nThe inner product is defined as $\\langle u, v \\rangle = \\frac{\\lVert u + v\\rVert^2 - \\lVert u - v\\rVert^2}{4}$.\nProblem:\nProve that $\\langle \\lambda u, v \\rangle = \\lambda \\langle u, v \\rangle$ for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $u, v \\in V$.\n###",
