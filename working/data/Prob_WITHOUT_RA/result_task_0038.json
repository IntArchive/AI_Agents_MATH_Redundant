    "AcceptedAnswer":"$$|x| + |y -x| \\ge |x + y -x| = |y|$$ $$|y| + |x -y| \\ge |y + x -y| = |x|$$ Move $|x|$ to the right hand side in the first inequality and $|y|$ to the right hand side in the second inequality. We get $$|y -x| \\ge |y| - |x|$$ $$|x -y| \\ge |x| -|y|.$$ From absolute value properties, we know that $|y-x| = |x-y|,$ and if $t \\ge a$ and $t \\ge −a$ then $t \\ge |a|$ . Combining these two facts together, we get the reverse triangle inequality: $$|x-y| \\ge \\bigl||x|-|y|\\bigr|.$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to prove the reverse triangle inequality, ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|, using only the standard triangle inequality which states |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the triangle inequality and think about how to manipulate it to get the reverse form. The reverse triangle inequality deals with the absolute difference of the magnitudes of x and y, so maybe I can express |x| and |y| in terms of each other using the triangle inequality.\n\nLet me start by considering |x| = |x - y + y|. Applying the triangle inequality here, we get |x| ≤ |x - y| + |y|. If I rearrange this inequality, it becomes |x| - |y| ≤ |x - y|. Similarly, if I switch x and y, I have |y| - |x| ≤ |y - x|. Since |y - x| is the same as |x - y|, this simplifies to |y| - |x| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nCombining these two results, we see that both |x| - |y| and |y| - |x| are less than or equal to |x - y|. The maximum of these two expressions is exactly ||x| - |y||, which means that ||x| - |y|| ≤ |x - y|. \n\nWait, but does this cover all cases? Let me check with some examples. Suppose x and y are both positive. If x > y, then |x| - |y| = x - y, and |x - y| is x - y, so equality holds. If y > x, then |y| - |x| = y - x, which is equal to |x - y|. So in these cases, the inequality holds as equality. What if one is positive and the other negative? Let's say x is positive and y is negative. Then |x| - |y| would be x - (-y) if y is negative, but wait, y is negative so |y| = -y. So |x| - |y| is x - (-y) = x + y. But |x - y| would be |x - (-|y|)| = |x + |y||, which is x + |y| since both are positive. So |x| - |y| = x + y (if y is negative) compared to |x - y| = x + |y|. Wait, if y is negative, then |y| = -y, so |x - y| = x - y (since y is negative, subtracting a negative is adding). But x - y would be x + |y|. So |x| - |y| = x - |y|. So x - |y| ≤ x + |y|, which is always true because |y| is non-negative. But this seems like a different approach. Maybe my initial approach still holds. \n\nAlternatively, another way is to note that ||x| - |y|| is the maximum of |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and both are less than or equal to |x - y| as per the triangle inequality applications. Therefore, combining these gives the desired result. \n\nSo the key steps are applying the triangle inequality to |x| and |y| by expressing them as |x - y + y| and |y - x + x|, then rearranging to get inequalities involving |x| - |y| and |y| - |x|, and finally recognizing that the absolute value of their difference is bounded by |x - y|.",

Since y < 0, x+y < x = |x| ≤ |x|+|y|.\nStep 6) For subcase (b): x+y < 0, then |x+y| = -(x+y) = -x - y. Since x ≥ 0, -x ≤ 0 ≤ |x|, and since y < 0, -y = |y|.

Therefore:\n|x + y| = x + y\nAlso, since x ≥ 0, |x| = x, and since y ≥ 0, |y| = y.\nThus: |x + y| = x + y = |x| + |y|\nSo the inequality holds with equality.\n\n**Case 2: x ≥ 0 and y < 0**\nHere x ≥ 0, so |x| = x, and y < 0, so |y| = -y.\nWe need to consider two subcases based on the sign of x + y:\n\n*Subcase 2a: x + y ≥ 0*\nThen |x + y| = x + y.\nSince y < 0, we have x + y < x = |x|.\nBut |x| ≤ |x| + |y| because |y| = -y > 0.\nThus: |x + y| = x + y < x = |x| ≤ |x| + |y|\n\n*Subcase 2b: x + y < 0*\nThen |x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y.\nSince x ≥ 0, we have -x ≤ 0 ≤ |x|.\nSince y < 0, we have -y = |y|.\nThus: |x + y| = -x - y = -x + (-y) = -x + |y| ≤ |x| + |y|\nbecause -x ≤ |x| and |y| = |y|.\n\n**Case 3: x < 0 and y ≥ 0**\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2 by swapping the roles of x and y. The proof follows exactly the same logic as Case 2, with x and y interchanged.\n\n**Case 4: x < 0 and y < 0**\nSince both x and y are negative, x + y < 0. Therefore:\n|x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y\nSince x < 0, |x| = -x, and since y < 0, |y| = -y.\nThus: |x + y| = -x - y = |x| + |y|\nSo the inequality holds with equality.\n\nSince these four cases cover all possible sign combinations for real numbers x and y, we have shown that |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| for all real x and y.\n\n**Proof Approach 2: Algebraic Proof**\n\nAn alternative proof uses the fact that for any real number a, |a|² = a².\n\nConsider:\n|x + y|² = (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²\n\nNow, note that xy ≤ |xy| = |x||y|, since for any real numbers a and b, ab ≤ |ab| = |a||b|.\nTherefore:\nx² + 2xy + y² ≤ x² + 2|x||y| + y²\n\nBut x² = |x|² and y² = |y|², so:\n|x + y|² ≤ |x|² + 2|x||y| + |y|² = (|x| + |y|)²\n\nSince both |x + y|² and (|x| + |y|)² are non-negative, we can take square roots (preserving the inequality because the square root function is increasing on non-negative numbers):\n|x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nBoth proof approaches establish the Triangle Inequality for all real numbers x and y.",
