The problem is asking to prove that every prime ideal falls into one of these four categories. But the way the assumptions are written, they're not really \"assumptions\" in the logical sense - they're descriptions of the four cases. \n\nActually, looking at Assumption 4: \"The prime ideal is generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X) that is irreducible modulo p.\" This is indeed a prime ideal. But is this assumption redundant in the sense that it follows from the structure of ℤ[X]?\n\nLet me think about the classification theorem. In ℤ[X], prime ideals come in three heights:\n- Height 0: (0)\n- Height 1: (f) where f irreducible, or (p) where p prime\n- Height 2: (p, f) where p prime and f irreducible mod p\n\nSo all four are distinct cases. However, I notice something: In Assumption 4, it says \"generated by a prime number p and a polynomial f(X)\". But if f(X) is irreducible modulo p, then (p, f(X)) is indeed prime. But could this be considered redundant because it's essentially the \"maximal\" case?\n\nActually, I think there might be redundancy between Assumptions 2 and 3. Both describe principal prime ideals. But they're different because one is generated by a polynomial and one by an integer. However, in ℤ[X], if a principal ideal (g) is prime, then either:\n1. g is an irreducible polynomial (Assumption 2)\n2. g is a prime integer (Assumption 3)\n\nSo these are two distinct cases of principal prime ideals.\n\n**Step 5: Checking for logical redundancy**\n\nLet me think: If we have Assumption 2 (principal ideal generated by irreducible polynomial) and Assumption 3 (principal ideal generated by prime number), do we need both? Yes, because they describe different mathematical objects.\n\nWhat about Assumption 4? It describes non-principal prime ideals. We need this case too.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the phrasing. The problem says \"Prove that every prime ideal of ℤ[X] is one of the listed types.\" The \"listed types\" are given as Assumptions 1-4. So we need to prove the classification theorem.\n\nI don't think any of these is logically redundant in the sense that we can deduce one from the others. They're four distinct cases in the classification.\n\nHowever, let me check if maybe Assumption 4 implies something about the others? No.\n\nActually, I think I need to answer Q1: \"Does the problem have a redundant assumption?\" Based on my analysis, I believe the answer is no.

ℤ[X] is the polynomial ring in one variable over the PID ℤ.\\n\\n**Step 2: General theorem for polynomial rings over PIDs**\\nFor any PID R, the prime ideals of the polynomial ring R[X] are classified as follows:\\n(i) The zero ideal (0).\\n(ii) Principal ideals (f) where f is an irreducible polynomial in R[X].\\n(iii) Principal ideals (p) where p is a prime element in R.\\n(iv) Ideals of the form (p, f) where p is a prime in R and f is a polynomial in R[X] that is irreducible modulo p (i.e., irreducible in (R/(p))[X]).\\n\\n**Step 3: Application to ℤ[X]**\\nTaking R = ℤ, we obtain the four types of prime ideals listed in the problem statement.\\n\\n**Step 4: The zero ideal (0) is prime**\\nSince ℤ[X] is an integral domain (the product of two nonzero polynomials is nonzero), the zero ideal (0) is prime by definition.\\n\\n**Step 5: Principal ideals generated by irreducible polynomials**\\nLet f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] be an irreducible polynomial. To show (f) is prime, suppose g(X)h(X) ∈ (f). Then f divides gh in ℤ[X]. Since f is irreducible and ℤ[X] is a UFD (unique factorization domain), f must divide g or f must divide h. Thus g ∈ (f) or h ∈ (f), proving (f) is prime.\\n\\n**Step 6: Principal ideals generated by prime numbers**\\nLet p be a prime integer. Consider the ideal (p) in ℤ[X]. The quotient ℤ[X]/(p) ≅ (ℤ/pℤ)[X], which is an integral domain since ℤ/pℤ is a field. Therefore, (p) is a prime ideal.\\n\\n**Step 7: Ideals of the form (p, f(X)) where f is irreducible modulo p**\\nLet p be a prime integer and f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] a polynomial such that its reduction modulo p, denoted f̄(X) ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X], is irreducible. Consider the ideal I = (p, f(X)).\\n\\nFirst, we show I is prime. The quotient ℤ[X]/I ≅ (ℤ/pℤ)[X]/(f̄(X)). Since f̄(X) is irreducible over the field ℤ/pℤ, the ideal (f̄(X)) is maximal, hence prime. Thus (ℤ/pℤ)[X]/(f̄(X)) is a field, and therefore ℤ[X]/I is an integral domain, proving I is prime.\\n\\nSecond, we show I is non-principal. Suppose for contradiction that I = (g(X)) for some g(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Since p ∈ I, we have p = g(X)h(X) for some h(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Comparing degrees, deg(g) + deg(h) = 0, so both g and h are constant polynomials. Thus g is a constant divisor of p, so g = ±1 or g = ±p. If g = ±1, then I = ℤ[X], contradicting that I is prime (and proper). If g = ±p, then I = (p). But f(X) ∈ I = (p) implies p divides f(X), so f̄(X) = 0 in (ℤ/pℤ)[X], contradicting that f̄(X) is irreducible (hence nonzero). Therefore I cannot be principal.\\n\\n**Step 8: Completeness proof**\\nWe now prove that any prime ideal P in ℤ[X] must be one of the four types. Consider the contraction P ∩ ℤ. Since ℤ is a PID, P ∩ ℤ is an ideal of ℤ, hence of the form (0) or (p) for some prime p.\\n\\n**Step 9: Case P ∩ ℤ = (0)**\\nIf P ∩ ℤ = (0), then P contains no nonzero integers. Consider the localization ℤ[X]_{ℤ\\\\{0\\}} = ℚ[X]. Since P ∩ ℤ = (0), the extension Pℚ[X] is a prime ideal in ℚ[X]. Since ℚ is a field, ℚ[X] is a PID, so Pℚ[X] = (g(X)) for some irreducible polynomial g(X) ∈ ℚ[X]. Clearing denominators, we may assume g(X) ∈ ℤ[X] is primitive (content 1). Then P = (g(X)) ∩ ℤ[X]. Since P is prime and contains g(X), and (g(X)) is a nonzero prime ideal contained in P, we must have P = (g(X)). Thus P is of type 2.\\n\\n**Step 10: Case P ∩ ℤ = (p) for some prime p**\\nIf P ∩ ℤ = (p), then p ∈ P. Consider the reduction map φ: ℤ[X] → (ℤ/pℤ)[X]. The image φ(P) is a prime ideal in (ℤ/pℤ)[X] since P is prime and contains p. Since (ℤ/pℤ) is a field, (ℤ/pℤ)[X] is a PID, so φ(P) = (f̄(X)) for some irreducible polynomial f̄(X) ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X].\\n\\nLet f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] be any lift of f̄(X). Then f(X) ∈ P since φ(f) = f̄ ∈ φ(P). Thus (p, f(X)) ⊆ P. Conversely, for any g(X) ∈ P, φ(g) ∈ φ(P) = (f̄), so φ(g) = f̄·h̄ for some h̄ ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X]. Lifting, we have g(X) = f(X)h(X) + p·k(X) for some h(X), k(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Thus g ∈ (p, f(X)). Hence P = (p, f(X)).\\n\\nNow we have two subcases:\\n- If f̄(X) is a unit (nonzero constant), then φ(P) = (1), so P contains 1, contradicting that P is proper. Thus f̄(X) is non-constant.\\n- If f̄(X) is irreducible (as we already have), then P is of type 4.\\n- If f̄(X) = 0, then φ(P) = (0), so P ⊆ (p). Since p ∈ P and P is prime, we must have P = (p) (type 3).\\n\\nThus in all cases, P is one of the four types.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Every prime ideal in ℤ[X] is exactly one of: (0), (f) with f irreducible in ℤ[X], (p) with p prime in ℤ, or (p, f) with p prime in ℤ and f irreducible modulo p. Moreover, ideals of the last type are non-principal.\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"

ℤ[X] is the polynomial ring in one variable over the PID ℤ.\\n\\n**Step 2: General theorem for polynomial rings over PIDs**\\nFor any PID R, the prime ideals of the polynomial ring R[X] are classified as follows:\\n(i) The zero ideal (0).\\n(ii) Principal ideals (f) where f is an irreducible polynomial in R[X].\\n(iii) Principal ideals (p) where p is a prime element in R.\\n(iv) Ideals of the form (p, f) where p is a prime in R and f is a polynomial in R[X] that is irreducible modulo p (i.e., irreducible in (R/(p))[X]).\\n\\n**Step 3: Application to ℤ[X]**\\nTaking R = ℤ, we obtain the four types of prime ideals listed in the problem statement.\\n\\n**Step 4: The zero ideal (0) is prime**\\nSince ℤ[X] is an integral domain (the product of two nonzero polynomials is nonzero), the zero ideal (0) is prime by definition.\\n\\n**Step 5: Principal ideals generated by irreducible polynomials**\\nLet f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] be an irreducible polynomial. To show (f) is prime, suppose g(X)h(X) ∈ (f). Then f divides gh in ℤ[X]. Since f is irreducible and ℤ[X] is a UFD (unique factorization domain), f must divide g or f must divide h. Thus g ∈ (f) or h ∈ (f), proving (f) is prime.\\n\\n**Step 6: Principal ideals generated by prime numbers**\\nLet p be a prime integer. Consider the ideal (p) in ℤ[X]. The quotient ℤ[X]/(p) ≅ (ℤ/pℤ)[X], which is an integral domain since ℤ/pℤ is a field. Therefore, (p) is a prime ideal.\\n\\n**Step 7: Ideals of the form (p, f(X)) where f is irreducible modulo p**\\nLet p be a prime integer and f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] a polynomial such that its reduction modulo p, denoted f̄(X) ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X], is irreducible. Consider the ideal I = (p, f(X)).\\n\\nFirst, we show I is prime. The quotient ℤ[X]/I ≅ (ℤ/pℤ)[X]/(f̄(X)). Since f̄(X) is irreducible over the field ℤ/pℤ, the ideal (f̄(X)) is maximal, hence prime. Thus (ℤ/pℤ)[X]/(f̄(X)) is a field, and therefore ℤ[X]/I is an integral domain, proving I is prime.\\n\\nSecond, we show I is non-principal. Suppose for contradiction that I = (g(X)) for some g(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Since p ∈ I, we have p = g(X)h(X) for some h(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Comparing degrees, deg(g) + deg(h) = 0, so both g and h are constant polynomials. Thus g is a constant divisor of p, so g = ±1 or g = ±p. If g = ±1, then I = ℤ[X], contradicting that I is prime (and proper). If g = ±p, then I = (p). But f(X) ∈ I = (p) implies p divides f(X), so f̄(X) = 0 in (ℤ/pℤ)[X], contradicting that f̄(X) is irreducible (hence nonzero). Therefore I cannot be principal.\\n\\n**Step 8: Completeness proof**\\nWe now prove that any prime ideal P in ℤ[X] must be one of the four types. Consider the contraction P ∩ ℤ. Since ℤ is a PID, P ∩ ℤ is an ideal of ℤ, hence of the form (0) or (p) for some prime p.\\n\\n**Step 9: Case P ∩ ℤ = (0)**\\nIf P ∩ ℤ = (0), then P contains no nonzero integers. Consider the localization ℤ[X]_{ℤ\\\\{0\\}} = ℚ[X]. Since P ∩ ℤ = (0), the extension Pℚ[X] is a prime ideal in ℚ[X]. Since ℚ is a field, ℚ[X] is a PID, so Pℚ[X] = (g(X)) for some irreducible polynomial g(X) ∈ ℚ[X]. Clearing denominators, we may assume g(X) ∈ ℤ[X] is primitive (content 1). Then P = (g(X)) ∩ ℤ[X]. Since P is prime and contains g(X), and (g(X)) is a nonzero prime ideal contained in P, we must have P = (g(X)). Thus P is of type 2.\\n\\n**Step 10: Case P ∩ ℤ = (p) for some prime p**\\nIf P ∩ ℤ = (p), then p ∈ P. Consider the reduction map φ: ℤ[X] → (ℤ/pℤ)[X]. The image φ(P) is a prime ideal in (ℤ/pℤ)[X] since P is prime and contains p. Since (ℤ/pℤ) is a field, (ℤ/pℤ)[X] is a PID, so φ(P) = (f̄(X)) for some irreducible polynomial f̄(X) ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X].\\n\\nLet f(X) ∈ ℤ[X] be any lift of f̄(X). Then f(X) ∈ P since φ(f) = f̄ ∈ φ(P). Thus (p, f(X)) ⊆ P. Conversely, for any g(X) ∈ P, φ(g) ∈ φ(P) = (f̄), so φ(g) = f̄·h̄ for some h̄ ∈ (ℤ/pℤ)[X]. Lifting, we have g(X) = f(X)h(X) + p·k(X) for some h(X), k(X) ∈ ℤ[X]. Thus g ∈ (p, f(X)). Hence P = (p, f(X)).\\n\\nNow we have two subcases:\\n- If f̄(X) is a unit (nonzero constant), then φ(P) = (1), so P contains 1, contradicting that P is proper.
