Let A be the point (1,0) on the positive x-axis. For a small positive angle x (in radians), draw radius OB making an angle x with OA, where B lies on the unit circle. Since the circle has radius 1, we have OA = OB = 1.\\n\\n**Step 2: Construction of Right Triangles**\\nFrom point B, drop a perpendicular to the x-axis, meeting it at point C.

Let A be the point (1,0) on the positive x-axis. For a small positive angle x (in radians), draw radius OB making an angle x with OA, where B lies on the unit circle. Since the circle has radius 1, we have OA = OB = 1.\n\n**Step 2: Construction of Right Triangles**\nFrom point B, drop a perpendicular to the x-axis, meeting it at point C. Triangle OBC is a right triangle with:\n- Hypotenuse OB = 1 (radius of unit circle)\n- Opposite side BC = sin(x) (by definition of sine in right triangle)\n- Adjacent side OC = cos(x) (by definition of cosine in right triangle)\n\nNow draw the tangent line to the circle at point A. Extend radius OB to meet this tangent line at point D. Triangle OAD is a right triangle with:\n- Side OA = 1 (radius)\n- Angle AOD = x\n- Opposite side AD = tan(x) (by definition of tangent in right triangle)\n\n**Step 3: Area Calculations**\nWe compute the areas of three regions:\n1. Area of triangle OBC = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × sin(x) = (1/2)sin(x)\n2. Area of sector OAB = (1/2) × radius² × angle = (1/2) × 1² × x = x/2\n3. Area of triangle OAD = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × tan(x) = (1/2)tan(x)\n\n**Step 4: Area Inequality**\nVisually, for 0 < x < π/2, we observe that:\nArea(triangle OBC) < Area(sector OAB) < Area(triangle OAD)\nThis gives us the inequality:\n(1/2)sin(x) < x/2 < (1/2)tan(x)\n\n**Step 5: Algebraic Manipulation**\nMultiplying all parts by 2:\nsin(x) < x < tan(x)\n\nFor x > 0, we can divide by sin(x) (which is positive for 0 < x < π/2):\n1 < x/sin(x) < tan(x)/sin(x) = 1/cos(x)\n\nTaking reciprocals (and reversing inequality signs):\ncos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1\n\n**Step 6: Extension to Negative x**\nFor x < 0, note that sin(-x) = -sin(x) and cos(-x) = cos(x). Then:\nsin(x)/x = sin(-x)/(-x) = [sin(-x)/(-x)]\nSince -x > 0, we can apply the same inequality:\ncos(-x) < sin(-x)/(-x) < 1\nBut cos(-x) = cos(x), so:\ncos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1 for x < 0 as well.\n\nThus, for all x ≠ 0 sufficiently close to 0, we have:\ncos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1\n\n**Step 7: Application of Squeeze Theorem**\nWe know from basic geometric properties of cosine that lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1. This can be established without Taylor series by observing that as x→0, point B approaches point A on the unit circle, so cos(x) = OC approaches OA = 1.\n\nNow we have three functions:\nf(x) = cos(x), g(x) = sin(x)/x, h(x) = 1\n\nFor x near 0 (x ≠ 0), we have:\nf(x) < g(x) < h(x)\n\nAs x→0:\nlim_{x→0} f(x) = lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1\nlim_{x→0} h(x) = lim_{x→0} 1 = 1\n\nBy the squeeze theorem:\nlim_{x→0} g(x) = lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1\n\n**Step 8: Verification of No Taylor Series Usage**\nThis proof uses only:\n1. Geometric constructions (unit circle, triangles, sector)\n2. Basic trigonometric definitions (sin, cos, tan as ratios in right triangles)\n3. Area formulas for triangles and circular sectors\n4. Algebraic manipulation of inequalities\n5. The squeeze theorem\n6. The limit property lim_{x→0} cos(x) = 1, which follows from the geometric definition of cosine on the unit circle\n\nNo Taylor series expansions of sin(x), cos(x), or tan(x) are used at any point. The proof is entirely geometric and algebraic, relying on the geometric definitions of trigonometric functions rather than their power series representations.\n\nThus, we have proven lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1 using a geometric approach that does not involve Taylor series expansions of sin, cos, or tan."

Draw radius OA along positive x-axis. Draw radius OB making angle x (in radians) with OA, where x > 0 is small.\nStep 2) Draw perpendicular from B to x-axis, meeting at C. Triangle OBC is a right triangle with hypotenuse OB = 1, opposite side BC = sin(x), and adjacent side OC = cos(x).\nStep 3) Draw tangent line at A, meeting extended OB at D. Triangle OAD is a right triangle with OA = 1, angle AOD = x, so AD = tan(x).\nStep 4) Compare areas: Area of triangle OBC = (1/2)·1·sin(x) = (1/2)sin(x). Area of sector OAB = (1/2)·1²·x = x/2. Area of triangle OAD = (1/2)·1·tan(x) = (1/2)tan(x).\nStep 5) Establish inequality: Area(triangle OBC) < Area(sector OAB) < Area(triangle OAD). This gives: (1/2)sin(x) < x/2 < (1/2)tan(x).\nStep 6) Multiply by 2: sin(x) < x < tan(x). For x > 0, divide by sin(x): 1 < x/sin(x) < 1/cos(x). Take reciprocals: cos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1.\nStep 7) For x < 0, use symmetry: sin(-x)/(-x) = sin(x)/x and cos(-x) = cos(x). So inequality holds for all x ≠ 0 near 0.\nStep 8) Apply squeeze theorem: As x→0, cos(x)→1. Since cos(x) < sin(x)/x < 1 and both bounds approach 1, lim_{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1.\nStep 9) Note: This proof uses only geometric constructions (unit circle, triangles, sector), area comparisons, basic trigonometric definitions (sin, cos, tan as ratios in right triangles), and the squeeze theorem.
