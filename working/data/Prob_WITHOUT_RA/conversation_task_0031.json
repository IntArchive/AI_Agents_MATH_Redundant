Define the 10-adic absolute value as $|n|_{10} = 10^{-m}$. For $n = 0$, define $|0|_{10} = 0$. This satisfies the properties of an absolute value: (1) $|x|_{10} \\geq 0$ with equality iff $x = 0$, (2) $|xy|_{10} = |x|_{10}|y|_{10}$, and (3) $|x+y|_{10} \\leq \\max(|x|_{10}, |y|_{10})$ (ultrametric inequality). In particular, $|10|_{10} = 1/10 < 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Consider partial sums**\nDefine the partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} 9 \\cdot 10^k$. Using the formula for a finite geometric series:\n$$S_n = 9 \\cdot \\frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{10 - 1} = 10^{n+1} - 1$$\n\n**Step 3: Show $\\{S_n\\}$ is Cauchy in the 10-adic metric**\nFor $m > n$, we have:\n$$S_m - S_n = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} 9 \\cdot 10^k = 9 \\cdot 10^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{10^{m-n} - 1}{9} = 10^{n+1}(10^{m-n} - 1)$$\nSince $10^{m-n} - 1$ is an integer, the highest power of 10 dividing $S_m - S_n$ is at least $10^{n+1}$. Therefore:\n$$|S_m - S_n|_{10} = |10^{n+1}(10^{m-n} - 1)|_{10} = |10^{n+1}|_{10} \\cdot |10^{m-n} - 1|_{10} \\leq 10^{-(n+1)}$$\nbecause $|10^{m-n} - 1|_{10} \\leq 1$ (since it's an integer not necessarily divisible by 10). As $n \\to \\infty$, $10^{-(n+1)} \\to 0$, so $|S_m - S_n|_{10} \\to 0$ as $m,n \\to \\infty$. Thus $\\{S_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the 10-adic metric.\n\n**Step 4: Convergence in the complete 10-adic space**\nThe 10-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_{10}$ form a complete metric space with respect to the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|_{10}$. Since $\\{S_n\\}$ is Cauchy in this complete space, it converges to some limit $L \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{10}$.\n\n**Step 5: Represent the limit**\nThe limit $L$ corresponds to the infinite expansion $\\ldots 9999$, where we have infinitely many 9's to the left. Formally, $L = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (10^{n+1} - 1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Algebraic manipulation**\nConsider $10L$. Multiplying the expansion $\\ldots 9999$ by 10 gives $\\ldots 99990$ (shift left by one digit, appending 0). Thus:\n$$10L = \\ldots 99990$$\nNow compute $L - 10L$:\n$$L - 10L = \\ldots 9999 - \\ldots 99990$$\nSubtracting digit by digit from the right:\n- Units digit: $9 - 0 = 9$\n- Tens digit: $9 - 9 = 0$  \n- Hundreds digit: $9 - 9 = 0$\n- All higher digits: $9 - 9 = 0$\nThus $L - 10L = 9$ (with all higher digits being 0).\n\n**Step 7: Solve for L**\nWe have $L - 10L = 9$, which simplifies to $-9L = 9$, so $L = -1$.\n\n**Alternative verification**: Consider $L + 1$:\n$$L + 1 = \\ldots 9999 + 1$$\nAdding from the right: $9 + 1 = 10$ (write 0, carry 1), then $9 + 1 = 10$ (write 0, carry 1), and so on indefinitely. All digits become 0 with a carry that propagates forever, giving $L + 1 = 0$, so $L = -1$.\n\n**Step 8: Conclusion**\nTherefore, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} 9 \\cdot 10^k = L = -1$ in the 10-adic number system.
