Behavior near x = 0:\\n   As x → 0⁺, the integrand behaves like:\\n   x^α/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) ∼ x^α/(1) = x^α.\\n   For convergence at the lower limit (x = 0), we need ∫₀^ε x^α dx to converge for some ε > 0.\\n   This requires α > -1.

This condition is also given (α ∈ (-1, 1)), so it's satisfied.\\n\\n3. Behavior at finite positive x:\\n   The denominator D(x) = 1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² must not vanish for any x ≥ 0, otherwise the integrand would have a pole on the path of integration, causing divergence.\\n   \\n   Analyze D(x):\\n   D(x) = 1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² = (x + cos(πβ))² + 1 - cos²(πβ) = (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ).\\n   \\n   For x ≥ 0, D(x) = 0 if and only if:\\n   (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ) = 0.\\n   Since both terms are non-negative, this requires:\\n   (x + cos(πβ))² = 0 AND sin²(πβ) = 0.\\n   \\n   The first condition gives x = -cos(πβ).\\n   The second condition gives sin(πβ) = 0, i.e., πβ = kπ for some integer k, or β = k.\\n   \\n   For x = -cos(πβ) to be ≥ 0, we need -cos(πβ) ≥ 0, i.e., cos(πβ) ≤ 0.\\n   \\n   Combining conditions:\\n   - β = k (integer)\\n   - cos(πβ) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k ≤ 0\\n   \\n   This means (-1)^k ≤ 0, which occurs when k is odd (since (-1)^k = -1 for odd k).\\n   \\n   Therefore, D(x) = 0 for some x ≥ 0 if and only if β is an odd integer.\\n   \\n   However, we need a stronger condition. Let's examine what happens when |β| ≥ 1.\\n   \\n   Case 1: β ≥ 1\\n   - If β = 1, then πβ = π, cos(π) = -1, sin(π) = 0.\\n     Then D(x) = 1 - 2x + x² = (x - 1)².\\n     At x = 1, D(1) = 0, so the integrand has a pole at x = 1, causing divergence.\\n   - If β > 1, say β = 1 + δ with δ > 0, then πβ = π + πδ.\\n     cos(πβ) = cos(π + πδ) = -cos(πδ).\\n     sin(πβ) = sin(π + πδ) = -sin(πδ).\\n     For small δ > 0, cos(πδ) ≈ 1, sin(πδ) ≈ πδ.\\n     Then D(x) = 1 - 2x cos(πδ) + x² ≈ 1 - 2x + x² = (x - 1)² for small δ.\\n     The minimum occurs near x = 1, with value approximately sin²(πδ) ≈ (πδ)² > 0.\\n     So technically D(x) > 0 for all x ≥ 0 when β > 1 (not an integer).\\n     \\n   Case 2: β ≤ -1\\n   - If β = -1, then πβ = -π, cos(-π) = -1, sin(-π) = 0.\\n     Same as β = 1 case: pole at x = 1.\\n   - If β < -1, similar analysis shows D(x) > 0 for all x ≥ 0.\\n   \\n   However, there's another crucial consideration. The integral f(α, β) is likely part of a symmetric relationship. Consider the symmetric expression:\\n   f(β, α) = ∫₀^∞ x^β/(1 + 2x cos(πα) + x²) dx.\\n   \\n   For f(β, α) to be defined (if we want to discuss it or prove f(α, β) = f(β, α)), we need the same convergence conditions applied to β:\\n   - Near x = 0: need β > -1\\n   - As x → ∞: need β < 1\\n   \\n   Therefore, for f(β, α) to converge, we need β ∈ (-1, 1).\\n   \\n   Since the problem context (though not explicitly stated) typically involves proving symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α), and since f(α, β) is given as defined with α ∈ (-1, 1), for the symmetry to make sense, f(β, α) must also be defined, which requires β ∈ (-1, 1).\\n   \\n   Moreover, even without assuming symmetry, if we require the integral f(α, β) to be well-behaved (analytic in parameters), we typically want the denominator to be positive for all x ≥ 0. The condition |β| < 1 ensures that:\\n   - When cos(πβ) < 0, we have sin²(πβ) > 0 (since |β| < 1 ⇒ π|β| < π ⇒ πβ is not an integer multiple of π)\\n   - Thus D(x) = (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ) ≥ sin²(πβ) > 0 for all x ≥ 0.\\n   \\n   In contrast, if |β| ≥ 1, then either:\\n   - β = ±1 gives D(1) = 0 (pole at x = 1)\\n   - |β| > 1 gives D(x) > 0 but the parameter β is outside the natural domain where the integral representation is typically considered.\\n   \\n   Therefore, from the convergence requirements and the natural domain of such integral representations, we conclude that β must satisfy β ∈ (-1, 1).\\n\\nThus, given α ∈ (-1, 1) and f(α, β) defined, we have proven that β ∈ (-1, 1).\"\n}\n###END_OF_FORMAT###"
