Let f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ be a homeomorphism with inverse g: ℝᵐ → ℝⁿ.\\n\\n**Step 2: Remove a point from ℝⁿ**\\nConsider ℝⁿ with the origin 0 removed: ℝⁿ \\\\ {0}.

Then:\\nℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {p}\\n\\n**Step 3: Use homogeneity of ℝᵐ**\\nThe Euclidean space ℝᵐ is homogeneous: for any two points p, q ∈ ℝᵐ, there exists a homeomorphism h: ℝᵐ → ℝᵐ such that h(p) = q.

The proof uses algebraic topology, specifically homology theory.\\n\\n**Step 1: Setup and assumption for contradiction**\\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that ℝⁿ ≅ ℝᵐ (i.e., ℝⁿ and ℝᵐ are homeomorphic). Let f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ be a homeomorphism with inverse g: ℝᵐ → ℝⁿ.\\n\\n**Step 2: Remove a point from ℝⁿ**\\nConsider ℝⁿ with the origin 0 removed: ℝⁿ \\\\ {0}. Since f is a homeomorphism, it restricts to a homeomorphism between ℝⁿ \\\\ {0} and ℝᵐ \\\\ {f(0)}. Let p = f(0) ∈ ℝᵐ. Then:\\nℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {p}\\n\\n**Step 3: Use homogeneity of ℝᵐ**\\nThe Euclidean space ℝᵐ is homogeneous: for any two points p, q ∈ ℝᵐ, there exists a homeomorphism h: ℝᵐ → ℝᵐ such that h(p) = q. In particular, there exists a homeomorphism h: ℝᵐ → ℝᵐ with h(p) = 0. Then h restricts to a homeomorphism:\\nℝᵐ \\\\ {p} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {0}\\n\\n**Step 4: Combine homeomorphisms**\\nFrom Steps 2 and 3, we have a chain of homeomorphisms:\\nℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {p} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {0}\\nTherefore:\\nℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {0}\\n\\n**Step 5: Compute homotopy types**\\nFor any k ≥ 1, ℝᵏ \\\\ {0} is homotopy equivalent to the (k-1)-sphere Sᵏ⁻¹. This can be seen via the deformation retraction r: ℝᵏ \\\\ {0} → Sᵏ⁻¹ defined by r(x) = x/‖x‖. The inclusion i: Sᵏ⁻¹ → ℝᵏ \\\\ {0} and the retraction r satisfy r∘i = id_{Sᵏ⁻¹} and i∘r is homotopic to id_{ℝᵏ\\\\{0\\}} via the straight-line homotopy H(x,t) = (1-t)x + t(x/‖x‖).\\n\\nThus:\\nℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≃ Sⁿ⁻¹ (homotopy equivalent to (n-1)-sphere)\\nℝᵐ \\\\ {0} ≃ Sᵐ⁻¹ (homotopy equivalent to (m-1)-sphere)\\n\\n**Step 6: Homotopy equivalence of spheres**\\nSince homeomorphic spaces are homotopy equivalent, and homotopy equivalence is transitive, from ℝⁿ \\\\ {0} ≅ ℝᵐ \\\\ {0} we obtain:\\nSⁿ⁻¹ ≃ Sᵐ⁻¹\\n\\n**Step 7: Compute homology groups**\\nFor spheres, the homology groups are well-known. For the k-sphere Sᵏ:\\nH_i(Sᵏ) = ℤ if i = 0 or i = k\\nH_i(Sᵏ) = 0 otherwise\\n\\nIn particular:\\nH_{n-1}(Sⁿ⁻¹) = ℤ\\nH_{m-1}(Sᵐ⁻¹) = ℤ\\n\\nHowever, homotopy equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups. Since Sⁿ⁻¹ ≃ Sᵐ⁻¹, we must have:\\nH_{n-1}(Sⁿ⁻¹) ≅ H_{n-1}(Sᵐ⁻¹)\\n\\n**Step 8: Derive contradiction when n ≠ m**\\nConsider two cases:\\n\\nCase 1: If n > m, then n-1 > m-1. Then:\\nH_{n-1}(Sⁿ⁻¹) = ℤ\\nH_{n-1}(Sᵐ⁻¹) = 0 (since n-1 > m-1 and n-1 ≠ 0)\\n\\nThis gives ℤ ≅ 0, which is false.\\n\\nCase 2: If n < m, then n-1 < m-1. Then:\\nH_{n-1}(Sⁿ⁻¹) = ℤ if n-1 = 0 (i.e., n=1), or 0 if n-1 > 0\\nH_{n-1}(Sᵐ⁻¹) = 0 (since n-1 < m-1 and n-1 ≠ m-1)\\n\\nIf n=1, then H₀(S⁰) = ℤ⊕ℤ (since S⁰ is two points), not ℤ. Actually, S⁰ is two points, so H₀(S⁰) = ℤ⊕ℤ. For n>1, H_{n-1}(Sⁿ⁻¹) = ℤ but H_{n-1}(Sᵐ⁻¹) = 0. Either way, we get a contradiction.\\n\\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\\nThe contradiction arises from assuming ℝⁿ ≅ ℝᵐ when n ≠ m. Therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence:\\nℝⁿ ≇ ℝᵐ when n ≠ m\\n\\nThis completes the proof that Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic.\"\n}",
