Therefore:\n|x + y| = x + y\nAlso, since x ≥ 0, |x| = x, and since y ≥ 0, |y| = y.\nThus: |x + y| = x + y = |x| + |y|\nSo the inequality holds with equality.\n\n**Case 2: x ≥ 0 and y < 0**\nHere x ≥ 0, so |x| = x, and y < 0, so |y| = -y.\nWe need to consider two subcases based on the sign of x + y:\n\n*Subcase 2a: x + y ≥ 0*\nThen |x + y| = x + y.\nSince y < 0, we have x + y < x = |x|.\nBut |x| ≤ |x| + |y| because |y| = -y > 0.\nThus: |x + y| = x + y < x = |x| ≤ |x| + |y|\n\n*Subcase 2b: x + y < 0*\nThen |x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y.\nSince x ≥ 0, we have -x ≤ 0 ≤ |x|.\nSince y < 0, we have -y = |y|.\nThus: |x + y| = -x - y = -x + (-y) = -x + |y| ≤ |x| + |y|\nbecause -x ≤ |x| and |y| = |y|.\n\n**Case 3: x < 0 and y ≥ 0**\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2 by swapping the roles of x and y. The proof follows exactly the same logic as Case 2, with x and y interchanged.\n\n**Case 4: x < 0 and y < 0**\nSince both x and y are negative, x + y < 0. Therefore:\n|x + y| = -(x + y) = -x - y\nSince x < 0, |x| = -x, and since y < 0, |y| = -y.\nThus: |x + y| = -x - y = |x| + |y|\nSo the inequality holds with equality.\n\nSince these four cases cover all possible sign combinations for real numbers x and y, we have shown that |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| for all real x and y.\n\n**Proof Approach 2: Algebraic Proof**\n\nAn alternative proof uses the fact that for any real number a, |a|² = a².\n\nConsider:\n|x + y|² = (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²\n\nNow, note that xy ≤ |xy| = |x||y|, since for any real numbers a and b, ab ≤ |ab| = |a||b|.\nTherefore:\nx² + 2xy + y² ≤ x² + 2|x||y| + y²\n\nBut x² = |x|² and y² = |y|², so:\n|x + y|² ≤ |x|² + 2|x||y| + |y|² = (|x| + |y|)²\n\nSince both |x + y|² and (|x| + |y|)² are non-negative, we can take square roots (preserving the inequality because the square root function is increasing on non-negative numbers):\n|x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nBoth proof approaches establish the Triangle Inequality for all real numbers x and y.",
