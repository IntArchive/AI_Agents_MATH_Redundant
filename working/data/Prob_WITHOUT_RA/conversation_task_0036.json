A is an n×n matrix (Assumption 1)\n2. B is an n×n matrix (Assumption 2)\n3. There exists a nonsingular matrix S such that S⁻¹AS is a diagonal matrix (Assumption 3)\n4. There exists a nonsingular matrix S such that S⁻¹BS is a diagonal matrix (Assumption 4)\n\nNote: The same matrix S simultaneously diagonalizes both A and B.\n\nProof:\n\nStep 1: Define the diagonal matrices.\nLet D_A = S⁻¹AS and D_B = S⁻¹BS. By assumptions 3 and 4, both D_A and D_B are diagonal matrices.\n\nStep 2: Diagonal matrices commute.\nFor any diagonal matrices D_A = diag(λ₁, λ₂, ..., λ_n) and D_B = diag(μ₁, μ₂, ..., μ_n), their product is:\nD_A D_B = diag(λ₁μ₁, λ₂μ₂, ..., λ_nμ_n)\nD_B D_A = diag(μ₁λ₁, μ₂λ₂, ..., μ_nλ_n)\nSince multiplication of scalars is commutative (λ_iμ_i = μ_iλ_i for all i = 1, 2, ..., n), we have:\nD_A D_B = D_B D_A.\n\nStep 3: Express A and B in terms of S and the diagonal matrices.\nSince D_A = S⁻¹AS, we can solve for A:\nA = S D_A S⁻¹.\nSimilarly, from D_B = S⁻¹BS, we have:\nB = S D_B S⁻¹.\n\nStep 4: Compute the product AB.\nAB = (S D_A S⁻¹)(S D_B S⁻¹)\n   = S D_A (S⁻¹S) D_B S⁻¹  (by associativity of matrix multiplication)\n   = S D_A I D_B S⁻¹       (since S⁻¹S = I, the identity matrix)\n   = S (D_A D_B) S⁻¹      (since I D_B = D_B and D_A D_B = D_A D_B)\n\nStep 5: Compute the product BA.\nBA = (S D_B S⁻¹)(S D_A S⁻¹)\n   = S D_B (S⁻¹S) D_A S⁻¹  (by associativity of matrix multiplication)\n   = S D_B I D_A S⁻¹       (since S⁻¹S = I)\n   = S (D_B D_A) S⁻¹      (since I D_A = D_A and D_B D_A = D_B D_A)\n\nStep 6: Use the commutativity of diagonal matrices.\nFrom Step 2, we have D_A D_B = D_B D_A.\nTherefore:\nS (D_A D_B) S⁻¹ = S (D_B D_A) S⁻¹.\n\nStep 7: Conclude that AB = BA.\nFrom Steps 4 and 5:\nAB = S (D_A D_B) S⁻¹\nBA = S (D_B D_A) S⁻¹\nSince D_A D_B = D_B D_A (Step 6), we have:\nAB = BA.\n\nThus, we have proven that if two matrices A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable by the same nonsingular matrix S, then they commute: AB = BA.\n\nAdditional note: The converse is also true under certain conditions (if A and B are diagonalizable and commute, then they are simultaneously diagonalizable), but that is not required for this proof.",
