    "Content":"Define a function $f(\\alpha, \\beta)$, $\\alpha \\in (-1,1)$, $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$ as $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}$$ One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem to show that $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\pi \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha \\beta\\right )}}{ \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha\\right )} \\,  \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\beta\\right )}} $$ Clearly, from this latter expression, $f(\\alpha, \\beta) = f(\\beta, \\alpha)$.  My question is, can one see this symmetry directly from the integral expression?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants. Surprisingly, $$\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}\\qquad(\\star)$$ which is obviously symmetric. The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane. By residue theorem, $$\\begin{align}\nI &=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot -2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the right half plane} \\\\\n&=-\\frac1y\\left(\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{+})+\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{-})\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)y}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-1}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c+1}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-2}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c}}{y^{2}-1}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\left(e^{\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}-e^{-\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ For $0<y<1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the left half plane. By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ . In conclusion, $$\\frac1{2\\pi i}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\frac{y^{-\\beta-1}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}d\\beta=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}$$ $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n= \\frac2{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}dxdy$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

We will analyze the convergence conditions of the integral f(α, β).\n\nLet I = f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nFor I to converge, we need to examine two regions: near x = 0 and as x → ∞.\n\n1. Behavior near x = 0:\n   As x → 0⁺, the integrand behaves like:\n   x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) ∼ x^α\/(1) = x^α.\n   For convergence at the lower limit (x = 0), we need ∫₀^ε x^α dx to converge for some ε > 0.\n   This requires α > -1. This condition is given as part of our assumption (α ∈ (-1, 1)), so it's satisfied.\n\n2. Behavior as x → ∞:\n   As x → ∞, the integrand behaves like:\n   x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) ∼ x^α\/x² = x^{α-2}.\n   For convergence at the upper limit, we need ∫_M^∞ x^{α-2} dx to converge for some M > 0.\n   This requires α - 2 < -1, i.e., α < 1. This condition is also given (α ∈ (-1, 1)), so it's satisfied.\n\n3. Behavior at finite positive x:\n   The denominator D(x) = 1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² must not vanish for any x ≥ 0, otherwise the integrand would have a pole on the path of integration, causing divergence.\n   \n   Analyze D(x):\n   D(x) = 1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² = (x + cos(πβ))² + 1 - cos²(πβ) = (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ).\n   \n   For x ≥ 0, D(x) = 0 if and only if:\n   (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ) = 0.\n   Since both terms are non-negative, this requires:\n   (x + cos(πβ))² = 0 AND sin²(πβ) = 0.\n   \n   The first condition gives x = -cos(πβ).\n   The second condition gives sin(πβ) = 0, i.e., πβ = kπ for some integer k, or β = k.\n   \n   For x = -cos(πβ) to be ≥ 0, we need -cos(πβ) ≥ 0, i.e., cos(πβ) ≤ 0.\n   \n   Combining conditions:\n   - β = k (integer)\n   - cos(πβ) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k ≤ 0\n   \n   This means (-1)^k ≤ 0, which occurs when k is odd (since (-1)^k = -1 for odd k).\n   \n   Therefore, D(x) = 0 for some x ≥ 0 if and only if β is an odd integer.\n   \n   However, we need a stronger condition. Let's examine what happens when |β| ≥ 1.\n   \n   Case 1: β ≥ 1\n   - If β = 1, then πβ = π, cos(π) = -1, sin(π) = 0.\n     Then D(x) = 1 - 2x + x² = (x - 1)².\n     At x = 1, D(1) = 0, so the integrand has a pole at x = 1, causing divergence.\n   - If β > 1, say β = 1 + δ with δ > 0, then πβ = π + πδ.\n     cos(πβ) = cos(π + πδ) = -cos(πδ).\n     sin(πβ) = sin(π + πδ) = -sin(πδ).\n     For small δ > 0, cos(πδ) ≈ 1, sin(πδ) ≈ πδ.\n     Then D(x) = 1 - 2x cos(πδ) + x² ≈ 1 - 2x + x² = (x - 1)² for small δ.\n     The minimum occurs near x = 1, with value approximately sin²(πδ) ≈ (πδ)² > 0.\n     So technically D(x) > 0 for all x ≥ 0 when β > 1 (not an integer).\n     \n   Case 2: β ≤ -1\n   - If β = -1, then πβ = -π, cos(-π) = -1, sin(-π) = 0.\n     Same as β = 1 case: pole at x = 1.\n   - If β < -1, similar analysis shows D(x) > 0 for all x ≥ 0.\n   \n   However, there's another crucial consideration. The integral f(α, β) is likely part of a symmetric relationship. Consider the symmetric expression:\n   f(β, α) = ∫₀^∞ x^β\/(1 + 2x cos(πα) + x²) dx.\n   \n   For f(β, α) to be defined (if we want to discuss it or prove f(α, β) = f(β, α)), we need the same convergence conditions applied to β:\n   - Near x = 0: need β > -1\n   - As x → ∞: need β < 1\n   \n   Therefore, for f(β, α) to converge, we need β ∈ (-1, 1).\n   \n   Since the problem context (though not explicitly stated) typically involves proving symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α), and since f(α, β) is given as defined with α ∈ (-1, 1), for the symmetry to make sense, f(β, α) must also be defined, which requires β ∈ (-1, 1).\n   \n   Moreover, even without assuming symmetry, if we require the integral f(α, β) to be well-behaved (analytic in parameters), we typically want the denominator to be positive for all x ≥ 0. The condition |β| < 1 ensures that:\n   - When cos(πβ) < 0, we have sin²(πβ) > 0 (since |β| < 1 ⇒ π|β| < π ⇒ πβ is not an integer multiple of π)\n   - Thus D(x) = (x + cos(πβ))² + sin²(πβ) ≥ sin²(πβ) > 0 for all x ≥ 0.\n   \n   In contrast, if |β| ≥ 1, then either:\n   - β = ±1 gives D(1) = 0 (pole at x = 1)\n   - |β| > 1 gives D(x) > 0 but the parameter β is outside the natural domain where the integral representation is typically considered.\n   \n   Therefore, from the convergence requirements and the natural domain of such integral representations, we conclude that β must satisfy β ∈ (-1, 1).\n\nThus, given α ∈ (-1, 1) and f(α, β) defined, we have proven that β ∈ (-1, 1).",
