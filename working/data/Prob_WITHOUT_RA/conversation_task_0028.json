The characteristic polynomial of A is defined as p(λ) = det(λI - A), where I is the n×n identity matrix.\\n\\nSince the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors by assumption, we can factor it completely over the field (typically the complex numbers if we consider algebraic closure). Write the factorization as:\\n\\np(λ) = (λ - λ₁)^{m₁}(λ - λ₂)^{m₂}⋯(λ - λ_k)^{m_k}\\n\\nwhere λ₁, λ₂, ..., λ_k are the distinct eigenvalues of A, and m₁, m₂, ..., m_k are positive integers.\\n\\nNow, we need to verify several key points:\\n\\n1. The λ_i are indeed eigenvalues of A: For each λ_i, since (λ_i - λ_i)^{m_i} = 0 in the factorization, we have p(λ_i) = det(λ_iI - A) = 0. This means λ_iI - A is singular, so λ_i is an eigenvalue of A.\\n\\n2. The m_i are the algebraic multiplicities: By definition, the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue λ_i is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial. In the factorization p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)^{m₁}(λ - λ₂)^{m₂}⋯(λ - λ_k)^{m_k}, the exponent m_i indicates that λ_i appears as a root exactly m_i times.

The sum of algebraic multiplicities equals n: The characteristic polynomial p(λ) = det(λI - A) is a monic polynomial of degree n (since A is n×n). When expanded, the factored form (λ - λ₁)^{m₁}(λ - λ₂)^{m₂}⋯(λ - λ_k)^{m_k} has degree m₁ + m₂ + ⋯ + m_k. Equating degrees, we have:\\n\\nm₁ + m₂ + ⋯ + m_k = n\\n\\nThis shows that the total count of eigenvalues (with multiplicities) equals the dimension of the matrix.\\n\\n4.
