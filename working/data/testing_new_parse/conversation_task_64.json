Then $L_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$. We need to show $L_{n+1} < L_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Reformulating the decreasing condition**\n$L_{n+1} < L_n$ means:\n$a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} < a_{n+1} - a_n$\nRearranging:\n$a_{n+2} + a_n < 2a_{n+1}$\n\n**Step 3: Using the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means**\nBy the AM-GM inequality:\n$\\frac{a_{n+2} + a_n}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{a_{n+2}a_n}$\nThus, if we can prove the stronger inequality:\n$\\sqrt{a_{n+2}a_n} < a_{n+1}$\nthen it follows that $a_{n+2} + a_n < 2a_{n+1}$.\n\n**Step 4: Squaring both sides**\nThe inequality $\\sqrt{a_{n+2}a_n} < a_{n+1}$ is equivalent to:\n$a_{n+2}a_n < a_{n+1}^2$\n\n**Step 5: Substituting the definitions**\nSubstituting $a_n = (n!)^{1/n}$, $a_{n+1} = ((n+1)!)^{1/(n+1)}$, and $a_{n+2} = ((n+2)!)^{1/(n+2)}$:\n$((n+2)!)^{1/(n+2)} \\cdot (n!)^{1/n} < ((n+1)!)^{2/(n+1)}$\n\n**Step 6: Eliminating fractional exponents**\nRaise both sides to the power $n(n+1)(n+2)$ to obtain integer exponents:\n$[((n+2)!)^{1/(n+2)}]^{n(n+1)(n+2)} \\cdot [(n!)^{1/n}]^{n(n+1)(n+2)} < [((n+1)!)^{2/(n+1)}]^{n(n+1)(n+2)}$\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n$((n+2)!)^{n(n+1)} \\cdot (n!)^{(n+1)(n+2)} < ((n+1)!)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 7: Expressing in terms of factorials**\nRecall that $(n+2)! = (n+2)(n+1)n!$ and $(n+1)! = (n+1)n!$. Substituting:\n$[(n+2)(n+1)n!]^{n(n+1)} \\cdot (n!)^{(n+1)(n+2)} < [(n+1)n!]^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 8: Simplifying the inequality**\nThis becomes:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{n(n+1)} \\cdot (n!)^{(n+1)(n+2)} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\nCombining powers of $n!$ on the left:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{n(n+1)+(n+1)(n+2)} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 9: Comparing exponents**\nFirst, compare the exponents of $n!$:\nLeft side exponent: $n(n+1)+(n+1)(n+2) = (n+1)(n+n+2) = (n+1)(2n+2) = 2(n+1)^2$\nRight side exponent: $2n(n+2) = 2n^2 + 4n$\n\nSince $2(n+1)^2 = 2n^2 + 4n + 2 > 2n^2 + 4n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the left side has a larger exponent for $n!$.\n\n**Step 10: Canceling common factors**\nWe can cancel $(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$ from both sides (since $n! > 0$):\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{2} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 11: Further simplification**\nDivide both sides by $(n+1)^{n(n+1)}$:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{2} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)-n(n+1)} = (n+1)^{n(n+3)}$\n\n**Step 12: Taking nth roots**\nTake the $n$th root of both sides:\n$(n+2)^{n+1}(n!)^{2/n} < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\n**Step 13: Final inequality to prove**\nWe need to show:\n$(n+2)^{n+1}(n!)^{2/n} < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\n**Step 14: Using known inequality for $(n!)^{1/n}$**\nWe know that $(n!)^{1/n} < \\frac{n+1}{2}$ for $n \\geq 1$ (this can be proven by AM-GM: $(n!)^{1/n} < \\frac{1+2+\\cdots+n}{n} = \\frac{n+1}{2}$).\n\nThus $(n!)^{2/n} < \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2$.\n\n**Step 15: Substituting the bound**\nIt suffices to prove:\n$(n+2)^{n+1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2 < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\nDividing both sides by $(n+1)^{n+1}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{(n+1)^2}{4} < (n+1)^2$\n\n**Step 16: Simplifying**\nCancel $(n+1)^2$ from both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} < 1$\n\n**Step 17: Final inequality**\nWe need to show:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} < 4$\n\n**Step 18: Proving the final inequality**\nNote that $\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1}$.\n\nIt is well-known that $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m < e < 3 < 4$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This can be proven without calculus using binomial expansion and comparison with geometric series.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, which completes the proof that $L_n$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n**Conclusion:** We have shown that $L_{n+1} < L_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proving that the sequence $L_n = \\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n]{n!}$ is strictly decreasing.",
