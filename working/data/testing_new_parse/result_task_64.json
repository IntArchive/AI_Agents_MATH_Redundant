    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem. The user wants to structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should list each condition applied to one object.\n\nLooking at the original problem: \"Prove elementarily that √[n+1] {(n+1)!} - √[n] {n!} is strictly decreasing.\" The title and question both mention proving the sequence L_n is strictly decreasing for natural numbers n. \n\nFirst, identify the assumptions. The problem states \"n ∈ ℕ\", so n is a natural number. The sequence L_n is defined as the difference between two roots: the (n+1)th root of (n+1)! and the nth root of n!. The task is to show this difference is strictly decreasing. \n\nWait, the example included an assumption about divisibility by 7, but here, the only explicit condition is that n is a natural number. However, sometimes problems might have implicit assumptions. Let me check if there's any more. The problem specifies \"without calculus,\" so maybe there's an assumption that the proof should use elementary methods. But in the example, the assumption was part of the problem's conditions, not the method. The user's instruction says to list assumptions that are part of the problem's conditions, not the method of proof. So the method (without calculus) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. \n\nTherefore, the assumptions here are:\n- n is a natural number (n ∈ ℕ)\n- The sequence L_n is defined as the difference between the (n+1)th root of (n+1)! and the nth root of n!.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumptions were listed as each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. So for the problem here, the main assumption is that n is a natural number. The definition of L_n is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So perhaps the only assumption is that n is in ℕ. Let me check the example again. In the example, the original problem had \"for every integer n\" and the formatted problem listed \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, the original problem had \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem split into two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the problem statement in the formatted version added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the example? Let me recheck. The original problem said \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem's assumptions were \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" But that seems contradictory because the original problem states for every integer n, but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Maybe the example was incorrect, or perhaps the user made a mistake. Hmm, this could be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was edited, and the formatted version added an extra condition. But in any case, according to the user's instructions, the task is to list all the assumptions of the problem. \n\nIn the current problem, the user wrote: \"Prove without calculus that the sequence L_n = ... is strictly decreasing for n ∈ ℕ.\" So the assumptions here are that n is a natural number, and the problem is to prove L_n is strictly decreasing. The method (without calculus) is part of the problem statement, not an assumption. So the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the sequence $$L_{n}=\\sqrt[n+1] {(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n] {n!}$$ is strictly decreasing.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title mentions \"elementarily\", and the question says \"without calculus\", but according to the user's example, the method (like \"without calculus\") is part of the problem statement. So in the problem line, it should say \"Prove without calculus that...\".\n\nWait, the example given by the user included in the problem line \"Prove that...\", but the original problem had \"for every integer n\", and the formatted problem's assumptions included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. So maybe in that example, the user added an extra assumption that wasn't in the original problem? Because the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake, but perhaps it's intentional. So maybe the user wants to split the original problem's conditions into separate assumptions. \n\nBut in the current problem, the only condition given is that n is a natural number. So the assumption is n ∈ ℕ. The problem is to prove that L_n is strictly decreasing, and the method is \"without calculus\", which is part of the problem statement. So the formatted problem should include the method in the problem line.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve without calculus that the sequence $$L_{n}=\\sqrt[n+1] {(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n] {n!}$$ is strictly decreasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"without calculus\" is considered an assumption. Wait, in the example, the original problem didn't have the divisibility by 7, but the formatted problem added it as an assumption. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to capture all the conditions, including any hidden ones. But in the problem here, the only explicit assumption is that n is a natural number. The requirement to prove it without calculus is part of the problem's instruction, not an assumption on the variables or the sequence. So the formatted problem should include the \"without calculus\" in the problem statement, not as an assumption. Therefore, the correct format would be:\n\nAssumption:\nn is a natural number.\n\nProblem:\nProve without calculus that the sequence $$L_{n}=\\sqrt[n+1] {(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n] {n!}$$ is strictly decreasing.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because the assumptions are about the problem's conditions (n is natural), and the problem includes the method constraint. So the answer should be structured as such.",

We need to show $L_n = a_{n+1} - a_n$ is strictly decreasing, i.e., $a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} < a_{n+1} - a_n$, or equivalently $a_{n+2} + a_n < 2a_{n+1}$.\n\nFirst, note that $a_n$ is strictly increasing: $(n!)^{1\/n} < ((n+1)!)^{1\/(n+1)}$ since raising to power $n(n+1)$ gives $(n!)^{n+1} < ((n+1)!)^n = (n!)^n \\cdot (n+1)^n$, which simplifies to $n! < (n+1)^n$, true because $1\\cdot2\\cdots n < (n+1)\\cdots(n+1)$.\n\nNow consider the inequality $a_{n+2} + a_n < 2a_{n+1}$.

Substituting:\n$[(n+2)(n+1)n!]^{n(n+1)} \\cdot (n!)^{(n+1)(n+2)} < [(n+1)n!]^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 8: Simplifying the inequality**\nThis becomes:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{n(n+1)} \\cdot (n!)^{(n+1)(n+2)} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\nCombining powers of $n!$ on the left:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{n(n+1)+(n+1)(n+2)} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 9: Comparing exponents**\nFirst, compare the exponents of $n!$:\nLeft side exponent: $n(n+1)+(n+1)(n+2) = (n+1)(n+n+2) = (n+1)(2n+2) = 2(n+1)^2$\nRight side exponent: $2n(n+2) = 2n^2 + 4n$\n\nSince $2(n+1)^2 = 2n^2 + 4n + 2 > 2n^2 + 4n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the left side has a larger exponent for $n!$.\n\n**Step 10: Canceling common factors**\nWe can cancel $(n!)^{2n(n+2)}$ from both sides (since $n! > 0$):\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n+1)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{2} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)}$\n\n**Step 11: Further simplification**\nDivide both sides by $(n+1)^{n(n+1)}$:\n$(n+2)^{n(n+1)}(n!)^{2} < (n+1)^{2n(n+2)-n(n+1)} = (n+1)^{n(n+3)}$\n\n**Step 12: Taking nth roots**\nTake the $n$th root of both sides:\n$(n+2)^{n+1}(n!)^{2\/n} < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\n**Step 13: Final inequality to prove**\nWe need to show:\n$(n+2)^{n+1}(n!)^{2\/n} < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\n**Step 14: Using known inequality for $(n!)^{1\/n}$**\nWe know that $(n!)^{1\/n} < \\frac{n+1}{2}$ for $n \\geq 1$ (this can be proven by AM-GM: $(n!)^{1\/n} < \\frac{1+2+\\cdots+n}{n} = \\frac{n+1}{2}$).\n\nThus $(n!)^{2\/n} < \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2$.\n\n**Step 15: Substituting the bound**\nIt suffices to prove:\n$(n+2)^{n+1} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2 < (n+1)^{n+3}$\n\nDividing both sides by $(n+1)^{n+1}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{(n+1)^2}{4} < (n+1)^2$\n\n**Step 16: Simplifying**\nCancel $(n+1)^2$ from both sides:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} < 1$\n\n**Step 17: Final inequality**\nWe need to show:\n$\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} < 4$\n\n**Step 18: Proving the final inequality**\nNote that $\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1}$.\n\nIt is well-known that $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^m < e < 3 < 4$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This can be proven without calculus using binomial expansion and comparison with geometric series.\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, which completes the proof that $L_n$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n**Conclusion:** We have shown that $L_{n+1} < L_n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, proving that the sequence $L_n = \\sqrt[n+1]{(n+1)!} - \\sqrt[n]{n!}$ is strictly decreasing.",
