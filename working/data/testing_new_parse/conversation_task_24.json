Since π is transcendental (Assumption 1), π is not an algebraic number. In particular, π is not an integer.\n\n2. Let A = π^(π^π). Then y = π^A.\n\n3. For y to be an integer, we would need either:\n   - π is an integer and A is a non-negative integer, OR\n   - π is a rational number raised to an appropriate power to yield an integer\n\n4. However, π is transcendental, so it cannot be an integer (integers are algebraic numbers of degree 1).\n\n5. Could π be a rational number? No, because rational numbers are algebraic (they satisfy linear equations with integer coefficients), and π is transcendental.\n\n6. The only other possibility for π^A to be an integer would be if π were an algebraic number that is a root of an integer. But π is transcendental, so this is impossible.\n\n7. More formally: If π^A were an integer N, then π would be an A-th root of N. This would make π algebraic (satisfying x^A - N = 0), contradicting the transcendence of π.\n\n8.
