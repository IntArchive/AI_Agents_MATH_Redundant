Therefore:\n   Area(△OAB) ≤ Area(sector OAB) ≤ Area(△OAC)\n\n3. **Area Calculations:**\n   - **Triangle OAB:** This is a triangle with base OA = 1 and height = sin x (the y-coordinate of B).\n     Area(△OAB) = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × sin x = (1/2)sin x\n\n   - **Sector OAB:** For a unit circle, the area of a sector with central angle x (in radians) is:\n     Area(sector OAB) = (1/2) × radius² × angle = (1/2) × 1² × x = (1/2)x\n\n   - **Triangle OAC:** This is a right triangle with:\n     * Base OA = 1 (along x-axis)\n     * Height AC = tan x (since in right triangle OAC, tan x = opposite/adjacent = AC/OA = AC/1)\n     Area(△OAC) = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × tan x = (1/2)tan x\n\n4. **Inequality Derivation:**\n   From the area containment: (1/2)sin x ≤ (1/2)x ≤ (1/2)tan x\n   Multiplying by 2: sin x ≤ x ≤ tan x for x > 0\n   Rearranging: (1/2)tan x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin x for x > 0\n\n**Case 2: x < 0 (small negative angle)**\n\n1. **Symmetry Properties:**\n   - sin(-x) = -sin x\n   - tan(-x) = -tan x\n   - For x < 0, let y = -x > 0\n\n2. **Applying the Positive Case:**\n   From Case 1 with y > 0: (1/2)tan y ≥ (1/2)y ≥ (1/2)sin y\n\n3. **Substituting y = -x:**\n   (1/2)tan(-x) ≥ (1/2)(-x) ≥ (1/2)sin(-x)\n   Using symmetry: (1/2)(-tan x) ≥ (1/2)(-x) ≥ (1/2)(-sin x)\n\n4. **Multiplying by -1 (reverses inequalities):**\n   (1/2)tan x ≤ (1/2)x ≤ (1/2)sin x\n   Rearranging: (1/2)sin x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)tan x\n   Which is equivalent to: (1/2)tan x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin x (same as original)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor x approaching 0 (both positive and negative), we have shown that:\n(1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x)\n\nThis completes the geometric proof without using Taylor series expansions, relying only on basic trigonometry and area comparisons on the unit circle.",
