Each row rᵢ = [aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ, dᵢ, eᵢ] forms a 5-digit number Nᵢ = 10000aᵢ + 1000bᵢ + 100cᵢ + 10dᵢ + eᵢ that is divisible by 19 by assumption. Thus for each i:\n10000aᵢ + 1000bᵢ + 100cᵢ + 10dᵢ + eᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 19)\n\nDefine the vector v = [10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1] modulo 19. Then for each row rᵢ:\nv·rᵢᵀ = 10000aᵢ + 1000bᵢ + 100cᵢ + 10dᵢ + eᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 19)\n\nThus v is a non-zero vector (since its entries are not all 0 modulo 19) in the left nullspace of M modulo 19. This means M is singular modulo 19, i.e., det(M) ≡ 0 (mod 19). Therefore, 19 divides det(M).\n\nVerification: We can check that v = [10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1] ≡ [5, 12, 5, 10, 1] (mod 19) since 10000 ≡ 5, 1000 ≡ 12, 100 ≡ 5 (mod 19). For each row, the dot product with v modulo 19 equals the 5-digit number modulo 19, which is 0 by assumption.\n",

Working modulo 19, we compute:\n\nv·rᵢᵀ = 10000aᵢ + 1000bᵢ + 100cᵢ + 10dᵢ + eᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 19) for each i = 1,...,5.\n\nThis means that vM ≡ 0 (mod 19) when considered as a row vector multiplying the matrix M. In other words, v is a non-zero vector in the left nullspace of M modulo 19.\n\nSince v ≠ 0 (mod 19) (as 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1 are not all divisible by 19), this shows that M has a non-trivial left nullspace when considered as a matrix over the field ℤ/19ℤ. A matrix over a field has a non-trivial left nullspace if and only if it is singular (i.e., has determinant 0).\n\nTherefore, det(M) ≡ 0 (mod 19) when considered modulo 19. Since det(M) is an integer, this means 19 divides det(M).\n\nMore formally:\n1. Let M be the 5×5 integer matrix with rows r₁,...,r₅.\n2. Define v = [10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1].\n3. For each i, v·rᵢᵀ = 10000aᵢ + 1000bᵢ + 100cᵢ + 10dᵢ + eᵢ ≡ 0 (mod 19) by hypothesis.\n4. Thus vM ≡ 0 (mod 19) as a row vector.\n5. Since v ≠ 0 (mod 19), M has a non-trivial left nullspace over ℤ/19ℤ.\n6. A matrix over a field is singular if and only if it has a non-trivial left nullspace.\n7. Therefore, M is singular modulo 19, so det(M) ≡ 0 (mod 19).\n8. Hence 19 divides the integer det(M).\n\nThis completes the proof.",
