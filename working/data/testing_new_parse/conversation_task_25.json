We need to prove that f(x) must have the specific form involving logarithmic derivatives and a derivative term.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem setup**\n\nLet f(x) = x^x = e^{x ln x}. This is a transcendental function involving both exponential and logarithmic components. The problem states that F(x) is an elementary function such that F'(x) = f(x). By definition, an elementary function is one that can be expressed using a finite combination of algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and compositions of algebraic functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions (and their inverses).\n\n**Step 2: Applying Liouville's theorem on elementary integrals**\n\nLiouville's theorem on elementary integrals (also known as Liouville's theorem on integration in finite terms) provides necessary conditions for when an integral can be expressed in elementary form. The theorem states:\n\n*If ∫g(x)dx is an elementary function, then g(x) must be expressible in the form:*\n\ng(x) = ∑_{i=1}^n c_i * (u_i'(x)/u_i(x)) + v'(x)\n\n*where:*\n- c_i are constants (complex numbers)\n- u_i(x) are algebraic functions\n- v(x) is an algebraic function\n\nThis is a fundamental result in differential algebra that characterizes the structure of functions that have elementary antiderivatives.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the theorem to our specific function**\n\nIn our case, we have:\n- g(x) = f(x) = x^x\n- The assumption states that ∫f(x)dx = F(x) is elementary\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, since ∫f(x)dx is elementary, f(x) must satisfy the form:\n\nf(x) = ∑_{i=1}^n c_i * (u_i'(x)/u_i(x)) + v'(x)\n\nfor some integer n ≥ 0, constants c_i, and algebraic functions u_i(x) and v(x).\n\n**Step 4: Making the notation consistent with the problem statement**\n\nThe problem statement uses slightly different notation:\n- Instead of g(x), it uses a\n- Instead of x, it uses t as the variable\n- Instead of u_i(x), it uses U_i(t)\n- Instead of v(x), it uses V(t)\n\nMaking these substitutions, we get:\n\na = ∑_{i=1}^n c_i * (U_i'(t)/U_i(t)) + V'(t)\n\nwhere a = f(t) = t^t.\n\n**Step 5: Completing the proof**\n\nThe proof is now complete:\n\n1. We started with f(x) = x^x and the assumption that its antiderivative F(x) is elementary.\n2. By Liouville's theorem on elementary integrals, if ∫g(x)dx is elementary, then g(x) must have the form ∑_{i=1}^n c_i(u_i'(x)/u_i(x)) + v'(x).\n3. Applying this theorem to our function f(x) with the given assumption, we conclude that f(x) must have exactly this form.\n4. Changing notation to match the problem statement gives: a = c₁(U₁'(t)/U₁(t)) + c₂(U₂'(t)/U₂(t)) + ... + cₙ(Uₙ'(t)/Uₙ(t)) + V'(t), where a = f(t).\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n1. This proof shows the *necessary condition* that f(x) must satisfy if its antiderivative is elementary. It does not prove that such an antiderivative actually exists.\n2. The constants c_i and the algebraic functions U_i(t) and V(t) are not specified explicitly - the theorem only guarantees their existence.\n3. The value of n (the number of terms) is not determined by the theorem - it could be any non-negative integer.\n4. This result is a direct consequence of Liouville's theorem and does not require any additional analysis of the specific function x^x beyond recognizing it as a transcendental function.\n\nThus, we have proven that if the antiderivative of f(x) = x^x is elementary, then f(x) must be expressible in the stated form involving logarithmic derivatives and a derivative term.",
