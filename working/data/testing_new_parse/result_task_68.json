    "Content":"I stumbled across the following problem and found it cute. Problem: We are given that $19$ divides $23028$, $31882$, $86469$, $6327$, and $61902$. Show that $19$ divides the following determinant: $$\\left|\n \\begin{matrix}\n  2 & 3&0&2&8 \\\\\n  3 & 1&8&8&2\\\\\n8&6&4&6&9\\\\\n0&6&3&2&7\\\\\n6&1&9&0&2\n \\end{matrix}\\right|$$",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Multiply the first column by $10^4$, the second by $10^3$, third by $10^2$ and fourth by $10$ - this will scale the value of the determinant by $10^{4+3+2+1}=10^{10}$, which is coprime to $19$. Now add the last four columns to the first one - this will not change the value of the determinant. Finally notice the first column now reads $23028, 31882, 86469, 6327$, and $61902$: each is a multiple of $19$ so we can factor a nineteen cleanly out the determinant.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this determinant problem. The user wants to show that 19 divides the given 5x5 determinant. The problem mentions that 19 divides several numbers: 23028, 31882, 86469, 6327, and 61902. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me check the rows of the matrix:\n\nFirst row: 2, 3, 0, 2, 8 → which is 23028. Yep, that's the first number given. Second row: 3, 1, 8, 8, 2 → 31882. Third row: 8,6,4,6,9 → 86469. Fourth row: 0,6,3,2,7 → 06327, which is 6327. Fifth row: 6,1,9,0,2 → 61902. So each row of the matrix corresponds to one of these numbers that's divisible by 19.\n\nSo the key point here is that each row, when concatenated into a number, is divisible by 19. The determinant's divisibility by 19 needs to be shown. Now, determinants have properties related to linear combinations of rows. Since each row is a multiple of 19, maybe there's a way to factor out 19 from each row? Wait, but each row as a number is divisible by 19, but how does that translate to the entries in the row?\n\nWait, actually, the number formed by the digits in each row is divisible by 19. But each entry in the row is a single digit. For example, the first row is 2,3,0,2,8. The number 23028 is divisible by 19, but how does that affect the determinant? Maybe there's a relation between the rows and the divisibility by 19. Let me think.\n\nIf each row, when considered as a 5-digit number (with leading zero for the fourth row: 06327), is divisible by 19, perhaps there's a linear combination of the columns that results in each row being a multiple of 19. Alternatively, maybe the determinant can be related to the numbers themselves modulo 19.\n\nAnother approach: determinants are linear in each row. If we can express each row as a multiple of 19 in some vector space sense, then the determinant would be a multiple of 19. But each row as a vector is not necessarily a scalar multiple of 19; rather, the number formed by concatenating the digits is a multiple of 19. So how can this be connected?\n\nWait, maybe consider the rows as vectors multiplied by a certain vector. For example, if we take the digits of the number as coefficients multiplied by powers of 10. For example, 23028 = 2*10^4 + 3*10^3 + 0*10^2 + 2*10 + 8. Since 23028 is divisible by 19, then 2*10^4 + 3*10^3 + 0*10^2 + 2*10 + 8 ≡ 0 mod 19. Similarly for the other rows.\n\nSo, if we let v = [10^4, 10^3, 10^2, 10, 1]^T, then each row vector multiplied by v gives 0 modulo 19. That is, for each row vector r_i, r_i ⋅ v ≡ 0 mod 19. Therefore, the vectors r_i are orthogonal to v modulo 19. If all rows are orthogonal to v, then the determinant might have some relation. But how does that affect the determinant?\n\nAlternatively, if all the row vectors lie in a hyperplane (since they're all orthogonal to v), then the determinant, which is the volume spanned by the rows, would be zero if the hyperplane is of lower dimension. But here, modulo 19, the determinant might be zero modulo 19. Wait, if the rows are linearly dependent modulo 19, then the determinant is congruent to 0 modulo 19. So maybe that's the key.\n\nIf we can show that the rows are linearly dependent over the field Z\/19Z, then the determinant would be zero modulo 19, hence divisible by 19. To show linear dependence, we need some non-trivial combination of the rows (with coefficients in Z\/19Z) that gives zero. But we know that each row r_i satisfies r_i ⋅ v ≡ 0 mod 19, where v is the vector [10^4, 10^3, 10^3, 10, 1]. So, all rows lie in the orthogonal complement of v in (Z\/19Z)^5. The orthogonal complement of a non-zero vector in a 5-dimensional space is a 4-dimensional subspace. Therefore, 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional subspace must be linearly dependent. Hence, the determinant is zero modulo 19.\n\nTherefore, the determinant is divisible by 19. That seems like the right approach. So the key assumptions are that each row, when concatenated into a number, is divisible by 19, which translates to each row being orthogonal to the vector v modulo 19. Then, since there are 5 rows in a 4-dimensional space, they are linearly dependent, so determinant is zero modulo 19. Therefore, 19 divides the determinant.",

A matrix over a field has a non-trivial left nullspace if and only if it is singular (i.e., has determinant 0).\n\nTherefore, det(M) ≡ 0 (mod 19) when considered modulo 19. Since det(M) is an integer, this means 19 divides det(M).\n\nMore formally:\n1. Let M be the 5×5 integer matrix with rows r₁,...,r₅.\n2. Define v = [10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1].\n3.
