    "Content":"I heard that using some relatively basic differential geometry, you can show that the only spheres which are Lie groups are $S^0$, $S^1$, and $S^3$.  My friend who told me this thought that it involved de Rham cohomology, but I don't really know anything about the cohomology of Lie groups so this doesn't help me much.  Presumably there are some pretty strict conditions we can get from talking about invariant differential forms -- if you can tell me anything about this it will be a much-appreciated bonus :) (A necessary condition for a manifold to be a Lie group is that is must be parallelizable, since any Lie group is parallelized (?) by the left-invariant vector fields generated by a basis of the Lie algebra.  Which happens to mean, by some pretty fancy tricks, that the only spheres that even have a chance are the ones listed above plus $S^7$.  The usual parallelization of this last one comes from viewing it as the set of unit octonions, which don't form a group since their multiplication isn't associative; of course this doesn't immediately preclude $S^7$ from admitting the structure of a Lie group.  Whatever.  I'd like to avoid having to appeal to this whole parallelizability business, if possible.)",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Here is the sketch of the proof. Start with a compact connected Lie group G.  Let's break into 2 cases - either $G$ is abelian or not. If $G$ is abelian, then one can easily show the Lie algebra is abelian, i.e., $[x,y]=0$ for any $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathfrak{g}$ .  Since $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is simply connected and has the same Lie algebra as $G$ , it must be the universal cover of $G$ . So, if $G$ is a sphere, it's $S^1$ , since all the others are simply connected, and hence are their own universal covers. Next, we move onto the case where $G$ is nonabelian.  For $x,y,$ and $z$ in the Lie algebra, consider the map $t(x,y,z) = \\langle [x,y], z\\rangle$ .  This map is clearly multilinear.  It obviously changes sign if we swap $x$ and $y$ .  What's a bit more surprising is that it changes sign if we swap $y$ and $z$ or $x$ and $z$ .  Said another way, $t$ is a 3 form!  I believe $t$ is called the Cartan 3-form.  Since $G$ is nonabelian, there are some $x$ and $y$ with $[x,y]\\neq 0$ .  Then $t(x,y,[x,y]) = ||[x,y]||^2 \\neq 0$ so $t$ is not the 0 form. Next, use left translation on $G$ to move $t$ around: define $t$ at the point $g\\in G$ to be $L_{g^{-1}}^*t$ , where $L_{g^{-1}}:G\\rightarrow G$ is given by $L_{g^{-1}}(h) = g^{-1}h$ . This differential 3-form is automatically left invariant from the way you've defined it everywhere.  It takes a bit more work (but is not too hard) to show that it's also right invariant as well. Next one argues that a biinvariant form is automatically closed.  This means $t$ defines an element in the 3rd de Rham cohomology of $G$ .  It must be nonzero, for if $ds = t$ , then we may assume wlog that $s$ is biinvariant in which case $ds = 0 = t$ , but $t$ is not $0$ as we argued above. Thus, for a nonabelian Lie group, $H^3_{\\text{de Rham}}(G)\\neq 0$ .  But this is isomorphic to singular homology.  Hence, for a sphere to have a nonabelian Lie group structure, it must satisfy $H^3(S^n)\\neq 0$ .  This tells you $n=3$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants to show which spheres can be Lie groups, and the answer mentioned is S⁰, S¹, and S³. The question references using differential geometry, possibly de Rham cohomology, and mentions parallelizability.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Lie group is. A Lie group is a group that's also a smooth manifold, where the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth maps. So the sphere in question must have a compatible group structure.\n\nThe user's friend mentioned that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³. S⁰ is the 0-sphere, which consists of two points. That can be considered as the discrete group of order 2. S¹ is the circle group, which is obviously a Lie group under complex multiplication. S³ is the 3-sphere, which can be thought of as the group of unit quaternions. Quaternions are associative, so that works. The 7-sphere, S⁷, corresponds to the octonions, but their multiplication isn't associative, so they don't form a group, hence S⁷ isn't a Lie group. That's probably why it's excluded, even though it's parallelizable.\n\nThe user also mentions parallelizability. A manifold is parallelizable if its tangent bundle is trivial. Lie groups are parallelizable because you can take a basis of the Lie algebra (tangent space at the identity) and left-translate it to every point, giving a global frame. So any sphere that is a Lie group must be parallelizable. \n\nBut not all spheres are parallelizable. In fact, the only parallelizable spheres are S¹, S³, and S⁷, due to results in algebraic topology related to the Bott periodicity theorem. However, even though S⁷ is parallelizable, it can't be made into a Lie group because of the lack of associativity in octonion multiplication. So the next step is to eliminate S⁷. \n\nBut how do we connect this to the problem at hand without diving too deep into cohomology? The user wants to avoid the parallelizability argument if possible. Maybe there's another approach using properties of Lie groups. For example, the cohomology of Lie groups has certain structures. For compact connected Lie groups, the cohomology ring is a Hopf algebra, which might impose restrictions. Alternatively, using the fact that the third cohomology group of a compact Lie group is non-trivial (related to the existence of a non-trivial 3-form from the Lie algebra), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the classification of simple Lie groups. The spheres in question are all low-dimensional and correspond to classical groups: S¹ as U(1), S³ as SU(2), and S⁰ as the finite group. Higher-dimensional spheres don't correspond to any classical Lie groups. But I think this is more of an observation than a proof.\n\nAnother angle is that the only spheres that are Lie groups must have a continuous group operation. For Sⁿ to be a Lie group, it must be an H-space (has a continuous multiplication with identity). Adams showed that the only spheres that are H-spaces are S⁰, S¹, S³, and S⁷. But again, S⁷ isn't a Lie group because of the octonion issue. So even though S⁷ is an H-space, the multiplication isn't associative, so it can't be a Lie group. Hence, only the first three.\n\nBut how to structure this into assumptions and the problem? The original question is asking for a way to show which spheres can be Lie groups, avoiding the parallelizability argument. The key assumptions would be about the sphere being a Lie group, hence a smooth manifold with a group structure where operations are smooth.\n\nSo the problem is to show that the only spheres that can be Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³. The assumptions needed would relate to the properties that a sphere must satisfy to be a Lie group. But the user mentions wanting to avoid the parallelizability part. However, since it's a necessary condition (as any Lie group is parallelizable), maybe that's an assumption. But the user wants to structure the problem by listing assumptions and then the problem.\n\nWait, the example given had assumptions listed as properties on the object (n is an integer, n is divisible by 7). For this problem, the assumptions would be about the sphere being a Lie group. But the question is asking for a proof that only certain spheres can be Lie groups, so the assumptions would be the properties that a sphere must satisfy to be a Lie group. However, the original problem is more of a classification question rather than a proof under given assumptions. \n\nHmm. The example given in the user's instruction was about a divisibility problem where assumptions were specific conditions on n. Here, the problem is more about characterizing which spheres (manifolds) have a Lie group structure. So the assumptions would need to be the necessary conditions for a sphere to be a Lie group. But the user's friend mentioned using differential geometry, maybe de Rham cohomology. So perhaps the assumptions would include that the sphere is a smooth manifold, that it has a Lie group structure, and any other inherent properties. But since the problem is to prove which spheres can be Lie groups, the assumptions would be the given conditions that lead to the conclusion that only S⁰, S¹, S³ are possible. However, the user wants the assumptions listed as separate line items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem as structured would have the assumption that the sphere is a Lie group (i.e., it's a Lie group and also a sphere), and the problem is to show that it must be one of S⁰, S¹, S³. So the assumption is that the sphere is a Lie group, and the problem is to prove that only these three spheres are possible.\n\nBut in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n (being an integer and divisible by 7). Here, the key assumption is that the sphere is a Lie group. However, the user might want to break down the necessary conditions. For example, each assumption could be a necessary condition for a sphere to be a Lie group. Like:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sphere is a smooth manifold,\nThe sphere has a Lie group structure,\nThe sphere is parallelizable,\nThe cohomology ring of the sphere satisfies certain properties,\netc.\n\nBut the problem is to show that under these assumptions, the only spheres possible are those three. But I'm not sure how to list each assumption as a single property applied to one object. The main assumption is that the sphere is a Lie group. However, the user's friend mentioned using de Rham cohomology, so maybe other assumptions relate to the cohomology groups being compatible with a Lie group structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sphere is a Lie group,\nThe sphere is a smooth manifold,\nThe sphere's group operations are smooth maps.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the only such spheres are S⁰, S¹, and S³.\n\nBut perhaps that's too vague. The original question mentions parallelizability as a necessary condition. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sphere is a Lie group,\nA Lie group is parallelizable,\nThe only parallelizable spheres are S⁰, S¹, S³, and S⁷,\nS⁷ does not admit a Lie group structure.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³.\n\nBut the user wants each assumption to address one property applied to one object. So breaking down:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sphere is a Lie group,\nA Lie group is parallelizable,\nThe sphere Sⁿ is parallelizable if and only if n ∈ {0, 1, 3, 7},\nThe sphere S⁷ does not admit a Lie group structure.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the assumptions to be more about the problem's conditions rather than including known theorems. For example, if we are to approach this via cohomology, maybe the assumptions would involve the cohomology groups of the sphere, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is to show which spheres can be Lie groups, the key assumption is that the sphere in question is a Lie group. So:\n\nAssumption:\nSⁿ is a Lie group,\nA Lie group is a smooth manifold with smooth group operations.\n\nProblem:\nShow that n must be 0, 1, or 3.\n\nBut maybe the assistant needs to parse the original question and extract the problem and assumptions as per the example. The original question is asking for an easy way to show which spheres can be Lie groups, mentioning that the answer is S⁰, S¹, S³. The user references parallelizability and cohomology. However, the example given by the user had assumptions listed as given conditions in the problem. Here, the problem is more of a classification question. So perhaps the assumptions would be the necessary conditions (like being parallelizable) that the sphere must satisfy to be a Lie group, leading to the conclusion.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me look back at the example. In the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user might have made a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, it's listed as n is divisible by 7. That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the original example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, the formatted problem lists an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would mean that the problem is actually under the assumption that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So there might be an error in the example. Perhaps the user intended to have a different problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem states for every integer n. This might be a mistake in the example. But regardless, the structure is to list assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nSo for the current problem, the key is to extract the assumptions from the original question. The original question states that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³. The user mentions that a necessary condition is being parallelizable, and that S⁷ is parallelizable but octonions aren't a group. The problem is to show the classification.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- The sphere is a Lie group (hence a smooth manifold with group operations).\n- A Lie group is parallelizable.\n- The only parallelizable spheres are S⁰, S¹, S³, and S⁷.\n- S⁷ cannot be given a Lie group structure.\n\nBut each assumption should be one line, one property applied to one object. So:\n\nAssumption:\nThe sphere Sⁿ is a Lie group,\nA Lie group is parallelizable,\nThe sphere Sⁿ is parallelizable,\nThe only parallelizable spheres are S⁰, S¹, S³, and S⁷,\nS⁷ does not admit a Lie group structure.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³.\n\nBut maybe that's including too many assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to show that the spheres which are Lie groups are those three, given that a Lie group is parallelizable and the parallelizable spheres are those four, but S⁷ can't be a Lie group. So the problem is structured with those assumptions.\n\nBut the user might want to present it as the problem to show the classification, with assumptions being the necessary conditions. However, I think the key here is to structure the problem as per the example. The example took the original problem, which had a general statement (for every integer n), but the formatted problem added an assumption (n divisible by 7). Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless there was a typo in the example. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a mistake, and the formatted version corrected it. Hmm.\n\nIn any case, following the user's example, perhaps the formatted problem here would list the necessary assumptions for the spheres to be Lie groups. But since the original question is asking for a proof of the classification, the assumptions would be the properties that must hold for a sphere to be a Lie group. Each assumption is a single condition.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer requires using that Lie groups are parallelizable, and that only certain spheres are parallelizable, then the assumptions would include those facts. But in the example, the assumption was on the object in the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). So here, the assumptions would be about the sphere Sⁿ:\n\nAssumption:\nSⁿ is a Lie group,\nSⁿ is parallelizable,\nThe only parallelizable spheres are S⁰, S¹, S³, and S⁷,\nS⁷ cannot be a Lie group.\n\nProblem:\nShow that the only spheres which are Lie groups are S⁰, S¹, and S³.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more succinct. Let me try to follow the example strictly. The example took the original problem, which was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem's assumption included n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but if the original problem is for every integer n, why would the assumption include n divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Unless perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the correct assumption is that n is divisible by 7. But regardless, the structure is to list assumptions line by line, each being a single condition.\n\nIn the current problem, the question is to show which spheres can be Lie groups. The necessary conditions are:\n\n1. The sphere is a Lie group.\n2. A Lie group is parallelizable.\n3. The sphere Sⁿ is parallelizable only if n ∈ {0, 1, 3, 7}.\n4. The sphere S⁷ does not admit a Lie group structure.\n\nHence, the formatted problem would list these assumptions and then the problem statement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:",

The proof proceeds via logical deduction using the given assumptions.\n\n**Theorem:** If S^n admits a Lie group structure, then n must be 0, 1, or 3.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Assume S^n is a Lie group.** This is our starting hypothesis (Assumption 1).\n\n2. **Since S^n is a Lie group, it must be parallelizable.** By Assumption 2, every Lie group is parallelizable. Therefore, if S^n has a Lie group structure, it inherits the property of being parallelizable.\n\n3. **Parallelizability of S^n restricts n to the set {0, 1, 3, 7}.** Assumption 3 states that S^n is parallelizable if and only if n ∈ {0, 1, 3, 7}.
