    "Content":"I was wondering on the following and I probably know the answer already: NO . Is there another number with similar properties as $e$ ? So that the derivative of $ e^x$ is the same as the function itself. I can guess that it's probably not, because otherwise $e$ wouldn't be that special, but is there any proof of it?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Of course $C e^x$ has the same property for any $C$ (including $C = 0$). But these are the only ones. Proposition: Let $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function such that $f(0) = 1$ and $f'(x) = f(x)$. Then it must be the case that $f = e^x$. Proof. Let $g(x) = f(x) e^{-x}$. Then $$g'(x) = -f(x) e^{-x} + f'(x) e^{-x} = (f'(x) - f(x)) e^{-x} = 0$$ by assumption, so $g$ is constant. But $g(0) = 1$, so $g(x) = 1$ identically. N.B. Note that it is also true that $e^{x+c}$ has the same property for any $c$. Thus there exists a function $g(c)$ such that $e^{x+c} = g(c) e^x = e^c g(x)$, and setting $c = 0$, then $x = 0$, we conclude that $g(c) = e^c$, hence $e^{x+c} = e^x e^c$. This observation generalizes to any differential equation with translation symmetry. Apply it to the differential equation $f''(x) + f(x) = 0$ and you get the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Alright, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's requirements. The original question is about proving that C e^x is the only set of functions where the function equals its derivative. The user wants me to extract the assumptions and the problem statement, following the example they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the question correctly. The user on Math Stack Exchange is asking if there's another number besides e such that the derivative of a^x is equal to itself. They mention that they think the answer is no, but they want a proof. The title of the question states that C e^x is the only solution to f(x) = f'(x). \n\nNow, looking at the example given, the assumptions were about the properties of the variable involved. In the example, n is an integer and divisible by 7. For the current problem, I need to list each assumption line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object.\n\nThe problem here is to prove that the only functions satisfying f(x) = f'(x) are of the form C e^x. So, the assumptions would relate to the function f. Let me think: the function f must be differentiable (since we're talking about its derivative), and we're considering functions where the derivative equals the function itself. But do I need to state that f is differentiable? The problem statement might assume that since we're dealing with derivatives. However, in the example, the assumptions were about the variable n being an integer and divisible by 7. Here, maybe the assumptions are about the function f. But the original question doesn't state any specific conditions except that f'(x) = f(x). Wait, the example's assumptions included conditions on n, but in this case, the problem is more general. The user is asking if there are functions other than C e^x that satisfy f = f'. So, perhaps the main assumption is that f is a differentiable function satisfying f'(x) = f(x) for all x. But the example's assumptions were listed as separate points. So maybe:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a differentiable function,\nf'(x) = f(x) for all x.\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solutions are f(x) = C e^x, where C is a constant.\n\nBut wait, the original question's title says \"Prove that C e^x is the only set of functions for which f(x) = f'(x)\". The problem statement in the example didn't include the assumptions in the problem line, just the problem itself. So the assumptions are separate.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions here would be the conditions on f. Let me check the original question again. The user says, \"Is there another number with similar properties as e? So that the derivative of e^x is the same as the function itself.\" But the title is about functions, not the base. Wait, there's a slight confusion here. The title mentions functions of the form C e^x being the only solutions, while the question body talks about the base number. However, the key point is that the problem as stated in the title is about functions satisfying f = f', and the answer is that they must be C e^x. The question in the body is about whether another base besides e exists such that a^x differentiates to itself, which is a related but slightly different question. However, since the title is the main problem, I need to focus on that.\n\nSo the problem as per the title is to prove that C e^x are the only functions where f(x) = f'(x). The assumptions would then be that f is differentiable everywhere (since the derivative needs to exist), and that f' = f. So each assumption line by line:\n\nAssumption:\nf is differentiable,\nFor all x, f'(x) = f(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solutions are f(x) = C e^x, where C is a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require f to be differentiable as an assumption because the act of taking the derivative implies differentiability. But in the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" as an assumption. So perhaps here, the key assumption is that f satisfies f'(x) = f(x) for all x. But to take the derivative, f must be differentiable. So maybe both are needed. However, in standard math problems, when we say f' exists, we assume differentiability. But the user's example includes explicit assumptions. So to follow the example, I should list each condition. Let me check the example again:\n\nOriginal problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, with assumptions that n is an integer and divisible by 7. Wait, in the original problem, the user included \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, no. Wait the original problem said \"for every integer n\", but in the formatted problem, the assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7\". But that seems contradictory. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91\". Then the formatted problem's assumption is that n is an integer and divisible by 7. That seems like an error. Wait, maybe the example has a mistake. Because if the original problem says \"for every integer n\", then the assumptions shouldn't include \"n is divisible by 7\". Unless there was a mistake in the example. Hmm. Wait, maybe the original problem actually had an additional condition that n is divisible by 7, but the user wrote it as \"for every integer n\", and then in the formatted problem, they added that assumption. That might be an error in the example. But regardless, following the instructions, the task is to list the assumptions line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove that C e^x are the only functions where f(x) = f'(x). The standard proof of this involves solving the differential equation f' = f, which requires f to be differentiable (and hence continuous). So the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is a differentiable function (since we're taking its derivative),\n2. For all x, f'(x) = f(x).\n\nTherefore, each assumption is on one line. The problem is to show that the only such functions are scalar multiples of e^x.\n\nSo the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nf is differentiable,\nFor all x, f'(x) = f(x).\n\nProblem: Prove that the only solutions are f(x) = C e^x, where C is a constant.\n\nI think that's correct. The original question also mentions \"another number with similar properties as e\", but the title is about the functions. Since the example focuses on the problem as presented in the title, I should follow that. Therefore, the formatted problem is as above.",
