    "Content":"Define a function $f(\\alpha, \\beta)$, $\\alpha \\in (-1,1)$, $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$ as $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}$$ One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem to show that $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\pi \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha \\beta\\right )}}{ \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha\\right )} \\,  \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\beta\\right )}} $$ Clearly, from this latter expression, $f(\\alpha, \\beta) = f(\\beta, \\alpha)$.  My question is, can one see this symmetry directly from the integral expression?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants. Surprisingly, $$\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}\\qquad(\\star)$$ which is obviously symmetric. The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane. By residue theorem, $$\\begin{align}\nI &=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot -2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the right half plane} \\\\\n&=-\\frac1y\\left(\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{+})+\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{-})\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)y}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-1}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c+1}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-2}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c}}{y^{2}-1}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\left(e^{\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}-e^{-\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ For $0<y<1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the left half plane. By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ . In conclusion, $$\\frac1{2\\pi i}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\frac{y^{-\\beta-1}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}d\\beta=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}$$ $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n= \\frac2{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}dxdy$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nThe definition of complex numbers `p_n^{±}` is given as `p_n^{±} = ±(ln x\/(πi) + 1) + 2n = ±c ± 1 + 2n`, where `c = ln x\/(πi)` and `n ∈ ℤ`. This definition arises in the context of contour integration analysis for `f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx`, where the integrand has poles at `z_k = e^{i(π - πβ)}` and `z_k = e^{i(-π + πβ)}`.\n\nThe proof proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Complex Logarithm Definition:** The complex logarithm is defined as `ln x = ln|x| + i arg x`, where `arg x` is the argument of `x`. This definition inherently accounts for the multi-valued nature of the logarithm.\n2.  **Definition of c:** The term `c` is defined as `c = ln x\/(πi)`. This transformation scales and rotates the complex logarithm, making it suitable for relating to the arguments of the poles.\n3.  **Structure ±c ± 1:** The `±c ± 1` structure introduces shifts that are critical for aligning with the specific forms of the pole arguments when divided by `π`.\n4.  **Periodicity (2n):** The addition of `2n` (where `n ∈ ℤ`) is essential to capture all possible branches of the complex logarithm and the periodicity of the arguments, as `arg x` is defined modulo `2π`. When `arg x` is divided by `π`, the `2kπ` periodicity becomes `2k`.\n5.  **Verification with Pole Structure:** The poles of the integrand `1\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²)` are found by solving `1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x² = 0`, which yields `x = -cos(πβ) ± i sin(πβ)`. These can be expressed in exponential form as `e^{i(π - πβ)}` and `e^{i(-π + πβ)}`.\n    *   If we let `x` in `ln x` be one of these poles, say `z = e^{iθ}`, then `ln z = iθ + 2kπi`.\n    *   Therefore, `c = ln z \/ (πi) = (iθ + 2kπi) \/ (πi) = θ\/π + 2k`.\n    *   For the pole `z_1 = e^{i(π - πβ)}`, `θ = π - πβ`, so `c = (π - πβ)\/π + 2k = 1 - β + 2k`.\n    *   For the pole `z_2 = e^{i(-π + πβ)}`, `θ = -π + πβ`, so `c = (-π + πβ)\/π + 2k = -1 + β + 2k`.\n    *   Now, substituting these values of `c` into `p_n^{±} = ±c ± 1 + 2n`:\n        *   If `c = 1 - β + 2k`:\n            *   `c - 1 + 2n = (1 - β + 2k) - 1 + 2n = -β + 2(k+n)`\n            *   `-c + 1 + 2n = -(1 - β + 2k) + 1 + 2n = β + 2(n-k)`\n        *   If `c = -1 + β + 2k`:\n            *   `c + 1 + 2n = (-1 + β + 2k) + 1 + 2n = β + 2(k+n)`\n            *   `-c - 1 + 2n = -(-1 + β + 2k) - 1 + 2n = -β + 2(n-k)`\n    *   In all cases, `p_n^{±}` can represent `±β` (modulo `2`), which are directly related to the arguments of the poles (divided by `π`). This demonstrates that the defined `p_n^{±}` values are consistent with the pole structure and are used in the complex analysis framework to handle the multi-valued nature of the logarithm and the periodicity of the pole arguments.\n6.  **Correspondence:** The `p_n^{±}` values are precisely the transformed arguments of the poles, incorporating the necessary periodicity, making them suitable for use in residue calculations and other aspects of contour integration.\n\nThe proof sketch is correct and provides a sound justification for the definition of `p_n^{±}` in the given context.\n\nProblem: Define complex numbers `p_n^{±} = ±(ln x\/(πi) + 1) + 2n = ±c ± 1 + 2n`, where `c = ln x\/(πi)` and `n ∈ ℤ`. Context: This appears in contour integration analysis of `f(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx`, with poles at `z_k = e^{i(π - πβ)}` and `z_k = e^{i(-π + πβ)}`.\n\nfinal: The definition of complex numbers `p_n^{±}` is `p_n^{±} = ±(ln x\/(πi) + 1) + 2n = ±c ± 1 + 2n`, where `c = ln x\/(πi)` and `n ∈ ℤ`. This definition is correct and consistent with the pole structure `z_k = e^{i(π - πβ)}` and `z_k = e^{i(-π + πβ)}` of the integrand `1\/(1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²)` in the context of contour integration."
