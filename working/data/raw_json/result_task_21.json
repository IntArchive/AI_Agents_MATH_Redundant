    "Content":"I have a friend who turned $32$ recently.  She has an obsessive compulsive disdain for odd numbers, so I pointed out that being $32$ was pretty good since not only is it even, it also has no odd factors.  That made me realize that $64$ would be an even better age for her, because it's even, has no odd factors, and has no odd digits .  I then wondered how many other powers of $2$ have this property.  The only higher power of $2$ with all even digits that I could find was $2048.$ So is there a larger power of $2$ with all even digits?  If not, how would you go about proving it? I tried examining the last $N$ digits of powers of $2$ to look for a cycle in which there was always at least one odd digit in the last $N$ digits of the consecutive powers.  Unfortunately, there were always a very small percentage of powers of $2$ whose last $N$ digits were even. Edit: Here's a little more info on some things I found while investigating the $N$ digit cycles. $N$ : $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ Cycle length: $20,100,500,2500,12500,62520,312500,1562500,\\dotsc, 4\\cdot 5^{N-1}$ Number of suffixes with all even digits in cycle: $10, 25, 60, 150, 370, 925, 2310,5780,\\sim4\\cdot2.5^{N-1}$ It seems there are some interesting regularities there.  Unfortunately, one of the regularities is those occurrences of all even numbers!  In fact, I was able to find a power of $2$ in which the last $33$ digits were even $(2^{3789535319} = \\dots 468088628828226888000862880268288)$ . Yes it's true that it took a power of $2$ with over a billion digits to even get the last $33$ to be even, so it would seem any further powers of $2$ with all even digits are extremely unlikely.  But I'm still curious as to how you might prove it. Edit 2: Here's another interesting property I noticed.  The next digit to the left of the last $N$ digits will take on every value of its parity as the $N$ digits cycle each time.  Let me illustrate. The last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers.  Now examine the following: $2^7 =    128$ $2^{27} = \\dots 728$ $2^{47} = \\dots 328$ $2^{67} = \\dots 928$ $2^{87} = \\dots 528$ $2^{107} = \\dots 128$ Notice that the hundreds place starts out odd and then proceeds to take on every odd digit as the final 2 digits cycle. As another example, let's look at the fourth digit (knowing that the last 3 digits cycle every 100 powers.) $2^{18} = 262144$ , $2^{118} = \\dots 6144$ , $2^{218} = \\dots 0144$ , $2^{318} = \\dots 4144$ , $2^{418} = \\dots 8144$ , $2^{518} = \\dots 2144$ This explains the power of 5 in the cycle length as each digit must take on all five digits of its parity. EDIT 3: It looks like the $(N+1)$ st digit takes on all the values $0-9$ as the last $N$ digits complete half a cycle.  For instance, the last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers, so look at the third digit every $10$ powers: $2^{8}\t= 256$ , $2^{18} = \\dots 144$ , $2^{28}\t= \\dots 456$ , $2^{38}\t= \\dots 944$ , $2^{48}\t= \\dots 656$ , $2^{58}\t= \\dots 744$ , $2^{68}\t= \\dots 856$ , $2^{78}\t= \\dots 544$ , $2^{88}\t= \\dots 056$ , $2^{98}\t= \\dots 344$ Not only does the third digit take on every value 0-9, but it also alternates between odd and even every time (as the Edit 2 note would require.)  Also, the N digits cycle between two values, and each of the N digits besides the last one alternates between odd and even.  I'll make this more clear with one more example which looks at the fifth digit: $2^{20}\t= \\dots 48576$ , $2^{270}\t= \\dots 11424$ , $2^{520}\t= \\dots 28576$ , $2^{770}\t= \\dots 31424$ , $2^{1020}\t= \\dots 08576$ , $2^{1270}\t= \\dots 51424$ , $2^{1520}\t= \\dots 88576$ , $2^{1770}\t= \\dots 71424$ , $2^{2020}\t= \\dots 68576$ , $2^{2270}\t= \\dots 91424$ EDIT 4: Here's my next non-rigorous observation.  It appears that as the final N digits cycle 5 times, the $(N+2)$ th digit is either odd twice and even three times, or it's odd three times and even twice.  This gives a method for extending an all even suffix. If you have an all even N digit suffix of $2^a$ , and the (N+1) th digit is odd, then one of the following will have the (N+1) th digit even: $2^{(a+1*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+2*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+3*4*5^{N-2})}$ Edit 5: It's looking like there's no way to prove this conjecture solely by examining the last N digits since we can always find an arbitrarily long, all even, N digit sequence.  However, all of the digits are distributed so uniformly through each power of 2 that I would wager that not only does every power of 2 over 2048 have an odd digit, but also, every power of 2 larger than $2^{168}$ has every digit represented in it somewhere. But for now, let's just focus on the parity of each digit.  Consider the value of the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ (with $a_0$ representing the 1's place.) $$\na_k = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{2^n}{10^k}\\right\\rfloor \\text{ mod 10}\\Rightarrow a_k = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{2^{n-k}}{5^k}\\right\\rfloor \\text{ mod 10}\n$$ We can write $$2^{n-k} = d\\cdot5^k + r$$ where $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k}\/5^k$ .  So $$\na_k \\equiv \\frac{2^{n-k}-r}{5^k} \\equiv d \\pmod{10}\n$$ $$\\Rightarrow a_k \\equiv d \\pmod{2}$$ And $$d\\cdot5^k = 2^{n-k} - r \\Rightarrow d \\equiv r \\pmod{2}$$ Remember that $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k} \\text{ div } {5^k}$ so $$\\text{The parity of $a_k$ is the same as the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$.}$$ Now we just want to show that for any $2^n > 2048$ we can always find a $k$ such that $2^{n-k} \\text{ mod }5^k$ is odd. I'm not sure if this actually helps or if I've just sort of paraphrased the problem. EDIT 6: Thinking about $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ , I realized there's a way to predict some odd digits. $$2^a \\pmod{5^k} \\text{ is even for } 1\\le a< log_2 5^k$$ The period of $2^a \\pmod{5^k}$ is $4\\cdot5^{k-1}$ since 2 is a primitive root mod $5^k$ .  Also $$2^{2\\cdot5^{k-1}} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{5^k}$$ So multiplying any $2^a$ by $2^{2\\cdot5^{k-1}}$ flips its parity mod $5^k$ .  Therefore $2^a \\pmod{5^k}\\text{ }$ is odd for $$1 + 2\\cdot5^{k-1} \\le a< 2\\cdot5^{k-1} + log_2 5^k$$ Or taking the period into account, $2^a \\pmod{5^k} \\text{ }$ is odd for any integer $b\\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \\le a< 2\\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ Now for the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ ( $ k=0 \\text{ } $ being the 1's digit), we're interested in the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ .  Setting $ a =n-k \\text{  } $ we see that the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ is odd for integer $b\\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \\le n - k < 2\\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ To illustrate, here are some guaranteed odd digits for different $2^n$ : (k=1 digit): $ 2\\cdot5^0 + 2 = 4 \\le n \\le 5 $ (k=2 digit): $ 2\\cdot5^1 + 3 = 13 \\le n \\le 16 $ (k=3 digit): $ 2\\cdot5^2 + 4 = 54 \\le n \\le 59 $ (k=4 digit): $ 2\\cdot5^3 + 5 = 255 \\le n \\le 263 $ Also note that these would repeat every $4\\cdot5^{k-1}$ powers. These guaranteed odd digits are not dense enough to cover all of the powers, but might this approach be extended somehow to find more odd digits? Edit 7: The two papers that Zander mentions below make me think that this is probably a pretty hard problem.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"This seems to be similar to (I'd venture to say as hard as) a problem of Erdős open since 1979, that the base-3 representation of $2^n$ contains a 2 for all $n>8$. Here is a paper by Lagarias that addresses the ternary problem, and for the most part I think would generalize to the question at hand (we're also looking for the intersection of iterates of $x\\rightarrow 2x$ with a Cantor set). Unfortunately it does not resolve the problem. But Conjecture 2' (from Furstenberg 1970) in the linked paper suggests a stronger result, that every $2^n$ for $n$ large enough will have a 1 in the decimal representation. Though it doesn't quantify \"large enough\" (so even if proved wouldn't promise that 2048 is the largest all-even decimal), it looks like it might be true for all $n>91$ (I checked up to $n=10^6$).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to parse this problem and structure it according to the required format. The original question is asking if 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits in base ten. The user has tried various methods like looking at cycles in the last N digits and some modular arithmetic but hasn't found a proof yet.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Each assumption should be a single property or condition applied to one object. Let me read through the problem again to identify the key points.\n\nThe problem is about powers of 2 (2^n) where all digits are even. The user mentions 2^11 = 2048 as the highest such power they found. They want to know if there's a higher one and how to prove it doesn't exist.\n\nAssumptions here would include:\n\n- The number in question is a power of 2 (i.e., 2^n for some integer n).\n- All digits in the base ten representation of the number are even.\n- The problem is asking whether 2048 is the largest such number.\n\nWait, the user also did some analysis on cycles of last N digits, but those might be part of their attempts, not the problem's assumptions. The problem itself is just asking if any power of 2 beyond 2048 has all even digits. So the assumptions for the problem are:\n\n1. The number is a power of 2 (i.e., n is a non-negative integer, 2^n).\n2. All digits in the decimal representation of the number are even.\n\nThe problem statement is: Is 2048 the highest power of 2 with all even digits (base ten)? If not, how to prove it?\n\nBut according to the example, the problem should be phrased as \"Prove that...\" but here it's a question. However, the user wants to know if there's a higher one, and if not, how to prove it. So maybe the problem is to prove that 2048 is the largest power of 2 with all even digits.\n\nWait, the example given in the original instruction was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\" where the assumption included n being an integer and divisible by 7. So here, the problem would be to prove that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits, under the assumptions that we're considering powers of 2 and all their digits in base ten.\n\nBut the user's original question is phrased as \"Is 2048 the highest power of 2 with all even digits (base ten)? If not, how would you go about proving it?\"\n\nBut according to the format, the problem should be structured as:\n\nAssumption: <each assumption line by line>\n\nProblem: <the problem statement>\n\nSo in this case, the assumptions would be:\n\n- The number is a power of 2 (i.e., 2^n for some integer n ≥ 0).\n- All digits in the decimal representation of the number are even.\n\nThen the problem is: Prove that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits, or determine if a higher power exists.\n\nBut the original user is asking whether 2048 is the highest, so the problem is to determine if there exists a power of 2 greater than 2048 with all even digits. If not, prove it.\n\nBut in the example, the problem was to \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91\", so perhaps here the problem is to \"Prove that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits in base ten.\"\n\nHowever, the user hasn't stated any assumptions explicitly except that the number is a power of 2 and digits are even. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- The number is a power of 2.\n- All digits of the number in base ten are even.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a power of 2,\nAll digits of the number in base ten are even.\n\nProblem:\nProve that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits.\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption included specific conditions on n. Here, the assumptions are properties of the number (being a power of 2 and having all even digits). The problem is to show that 2048 is the largest such.\n\nBut perhaps the user's original problem is whether 2048 is the highest, so the problem is \"Is 2048 the highest power of 2 with all even digits (base ten)?\" But according to the example, the problem should be phrased as a statement to prove. So maybe \"Prove that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits in base ten.\"\n\nTherefore, structuring it as:\n\nAssumption:\nThe number is a power of 2,\nAll digits of the number in base ten are even.\n\nProblem:\nProve that 2048 is the highest power of 2 with all even digits.\n\nBut the original user also mentions that they found a power with last 33 digits even but the entire number still has an odd digit. However, those are part of their attempts, not part of the problem statement. The core problem is as above.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct structure. Let me check if I missed any assumptions. The user's problem is about powers of 2 in base 10 with all even digits. No other conditions, so the assumptions are as I listed.",
