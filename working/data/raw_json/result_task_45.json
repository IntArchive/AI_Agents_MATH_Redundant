    "Content":"The \" sum and difference \" formulas often come in handy, but it's not immediately obvious that they would be true. \\begin{align}\n\\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) &= \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\pm \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta \\\\\n\\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) &= \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\mp \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\end{align} So what I want to know is, How can I prove that these formulas are correct? More importantly, how can I understand these formulas intuitively? Ideally, I'm looking for answers that make no reference to Calculus, or to Euler's formula , although such answers are still encouraged, for completeness.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"The key fact here is that rotation is a linear transformation, e.g. the rotation of $u + v$ is the rotation of $u$ plus the rotation of $v$.  You should draw a diagram that shows this carefully if you don't believe it.  That means a rotation is determined by what it does to $(1, 0)$ and to $(0, 1)$. But $(1, 0)$ rotated by $\\theta$ degrees counterclockwise is just $(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta)$, whereas $(0, 1)$ rotated by $\\theta$ degrees counterclockwise is just $(-\\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta)$.  (Again, draw a diagram.)  That means a rotation by $\\theta$ is given by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with those entries.  (Matrices don't work here yet.) So take a rotation by $\\theta$ and another one by $\\theta'$, and multiply the corresponding matrices.  What you get is the sine and cosine angle addition formulas.  (The connection to complex numbers is that one can represent complex numbers as $2 \\times 2$ real matrices.) Also, if you believe that $a \\cdot b = |a| |b| \\cos \\theta$, this implies the cosine angle difference formula when $a$ and $b$ are unit vectors.  Ditto for the cross product and the sine angle difference formula.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to structure the trigonometric sum and difference formulas question into the specified format. First, I need to identify the assumptions. The original question mentions proving the formulas for sine and cosine of α ± β. The assumptions here would be the angles α and β themselves. But wait, the example given in the problem had specific conditions like n being an integer and divisible by 7. However, in this case, the question is more general. The formulas are supposed to hold for any angles α and β, right? So maybe the assumptions are just that α and β are real numbers, or angles in a valid domain where the trigonometric functions are defined.\n\nThe problem statement is to prove and understand these formulas intuitively without calculus or Euler's formula. So the assumptions would be about the angles and perhaps the basic definitions of sine and cosine. Let me check the example again. The example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property applied to one object. Here, the main objects are α and β. So the assumptions would be that α and β are real numbers (angles), and maybe that they are within the domain where sine and cosine are defined. But typically, in trigonometry, these formulas are derived using geometric constructions, assuming α and β are angles in a triangle or unit circle. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption about using a unit circle or geometric approach. But the original problem doesn't specify any restrictions, so the key assumptions are that α and β are angles (real numbers) for which the trigonometric functions are defined. Since trigonometric functions are defined for all real numbers, maybe the assumption is just that α and β are real numbers. However, to be precise, when deriving these formulas geometrically, sometimes they are considered as acute angles. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should list that α and β are real numbers. Alternatively, since the user example didn't have any assumptions beyond n being an integer, maybe here the assumptions are just that α and β are angles, but the problem is to prove the sum and difference formulas. Since the problem is general, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the variables being angles. Wait, the example included an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but in the original problem, the user had \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example added an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. Wait, no, looking back: the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" But in the formatted version, the assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted assumption says \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like an error. Wait, perhaps that example is incorrect. Let me check again. Original problem says: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem's assumptions are: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. If n must be divisible by 7, then the problem would be \"Prove that for every integer n divisible by 7, A(n) is divisible by 91\", but the original problem says \"for every integer n\". So perhaps the example is wrong. But the user provided that example, so maybe they intended to have the assumption that n is an integer, but the problem's conclusion is that A(n) is divisible by 91. However, maybe the user's example mistakenly added an extra assumption. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had a typo and the example is correct. Hmm, this complicates things. But regardless, for the current problem, the user wants to structure the trigonometric sum and difference formulas. The original question states that the formulas are to be proven, and understood intuitively, without calculus or Euler's formula. So the assumptions here would be the basic properties of sine and cosine, perhaps using geometric definitions. But according to the user's format, each assumption should be one property or condition applied to one object. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- α and β are real numbers (angles)\n- The trigonometric functions sine and cosine are defined for α and β\n- The proofs are to be done without calculus or Euler's formula\n\nBut the user's example didn't include the last one as an assumption, but rather as part of the problem statement. Wait, in the example, the problem statement says \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" The assumptions were about n being an integer and divisible by 7. So for the current problem, the assumptions would be about α and β being angles (real numbers), and maybe the trigonometric functions are defined for them. However, since the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on α and β, maybe the assumptions are simply:\n\n- α is a real number\n- β is a real number\n\nBut in trigonometry, angles can be any real numbers, so that's covered. Alternatively, if the proof uses geometric methods, maybe assuming α and β are angles in a certain range, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps just that they are real numbers. The problem then is to prove the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine. Additionally, the problem mentions understanding them intuitively, so maybe that's part of the problem statement. So putting it all together:\n\nAssumptions:\nα is a real number,\nβ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\pm \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\mp \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta,\n\\]\nand provide an intuitive understanding of these formulas.\n\nBut wait, the original question says \"How can I understand and prove the 'sum and difference formulas' in trigonometry?\" So the problem is both proving and understanding. The example's problem statement was \"Prove that... is divisible by 91.\" So following that format, the problem here would be to \"Prove that [formulas] are correct and understand them intuitively.\" But according to the user's instruction, the problem should be written as a single statement. So perhaps:\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\pm \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\mp \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta,\n\\]\nand explain an intuitive understanding of these formulas without using Calculus or Euler's formula.\n\nAlternatively, the problem statement could be split into two parts: proving and understanding. But according to the example, the problem is a single statement. The original question says \"How can I understand and prove...\" so the formatted problem should capture both. Hence, the problem part should include both the proof and the intuitive understanding. The assumptions are just the variables being real numbers. Additionally, perhaps the problem's assumptions include that the proofs avoid Calculus and Euler's formula, but in the example, the assumptions were about the variables, not the method. So the \"no reference to Calculus or Euler's formula\" is part of the problem constraints, not an assumption. Therefore, in the problem statement, it should be mentioned as part of the requirements. So the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nα is a real number,\nβ is a real number.\n\nProblem:\nProve that \n\\[\n\\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\pm \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) = \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\beta \\mp \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\beta,\n\\]\nand provide an intuitive understanding of these formulas without using Calculus or Euler's formula.\n\nYes, that seems right. Each assumption is about one object (α and β) each being real numbers. The problem includes both proving and understanding, with the constraints on methods.",
