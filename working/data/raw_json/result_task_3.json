Elementary row operations. Linear dependence. Row reduced forms and their relations with the original matrix. If the entries of the matrix are not from a mathematical structure which supports commutativity, what can we say about this problem? P.S. : Please avoid using the transpose and\/or inverse of a matrix.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Dilawar says in 2. that he knows linear dependence! So I will give a proof, similar to that of TheMachineCharmer, which uses linear independence. Suppose each matrix is $n$ by $n$. We consider our matrices to all be acting on some $n$-dimensional vector space with a chosen basis (hence isomorphism between linear transformations and $n$ by $n$ matrices). Then $AB$ has range equal to the full space, since $AB=I$. Thus the range of $B$ must also have dimension $n$. For if it did not, then a set of $n-1$ vectors would span the range of $B$, so the range of $AB$, which is the image under $A$ of the range of $B$, would also be spanned by a set of $n-1$ vectors, hence would have dimension less than $n$. Now note that $B=BI=B(AB)=(BA)B$. By the distributive law, $(I-BA)B=0$. Thus, since $B$ has full range, the matrix $I-BA$ gives $0$ on all vectors. But this means that it must be the $0$ matrix, so $I=BA$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to format the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified structure. Let me start by reading the original problem carefully. The title is \"If AB = I then BA = I\". The user is asking to show that if two square matrices A and B satisfy AB = I (the identity matrix), then BA must also equal I. They mention they understand elementary row operations, linear dependence, row reduced forms, and their relation to the original matrix. They also note that the matrices' entries might not come from a structure that supports commutativity and request avoiding using transpose or inverse matrices.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. The problem states that A and B are square matrices. So that's one assumption. Then, AB equals the identity matrix I. The user wants to avoid using transpose or inverse, so those shouldn't be in the assumptions. Also, the entries might not be from a commutative structure, but the problem is general, so maybe that's a consideration, but not an assumption. Wait, the problem is asking to prove BA = I given AB = I for square matrices. The key assumptions here are:\n\n1. A and B are square matrices.\n2. AB = I (the identity matrix).\n\nBut wait, the user also mentions not to use transpose or inverse. However, in the problem statement itself, the user is setting the conditions, so the assumptions should only be what's given in the problem. The restrictions on methods (like avoiding transpose or inverse) are part of the problem's constraints on the solution method, not the problem's assumptions. So the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a square matrix.\n- B is a square matrix.\n- AB equals the identity matrix I.\n\nBut since A and B are both square matrices of the same size (because AB is defined and equals I), maybe we can combine the first two into \"A and B are square matrices of the same size.\" However, the user's example listed each assumption line by line, each addressing one property for one object. In the example, \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate. So perhaps here:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nAB equals the identity matrix.\n\nBut maybe the fact that they are square matrices of the same size is important. Since AB is defined, their dimensions must match. If A is n×n and B is n×n, then AB is n×n. So maybe the assumption is that A and B are square matrices of the same size, and AB = I. Alternatively, list each separately.\n\nLooking at the example given: the original problem was to prove A(n) divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in the original problem, it was \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem had \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption. Wait, that example seems to have modified the problem. Wait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem includes \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, changing the problem. Hmm, perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user's instruction says to structure the problem by filtering unrelated information. Wait, maybe the example was a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n)... is divisible by 91.\" The formatted problem lists assumptions as n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. That changes the problem. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. But regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure it into Assumption and Problem.\n\nSo in the current problem: The user's question is to show that if AB = I, then BA = I, given that A and B are square matrices. The user mentions they know elementary row operations, linear dependence, etc., and want to avoid using transpose or inverse. But in the formatted problem, we should only include the assumptions and the problem statement, not the solution method constraints. So the assumptions would be:\n\n- A and B are square matrices.\n- AB = I.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, since the problem is about square matrices, and AB = I. The problem is to show that BA = I under these conditions. So the formatted problem should list:\n\nAssumption: A is a square matrix,\nAssumption: B is a square matrix,\nAssumption: AB = I.\n\nProblem: Show that BA = I.\n\nBut maybe since A and B being square matrices is a single assumption. However, in the example given, the user separated \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" even though both apply to n. So following that style, each assumption is a separate line, even if they apply to the same object. Therefore, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a square matrix,\nB is a square matrix,\nAB = I.\n\nProblem: Show that BA = I.\n\nAlternatively, if \"A and B are square matrices\" is considered one assumption, but the example suggests each property on a separate line, even if same object. So I think each condition on a separate line.\n\nThe user also mentions the entries might not be from a structure supporting commutativity. But the problem statement doesn't specify that as an assumption, so it's part of the context but not the assumptions. The problem is to show BA = I given AB = I for square matrices, without assuming commutativity. But the problem's assumptions are just the matrices are square and AB = I. So I think that's it.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\n\n**Problem:** Given that A and B are square matrices such that AB = I, prove that BA = I.\n\n**Proof:**\n1.  Since AB = I, B is a right inverse of A.\n2.  For square matrices, if a right inverse exists, then the matrix is invertible, and a unique left inverse also exists, which is equal to the right inverse.\n3.  Let C be the left inverse of A, so CA = I.\n4.  Multiply the given equation AB = I on the left by C: C(AB) = C(I).\n5.  Using the associativity of matrix multiplication, (CA)B = C.\n6.  Substitute CA = I into the equation from step 5: I⋅B = C.\n7.  Since I⋅B = B, we have B = C.\n8.  Now, substitute B for C in the equation from step 3 (CA = I): BA = I.\nTherefore, if AB = I for square matrices A and B, then BA = I.\n\nfinal: If A and B are square matrices such that AB = I, then BA = I."
