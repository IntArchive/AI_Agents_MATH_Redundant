    "AcceptedAnswer":"The matrix $(A - \\lambda I)^{T}$ is the same as the matrix $\\left(A^{T} - \\lambda I\\right)$ , since the identity matrix is symmetric. Thus: $$\\det\\left(A^{T} - \\lambda I\\right) = \\det\\left((A - \\lambda I)^{T}\\right)  = \\det (A - \\lambda I)$$ From this it is obvious that the eigenvalues are the same for both $A$ and $A^{T}$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me read the original question again carefully. The user provided an example where they listed assumptions and then the problem. The original question here is about proving that a matrix and its transpose have the same set of eigenvalues.\n\nFirst, the example they gave included assumptions that were specific conditions. In their example, the assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But in the current problem, the question is more general. Let me check the problem again: \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T) where A^T is the transpose matrix of A.\"\n\nWait, the problem as stated is for any square matrix A, right? Because eigenvalues are defined for square matrices. So the assumptions here might be that A is a square matrix. The original problem doesn't specify that, but eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices. So perhaps the user expects me to include that as an assumption. Let me check if the original question mentions that. The title says \"A matrix and its transpose have the same set of eigenvalues\/other version: A and A^T have the same spectrum\". The question itself says \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T)...\". Since eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices, the assumption here is that A is a square matrix. But the problem statement might not explicitly state that. However, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were taken from the problem. For instance, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", so the assumption was \"n is an integer\". The second assumption in the example was \"n is divisible by 7\", which might have been part of the original problem but was perhaps not stated in the problem statement as presented. Wait, looking back at the example: the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem's assumption includes that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems like maybe there was a mistake. Wait, 91 is 7 times 13, so if n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but in the example, the assumption is n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the problem statement in the example is to prove divisibility by 91. Hmm, that might be an error. But perhaps the user made a typo. Anyway, perhaps the example is just illustrative. So returning to the current problem: the key assumptions here are that A is a square matrix. The problem statement might not explicitly say that, but since eigenvalues are only for square matrices, that's an implicit assumption. So in the formatted problem, should I include \"A is a square matrix\" as an assumption? Let me check the original problem again. The original problem as stated by the user says: \"Let σ(A) be the set of all eigenvalues of A. Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T) where A^T is the transpose matrix of A.\" The problem doesn't specify that A is square, but σ(A) (the spectrum) is only defined for square matrices. Therefore, the assumption must be that A is a square matrix. So I should list that as an assumption. Are there any other assumptions? The problem is general for any square matrix, so maybe there are no other assumptions. So the formatted problem's assumption section would have one line: \"A is a square matrix.\" Then the problem is to show that σ(A) = σ(A^T). Let me check if there are any other implicit conditions. For example, if the field is algebraically closed or if we're working over the complex numbers. But the problem as stated doesn't specify, so perhaps it's over any field. Wait, but eigenvalues are defined for matrices over a field. But the problem might be intended for complex matrices, or it could be general. However, since the user didn't specify, the problem likely assumes a general square matrix over a field where eigenvalues exist. But eigenvalues can exist in any field, but the existence might depend on the field. However, the standard result is that a matrix and its transpose have the same eigenvalues regardless of the field. So perhaps the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption \"A is a square matrix\" and the problem statement as given. Let me confirm with the example provided. The example had assumptions listed even if they were part of the problem statement. For instance, in the example, the problem statement was \"for every integer n\", and that was listed as an assumption. Similarly, in this case, even though the problem doesn't explicitly state \"A is a square matrix\", since σ(A) is defined only for square matrices, that is an implicit assumption, and thus should be listed. Therefore, the correct formatted problem would have Assumption: A is a square matrix. Problem: Show that σ(A) = σ(A^T). But wait, the original problem's title mentions \"other version: A and A^T have the same spectrum\". The problem statement is to show σ(A) equals σ(A^T). So yes, the only assumption needed is that A is a square matrix. So the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \n$A$ is a square matrix.\nProblem: \nShow that $ \\sigma(A) = \\sigma\\left(A^T\\right)$ where $A^T$ is the transpose matrix of $A$.\n###",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nThe proof correctly demonstrates that A and A^T have the same characteristic polynomial, and therefore the same eigenvalues, by leveraging the properties of matrix transpose and determinants.\n\nOriginal Problem: Prove that a square matrix A and its transpose A^T have the same eigenvalues.\n\nFinal Answer:\nProof:\n1. We start by considering the characteristic polynomial of A^T, which is given by det(A^T - λI).\n2. We use the property that the transpose distributes over addition and scalar multiplication: (X + Y)^T = X^T + Y^T and (cX)^T = cX^T.\n3. Applying this, we have (A - λI)^T = A^T - (λI)^T = A^T - λI (since I is a symmetric matrix, I^T = I).\n4. Therefore, A^T - λI = (A - λI)^T.\n5. Next, we use the fundamental property of determinants that for any square matrix M, det(M^T) = det(M).\n6. Applying this property, we get det(A^T - λI) = det((A - λI)^T).\n7. From step 5, det((A - λI)^T) = det(A - λI).\n8. Thus, det(A^T - λI) = det(A - λI).\n9. This shows that the characteristic polynomial of A^T is identical to the characteristic polynomial of A.\n10. Since eigenvalues are defined as the roots of the characteristic polynomial, A and A^T must have the same eigenvalues.\n\nfinal: A square matrix A and its transpose A^T have the same eigenvalues."
