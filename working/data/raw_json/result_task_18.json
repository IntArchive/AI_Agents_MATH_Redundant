    "AcceptedAnswer":"Assuming you mean $e^{ix}=\\cos x+i\\sin x$, one way is to use the MacLaurin series for sine and cosine, which are known to converge for all real $x$ in a first-year calculus context, and the MacLaurin series for $e^z$, trusting that it converges for pure-imaginary $z$ since this result requires complex analysis. The MacLaurin series:\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin x&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}=x-\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n\\cos x&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!}x^{2n}=1-\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\ne^z&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{z^n}{n!}=1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2!}+\\frac{z^3}{3!}+\\cdots\n\\end{align} Substitute $z=ix$ in the last series:\n\\begin{align}\ne^{ix}&=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(ix)^n}{n!}=1+ix+\\frac{(ix)^2}{2!}+\\frac{(ix)^3}{3!}+\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n&=1+ix-\\frac{x^2}{2!}-i\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+i\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\n\\\\\\\\\n&=1-\\frac{x^2}{2!}+\\frac{x^4}{4!}+\\cdots +i\\left(x-\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}-\\cdots\\right)\n\\\\\\\\\n&=\\cos x+i\\sin x\n\\end{align}",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to format the given Math Stack Exchange question according to the specified structure. The original question is about proving Euler's formula: e^{it} = cos t + i sin t. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the assumptions. The example provided had assumptions like \"$n$ is an integer\" and \"$n$ is divisible by 7.\" For Euler's formula, the main assumption is that t is a real number because Euler's formula relates complex exponentials to trigonometric functions with real arguments. Also, the formula uses the exponential function, which in this context is defined for complex numbers, but the exponent here is purely imaginary. So the key assumption is that t is a real variable.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, the user wants the problem restated. The original question is straightforward: \"Prove Euler's formula: e^{it} = cos t + i sin t.\" There are no additional conditions mentioned in the question, so the only assumption is that t is a real number. \n\nWait, but sometimes Euler's formula can be introduced using power series expansions. Do I need to mention any assumptions about the convergence of the series or the differentiability? The example given didn't include such details, so maybe not. The problem is to prove the formula as stated, so the primary assumption is about the domain of t. Therefore, the assumption should be that t is a real number. \n\nSo, structuring it as per the format:\n\nAssumption: t is a real number.\n\nProblem: Prove that e^{it} = cos t + i sin t.\n\nThat should be it. The example didn't have multiple assumptions unless the problem required them. Since Euler's formula is a general statement for real t, that's the only assumption needed here. I don't see any other conditions or objects involved in the problem statement. The user didn't specify any particular constraints or methods to use, so the assumptions are minimal.",

    "mathematician and proof writer":"**Complete Proof:**\n\n**Given:**\n- S is a set of real numbers\n- S is finite with k elements, where k ≥ 1\n- Elements are ordered: s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₖ\n\n**To prove:** S is non-empty\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. By Assumption 2, S is finite with k elements, where k ≥ 1. This directly implies that S contains at least one element, since k ≥ 1 means the set has a positive number of elements.\n\n2. The ordering s₁ < s₂ < ... < sₖ (Assumption 3) further confirms the existence of k distinct elements in S, where k ≥ 1.\n\n3. Since a set with at least one element is, by definition, non-empty, we conclude that S is non-empty.\n\n**Conclusion:** S is non-empty.\n\n**QED**\n\n**Analysis of assumptions:**\n- Assumption 1 (S is a set of real numbers) provides the domain\/type of elements\n- Assumption 2 (S is finite with k elements, k ≥ 1) is the key premise that guarantees non-emptiness\n- Assumption 3 (ordered elements) provides additional structure but is not necessary for the non-emptiness conclusion\n\nSince all assumptions contribute to defining the problem and none can be deduced from the others, there is no redundant assumption.
