    "Content":"As I have heard people did not trust Euler when he first discovered the formula (solution of the Basel problem ) $$\\zeta(2)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$ However, Euler was Euler and he gave other proofs. I believe many of you know some nice proofs of this, can you please share it with us?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"OK, here's my favorite. I thought of this after reading a proof from the book \"Proofs from the book\" by Aigner & Ziegler, but later I found more or less the same proof as mine in a paper published a few years earlier by Josef Hofbauer. On Robin's list, the proof most similar to this is number 9\n(EDIT: ...which is actually the proof that I read in Aigner & Ziegler). When $0 < x < \\pi\/2$ we have $0<\\sin x < x < \\tan x$ and thus\n$$\\frac{1}{\\tan^2 x} < \\frac{1}{x^2} < \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 x}.$$\nNote that $1\/\\tan^2 x = 1\/\\sin^2 x - 1$.\nSplit the interval $(0,\\pi\/2)$ into $2^n$ equal parts, and sum\nthe inequality over the (inner) \"gridpoints\" $x_k=(\\pi\/2) \\cdot (k\/2^n)$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 x_k} - \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} 1 < \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \\frac{1}{x_k^2} < \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 x_k}.$$\nDenoting the sum on the right-hand side by $S_n$, we can write this as\n$$S_n - (2^n - 1) < \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot 2^n}{\\pi} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{k^2} < S_n.$$ Although $S_n$ looks like a complicated sum, it can actually be computed fairly easily. To begin with,\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sin^2 x} + \\frac{1}{\\sin^2 (\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x)} = \\frac{\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x \\cdot \\sin^2 x} = \\frac{4}{\\sin^2 2x}.$$\nTherefore, if we pair up the terms in the sum $S_n$ except the midpoint $\\pi\/4$ (take the point $x_k$ in the left half of the interval $(0,\\pi\/2)$ together with the point $\\pi\/2-x_k$ in the right half) we get 4 times a sum of the same form, but taking twice as big steps so that we only sum over every other gridpoint; that is, over those gridpoints that correspond to splitting the interval into $2^{n-1}$ parts. And the midpoint $\\pi\/4$ contributes with $1\/\\sin^2(\\pi\/4)=2$ to the sum. In short,\n$$S_n = 4 S_{n-1} + 2.$$\nSince $S_1=2$, the solution of this recurrence is\n$$S_n = \\frac{2(4^n-1)}{3}.$$\n(For example like this: the particular (constant) solution $(S_p)_n = -2\/3$ plus the general solution to the homogeneous equation $(S_h)_n = A \\cdot 4^n$, with the constant $A$ determined by the initial condition $S_1=(S_p)_1+(S_h)_1=2$.) We now have\n$$ \\frac{2(4^n-1)}{3} - (2^n-1) \\leq  \\frac{4^{n+1}}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \\frac{1}{k^2}  \\leq \\frac{2(4^n-1)}{3}.$$\nMultiply by $\\pi^2\/4^{n+1}$ and let $n\\to\\infty$. This squeezes the partial sums between two sequences both tending to $\\pi^2\/6$. Voilà!",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure a given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed first, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the formatted problem, only the integer part was kept, and the divisibility by 7 might have been part of the original problem's conditions. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That seems like the original problem might have been different. Wait, maybe the example is hypothetical.\n\nThe user provided an example where the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions include that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems conflicting because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an extra assumption that n is divisible by 7. That suggests maybe there was a mistake in the example. But perhaps the user intended to show how to extract assumptions, even if they are not explicitly stated? Hmm.\n\nBut the key here is that the task is to read the Math Stack Exchange question, filter out unrelated information, and structure it into Assumptions and Problem. The example shows that assumptions are each a single property applied to one object. So, for the given problem about the Basel problem, the user wants to format it accordingly.\n\nThe original problem's title is \"Different ways to prove ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k²=π²\/6 (the Basel problem)\" and the question is asking people to share nice proofs of this formula since Euler's initial proof wasn't trusted, and he provided others. The user wants the assumptions and problem structured.\n\nNow, the Basel problem's statement is that the sum of 1\/k² from k=1 to infinity equals π²\/6. The assumptions here—what conditions are given? The problem is to prove this equality. Are there any implicit assumptions? Typically, in such series problems, the assumptions might include that the series converges, but in the Basel problem, the convergence is part of what's established. However, the problem as stated is just to prove the sum equals π²\/6. Since the original question doesn't specify any particular constraints or conditions (like specific methods to use or restrictions on the proof techniques), there might not be explicit assumptions beyond the series definition.\n\nBut according to the example, the user might expect to list assumptions even if they are basic. For instance, in the example, \"n is an integer\" was an assumption. So here, perhaps the assumption is that k is a positive integer, since the sum starts at k=1. However, in the problem statement, the series is from k=1 to infinity, so each term is 1\/k² where k is a positive integer. So maybe the assumption is that k is a positive integer. But since the problem is about the sum, perhaps that's part of the problem statement, not an assumption.\n\nWait, the example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption when the original problem said \"for every integer n\". So the assumption is derived from the problem's universal quantification. Similarly, in the Basel problem, the sum is over positive integers k starting at 1. So perhaps the assumption is that k is a positive integer. But in the problem statement, the sum is already over k=1 to infinity, so maybe that's part of the problem's setup, not an assumption. The example shows that assumptions can include the domain of variables, even if they are part of the problem's original statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no specific assumptions here beyond what's inherent in the problem. The problem is to prove that the sum equals π²\/6. The user's example included assumptions that were part of the problem's conditions. So if the original problem is just to prove the sum, and there's no additional conditions (like convergence, or specific methods), then maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond the series being defined as it is. However, the example shows that even if the original problem states \"for every integer n\", it's listed as an assumption, so perhaps here, the assumption would be that k is a positive integer, since the sum is from k=1 to infinity.\n\nBut the problem statement as given in the example for the Basel problem is: \"Prove that ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k² = π²\/6\". The assumptions would be that k ranges over positive integers, and the series converges. But convergence is part of what needs to be proven in some approaches, but in others, it's established first. However, in the problem statement, since the sum is stated as equal to π²\/6, perhaps the convergence is assumed. But I'm not sure. The original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking for different proofs, so maybe the assumptions are minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are no specific assumptions needed here. The problem is simply to prove the equality. The example had assumptions because the original problem had conditions (n is an integer). Here, the problem is to prove the sum equals π²\/6. The only assumption might be that the series is defined for positive integers k, but that's inherent in the problem statement. The user might expect to list that k is a positive integer as an assumption. Let's check the example again: in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which became the assumption \"n is an integer\". So similarly, here, since the sum is from k=1 to infinity, the assumption is \"k is a positive integer\".\n\nBut the problem is about the sum, not about a property of k. So perhaps the assumption is that the series converges. But in the Basel problem, proving convergence is part of the process, but sometimes it's assumed. However, in the problem statement as given, the user is just asking to prove the sum equals π²\/6. So maybe the assumptions are:\n\n- The series ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k² converges.\n- Each term in the series is 1\/k² where k is a positive integer.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example didn't include convergence as an assumption; it included the domain of n. So perhaps here, the assumption is that k is a positive integer, since the sum starts at k=1. But the problem statement already specifies that the sum is from k=1 to infinity, so maybe that's redundant. However, following the example's structure, we might list \"k is a positive integer\" as an assumption. But in the example, the problem was about A(n) and the assumption was n is an integer. So similarly, here, the assumption is that k is a positive integer. However, the problem statement includes the sum from k=1 to infinity, which implies that k is a positive integer. But perhaps to list it as an assumption explicitly.\n\nWait, but in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", which was turned into an assumption. Here, the problem is about the sum over k starting at 1, so the assumption is that k is a positive integer. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k² = π²\/6.\n\nBut the original question on Math Stack Exchange is asking for different ways to prove this, so the problem is to prove the equality. Therefore, the formatted problem should have the assumption that k is a positive integer (since the sum is over k=1,2,...), and the problem is to prove the sum equals π²\/6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no assumptions needed here beyond what's in the problem statement. The example included assumptions that were part of the problem's original conditions. In the example, the problem was to prove for every integer n, so the assumption was n is an integer. Here, the problem is about the sum from k=1 to infinity, so the assumption is k is a positive integer. Thus, the formatted problem would have:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k² = π²\/6.\n\nBut maybe also considering that the series converges, but in the problem statement, the sum is given as equal to π²\/6, which implies convergence. However, in mathematical proofs, sometimes convergence is established first. But since the problem is to prove the sum equals that value, perhaps convergence is part of what needs to be proven. Therefore, maybe there are no explicit assumptions beyond k being a positive integer.\n\nAnother angle: the original question mentions that people didn't trust Euler's first proof, so he provided others. The current problem is asking for various proofs. But in the formatted problem, the task is to state the problem and assumptions. The assumptions would be the conditions necessary to state the problem. Since the problem is to prove the sum equals π²\/6, the main assumption is that the series is defined over positive integers k, and possibly that the series converges. However, depending on the proof method, convergence might be assumed or proven. Since the problem is to prove the equality, perhaps the convergence is part of what's to be proven, so it's not an assumption. Hence, the only assumption is that k is a positive integer.\n\nThus, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nk is a positive integer.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1\/k² = π²\/6.\n\nBut let's check the example again. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original example, the problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. However, in the formatted problem, the assumptions were n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake because the original problem's condition was \"for every integer n\", so the formatted problem should not add \"n is divisible by 7\" unless the original problem had that condition. But in the example given by the user, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions. That seems contradictory. Perhaps the example had a typo or the user intended to show that sometimes assumptions are added beyond the original problem's explicit conditions. Alternatively, maybe the original example had a different problem where n needed to be divisible by 7, but the user's example is inconsistent.\n\nGiven that confusion, perhaps the user wants to extract all conditions from the problem statement, even if they are part of the universal quantification. For the Basel problem, since the sum is over k starting at 1, the only assumption needed is that k is a positive integer. Therefore, the formatted problem would be as above.",
