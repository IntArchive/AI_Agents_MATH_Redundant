    "Content":"I am trying to prove the convergence of the $p$ -series $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac1{n^p}.$$ for $p > 1$ . I am wondering if there is a proof that this series converges, either directly or by applying some test for convergence.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"We can bound the partial sums by multiples of themselves: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{2k+1}\n&=&\n\\sum_{n=1}^{2k+1}\\frac{1}{n^p}\\\\\n&=&\n1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p}+\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)\\\\\n&<&1+\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2}{(2i)^p}\\\\\n&=&1+2^{1-p}S_k\\\\\n&<&1+2^{1-p}S_{2k+1}\\;.\n\\end{eqnarray}$$ Then solving for $S_{2k+1}$ yields $$S_{2k+1}<\\frac{1}{1-2^{1-p}}\\;,$$ and since the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it converges. Eight years after I posted this, Zach Teitler pointed out that this proof was already published in $1979$ by Teresa Cohen and William J. Knight in Convergence and Divergence of $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1\/n^p$ , Mathematics Magazine, $52(3)$ , $1979$ , p. $178$ ( accessible version , DOI link ).",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to format this problem according to the user's instructions. The original question is about proving the convergence of the p-series ∑1\/n^p for p > 1. \n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem mentions the series starts at n=1 and goes to infinity, and p is greater than 1. So the assumptions should list each condition separately. The user's example had each assumption on a new line, addressing one property per object.\n\nLooking at the example, they listed \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, the series is from n=1 to infinity, but the key condition is that p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence under these conditions. \n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't mention any other conditions except p > 1. The series is ∑1\/n^p, so the variable is n, and p is a parameter. So the main assumption is p > 1. The problem is to prove convergence for this series when p is greater than 1. \n\nI think the assumptions here are straightforward: p is a real number, p > 1. Each of these should be separate. But maybe the user wants each condition per line. So \"p is a real number\" and \"p > 1\" as two separate assumptions. The problem is to prove that the series converges under these conditions.\n\nI should check if there are other implicit assumptions. The series is from n=1 to infinity, which is standard for p-series, so maybe that's part of the problem statement but not an assumption. The user's example included \"n is an integer\" as an assumption, but in the problem here, n is the summation index, so it's already an integer starting at 1. But the original problem didn't state that as an assumption, so maybe it's not necessary here. The key assumption is p > 1. \n\nSo the formatted problem should have assumptions: p is a real number, p > 1. Then the problem is to prove convergence of the series. \n\nWait, but in the example, they had the assumption that n is an integer even though in the original problem it's implied. So maybe here, even though p is a parameter, we need to list that p is a real number. So the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a real number\n- p > 1\n\nAnd the problem is to prove that the series ∑1\/n^p from n=1 to infinity converges. \n\nThat should be correct. Let me confirm with the example. The example had two assumptions: n is an integer and n divisible by 7. Here, the problem is for p > 1, so the key conditions are p being real and greater than 1. So yes, that's the way to go.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nThe original problem is to prove that the p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$.\n\nProof:\nLet $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{i^p}$ be the $n$-th partial sum of the series.\nSince all terms $\\frac{1}{n^p}$ are positive for $n \\ge 1$, the sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is monotonically increasing. To prove convergence, we need to show that it is bounded above.\n\nConsider the partial sum $S_{2k+1}$:\n1.  We can group the terms of $S_{2k+1}$ as follows:\n    $S_{2k+1} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2^p} + \\frac{1}{3^p}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4^p} + \\frac{1}{5^p}\\right) + \\dots + \\left(\\frac{1}{(2k)^p} + \\frac{1}{(2k+1)^p}\\right)$\n    This can be written as $S_{2k+1} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} + \\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right)$.\n\n2.  For each term in the sum, since $p > 1$ and $2i+1 > 2i$, we have $(2i+1)^p > (2i)^p$.\n    Therefore, $\\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p}$.\n    This implies $\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} + \\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p} < \\frac{1}{(2i)^p} + \\frac{1}{(2i)^p} = \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$.\n\n3.  Summing this inequality over $i=1$ to $k$:\n    $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\left(\\frac{1}{(2i)^p} + \\frac{1}{(2i+1)^p}\\right) < \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$.\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $S_{2k+1}$:\n    $S_{2k+1} < 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{2}{(2i)^p}$.\n\n4.  Simplify the sum:\n    $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{2}{(2i)^p} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{2}{2^p i^p} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{2^{1-p}}{i^p}$.\n    Since $2^{1-p}$ is a constant, we can factor it out:\n    $2^{1-p} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{i^p} = 2^{1-p} S_k$.\n\n5.  Combining the results from steps 3 and 4, we get:\n    $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p} S_k$.\n\n6.  We know that $S_k < S_{2k+1}$ because $S_{2k+1}$ includes all the positive terms of $S_k$ plus additional positive terms.\n    Since $p > 1$, $1-p < 0$, so $2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant.\n    Multiplying the inequality $S_k < S_{2k+1}$ by $2^{1-p}$ gives $2^{1-p} S_k < 2^{1-p} S_{2k+1}$.\n    Adding 1 to both sides: $1 + 2^{1-p} S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p} S_{2k+1}$.\n\n7.  Combining the inequalities from step 5 and step 6:\n    $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p} S_k < 1 + 2^{1-p} S_{2k+1}$.\n    From this, we have $S_{2k+1} < 1 + 2^{1-p} S_{2k+1}$.\n\n8.  Rearranging the inequality to solve for $S_{2k+1}$:\n    $S_{2k+1} - 2^{1-p} S_{2k+1} < 1$\n    $S_{2k+1} (1 - 2^{1-p}) < 1$.\n    Since $p > 1$, we have $p-1 > 0$, so $2^{p-1} > 1$. This means $0 < 2^{1-p} < 1$.\n    Therefore, $1 - 2^{1-p}$ is a positive constant.\n    Dividing by this positive constant:\n    $S_{2k+1} < \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-p}}$.\n\nThis shows that the subsequence of partial sums $\\{S_{2k+1}\\}$ is bounded above by a constant value. Since the sequence of partial sums $\\{S_n\\}$ is monotonically increasing and has a bounded subsequence, it must be bounded itself. An increasing sequence that is bounded above converges.\nTherefore, the p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$.\n\nfinal: The p-series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges for $p > 1$."
