    "Content":"Let $\\pi: X \\times Y \\to X$ be the projection map where $Y$ is compact. Prove that $\\pi$ is a closed map. First I would like to see a proof of this claim. I want to know that here why compactness is necessary or do we have any other weaker condition other than compactness for the same result to hold.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"There is a standard example for why some hypothesis on $Y$ is necessary: let $X=Y=\\mathbb R$ , and consider the closed subset $F=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb R\\times\\mathbb R:xy=1\\}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ . What is its projection to the first factor? In fact, one can prove that a space $Y$ is compact iff for all spaces $X$ the projection $X\\times Y\\to X$ is closed. So while compactness is not necessary (I think...) for the closedness of the projection for one $X$ , it is necessary if you want all such projections to be closed. As for the proof you want in the first bullet point... this is a standard exercise in topology: what have you tried?",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given problem into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions are listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object. Then the problem is stated clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from Math Stack Exchange: The user is asking about the projection map π: X × Y → X being closed, with Y compact. They want a proof and to know why compactness is necessary or if there's a weaker condition.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The projection map π is defined from the product space X × Y to X. The problem states that Y is compact. So the assumptions here are:\n\n1. π: X × Y → X is the projection map.\n2. Y is a compact space.\n\nEach of these applies to one object (π and Y respectively). The problem is to prove that π is a closed map. The second part of the question asks about the necessity of compactness and possible weaker conditions, but since the format example only includes the main problem to prove, maybe I should focus on that part. However, the user's example included an assumption about n being an integer and divisible by 7, even though the original problem just stated \"for every integer n\". Wait, in the example, the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't mention that. Wait, no—looking back, the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem listed assumptions as n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect because the original problem didn't state that n must be divisible by 7; it's for every integer n. So maybe the example has a mistake. Wait, perhaps the example was a different problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example given by the user was:\n\nOriginal problem: Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nProblem: Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, that seems incorrect because the original problem states \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That would change the problem. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Maybe the user intended to structure a problem where n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't have that. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo or an error in the example. But regardless, the task is to structure the given problem according to the format.\n\nSo for the current problem about the projection map, the original question says: Let π: X × Y → X be the projection map where Y is compact. Prove that π is a closed map. The additional questions about necessity of compactness and weaker conditions are part of the original question but perhaps should be excluded from the structured problem part, as the example only included the main problem. Wait, in the example, the formatted problem only includes the main problem, even though the original question had a request for a proof and a follow-up question. So maybe the user wants to extract only the main problem into the \"Problem:\" section, and the assumptions are the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, in the current case, the assumptions are:\n\n- π is the projection map from X × Y to X.\n- Y is compact.\n\nEach as separate lines. Then the problem is to prove that π is a closed map.\n\nBut wait, the original problem's title is \"Projection map being a closed map\", and the question is to prove π is closed when Y is compact. The user also asks about why compactness is necessary and other possible conditions, but according to the example, those might be considered as additional questions not part of the structured problem. So the formatted problem should include only the main problem to prove.\n\nHence, the assumptions are:\n\n1. π: X × Y → X is the projection map.\n2. Y is compact.\n\nProblem: Prove that π is a closed map.\n\nThat should be it. The user's example had a mistake where an extra assumption was added (n divisible by 7), but in this case, the problem states Y is compact, so that's an assumption. The projection map is given as part of the setup.",
