    "Content":"Someone recently asked me why a negative $\\times$ a negative is positive, and why a negative $\\times$ a positive is negative, etc. I went ahead and gave them a proof by contradiction like this: Assume $(-x) \\cdot (-y) = -xy$ Then divide both sides by $(-x)$ and you get $(-y) = y$ Since we have a contradiction, then our first assumption must be incorrect. I'm guessing I did something wrong here. Since the conclusion of $(-x) \\cdot (-y) = (xy)$ is hard to derive from what I wrote. Is there a better way to explain this?  Is my proof incorrect?  Also, what would be an intuitive way to explain the negation concept, if there is one?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Well if I were to explain this in an intuitive way to someone (or at least try), I would like to think of an analogy with walking over the real line, by agreeing that walking left will be walking in the negative direction and walking right in the positive direction. Then I will try to convey the idea that if you are multiplying two numbers (let's suppose they are integers to make things easier to picture) then a product as $2*3$ would just mean that you have to walk right (in the positive direction) a distance of $2$ (say miles for instance) three times, that is, first you walk $2$ miles, then another $2$ miles and finally another $2$ miles to the right. Now you picture where you're at? Well, you're at the right of the origin so you are in the positive section. But in the same way you can play this idea with a negative times a positive. With the same example in mind, what would $-2*3$ mean? First, suppose that the $-2$ just specifies that you will have to walk left a distance of $2$ miles. Then how many times you will walk that distance? Just as before $3$ times and in the end you'll be $6$ miles to the left of the origin so you'll be in the negative section. Finally, you'll have to try to picture what could $(-2)*(-3)$ mean. Maybe you could think of the negative sign in the second factor to imply that you change direction, that is, it makes you turn around and start walking the specified distance. So in this case the $-2$ tells you to walk left a distance of $2$ miles but the $-3$ tells you to first turn around, and then walk $3$ times the $2$ miles in the other direction, so you'll end up walking right and end in the point that is $6$ miles to the right of the origin, so you'll be in the positive section, and $(-2)*(-3) = 6$ . I don't know if this will help, but it's the only way I can think of this in some intuitive sense.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure the problem from the Math Stack Exchange question. The user is asking about why a negative times a negative is positive and a negative times a positive is negative. They also mentioned their attempt at a proof by contradiction and are wondering if their approach is correct or if there's a better way to explain it.\n\nFirst, I need to list the assumptions. The original problem is about the multiplication rules for negative numbers. The user's proof assumes that (-x)*(-y) = -xy, leading to a contradiction. But the problem here is to explain why the product is positive instead. So the assumptions would be related to the properties of real numbers under multiplication.\n\nLet me think: The user is working within the real number system, so the basic axioms apply. The key properties here are the distributive property, the existence of additive inverses, and maybe the multiplicative identity. Also, the user is trying to use proof by contradiction, so the assumption for their proof would be that (-x)*(-y) equals -xy instead of xy. However, in the problem statement, the user is asking whether their proof is correct and for a better explanation. But according to the format example, the assumptions should be the conditions given in the problem. Wait, the example for the original problem had an assumption that n is an integer and divisible by 7, but in the original problem, it's stated \"for every integer n\", which might not require divisibility by 7. Wait, maybe the example had a mistake? Wait, looking back: the original problem in the example was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example was wrong. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example? Hmm. But regardless, the task here is to structure the current problem.\n\nSo the problem here is to explain why (-) * (-) = +, and (-) * (+) = -, and whether the user's proof by contradiction is valid. The assumptions would include the properties of real numbers, such as distributive law, associative, commutative, additive inverses, etc. But the user's own assumption in their attempted proof is that (-x)*(-y) = -xy, leading to a contradiction. However, in the problem as posed, the main question is about the validity of their proof and seeking an intuitive explanation. So perhaps the assumptions are the basic axioms of arithmetic operations, and the user's assumption in their proof. Wait, but according to the example, assumptions are the problem's conditions. The original problem in the example had an assumption that n is an integer and that n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which would mean that the assumption is just that n is an integer. The example's formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which might not be correct. But maybe the example was a different problem. Wait, perhaps the user in the example made a mistake. Anyway, focusing back on the current problem.\n\nThe user's problem is to explain why the product of negatives is positive, and whether their proof by contradiction is valid. The assumptions here would be the properties of real numbers, such as:\n\n- The distributive property holds: a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n- The existence of additive inverses: for any x, there exists -x such that x + (-x) = 0.\n- Multiplicative identity: 1 * x = x.\n- 0 * x = 0.\n- The product of a positive and a negative is negative (though this might be part of what needs to be proven, so maybe not an assumption).\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem's assumptions are the basic axioms of ring theory, since integers form a ring, and these properties are derived from there. However, the user is working in a context where they might not know ring axioms. Alternatively, the assumptions could be the properties that the user is taking for granted, such as:\n\n- Multiplication distributes over addition.\n- The product of a positive and a negative number is negative (as given in the problem statement).\n- The definition of negative numbers as additive inverses.\n\nBut in the problem, the user is trying to prove that (-x)*(-y) = xy and that (-x)*y = -xy. So perhaps the assumptions are the standard field axioms for real numbers. But since the user is asking for an intuitive explanation and validation of their proof, perhaps the assumptions are the properties that the user is using in their proof. For example, in their proof by contradiction, they assume (-x)*(-y) = -xy and then divide both sides by (-x) to get (-y) = y, which is a contradiction unless y=0. But dividing by (-x) assumes that (-x) is not zero, which requires x ≠ 0. So the assumptions in their proof are that x ≠ 0, and the usual properties of division.\n\nBut the problem as posed is not stating specific conditions, but rather asking about the general rule. Therefore, the assumptions for the problem would be the standard arithmetic axioms, and the problem is to explain why the product rules hold, and whether the user's proof is valid.\n\nSo structuring this according to the format:\n\nAssumptions:\n- The real numbers follow the field axioms (distributive property, additive inverses, etc.).\n- For any real number x, (-x) is the additive inverse of x.\n- Multiplication is commutative and associative.\n- The product of a positive and a negative real number is negative.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem doesn't need all these. The user's question is more about the multiplication rules, so perhaps the key assumptions are the distributive property and the existence of additive inverses. Also, the user's attempted proof uses division, which assumes multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements.\n\nHowever, in the example given by the user, the assumptions were listed as two separate points: \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the user didn't state that n is divisible by 7; perhaps that was a mistake in the example. So, perhaps the correct approach here is to list the basic assumptions that are given in the problem. Since the user is asking about why (-)(-) = +, the problem is to prove that under the standard arithmetic axioms. So the assumptions would be the field axioms of real numbers.\n\nBut the problem as posed in the Stack Exchange question doesn't explicitly state any assumptions; it's a general question. However, when structuring it according to the example, we need to list the assumptions. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- Multiplication of real numbers follows the distributive property.\n- Every real number has an additive inverse.\n- The product of a positive real number and a negative real number is negative.\n\nBut since the user is asking about both (-)(-) and (-)(+), maybe the assumptions need to cover the existing rules. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to derive these rules from more fundamental axioms. So the assumptions would be the field axioms, and the problem is to prove that (-a)(-b) = ab and (-a)b = -ab.\n\nBut the user's specific problem is asking about their proof by contradiction and for an intuitive explanation. So perhaps the assumptions for their proof are:\n\n- If (-x)*(-y) = -xy, then dividing both sides by (-x) gives (-y) = y, which is a contradiction unless y=0.\n- Division by (-x) is valid (i.e., x ≠ 0).\n\nBut this seems like part of their attempted proof, not the problem's assumptions. The actual problem's assumptions are the axioms of real numbers. However, in the example provided, the assumptions were about the variable n. So perhaps in this case, the problem doesn't have specific numerical assumptions but rather relies on the properties of real numbers. However, the example might have been structured differently. Given that the example included assumptions even when the original problem didn't state them (like n divisible by 7), perhaps the task here is to extract any implicit assumptions from the problem.\n\nIn the user's question, they mention their proof attempt where they assume (-x)(-y) = -xy and reach a contradiction. Therefore, the assumptions here are:\n\n- For real numbers x and y, the product (-x)(-y) is being considered.\n- The properties of real numbers allow division by non-zero elements.\n- The distributive property holds.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is to show that (-x)(-y) = xy using the field axioms, and to evaluate the user's proof attempt. So the assumptions would include the field axioms, and the problem is to prove the multiplication rules, addressing whether the user's proof is valid.\n\nPutting this together, the formatted problem should list the assumptions related to the properties used in the proof and the problem statement. However, since the original question is a general one about why the multiplication rules hold, the assumptions might be the field axioms. But to fit the example's format, perhaps list the key properties assumed.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's proof involves division, maybe the assumptions include that x is non-zero (so division by (-x) is valid). But the problem as a whole is about real numbers in general.\n\nWait, the example given by the user for their own problem had two assumptions: n is an integer, and n is divisible by 7. But in the original problem, it was stated as \"for every integer n\", so the first assumption is correct (n is integer), but the second assumption (divisible by 7) was not part of the original problem. That suggests that maybe in the example, the user made a mistake, or perhaps the original problem had a typo. Either way, the example might not be perfectly structured. But following the user's instruction, I need to structure the current problem according to the format.\n\nGiven that, for the current problem about negative times negative, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x and y are real numbers.\n- The distributive property holds for real numbers.\n- Every real number has an additive inverse.\n- Multiplication is commutative.\n\nBut perhaps the key assumption here is the distributive property. Let's see.\n\nThe standard proof that (-a)(-b) = ab uses the distributive property. Let me recall:\n\nConsider (a + (-a)) = 0. Multiply both sides by b: (a + (-a))b = 0*b => ab + (-a)b = 0. Therefore, (-a)b = -ab. Similarly, then take (-a)(-b) + (-a)b = (-a)(-b + b) = (-a)(0) = 0. Therefore, (-a)(-b) = -(-ab) = ab.\n\nSo this proof uses distributivity and the existence of additive inverses.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would include the distributive property and the properties of additive inverses.\n\nBut the problem as posed by the user is about explaining why (-)(-) = + and whether their proof is correct. The user's proof assumes (-x)(-y) = -xy, then divides by (-x) to get (-y) = y, leading to a contradiction unless y=0. But this only shows that if (-x)(-y) = -xy, then y must be 0, which is a contradiction for general y. Therefore, the user's proof is valid under the assumption that x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0. However, the problem is to prove it for all real numbers, so the user's proof is valid in showing that (-x)(-y) cannot be -xy unless y=0, hence it must be xy.\n\nBut in the problem's assumptions, we need to list the conditions. The user's proof uses division by (-x), so x must not be zero. Therefore, the assumptions would be:\n\n- x and y are non-zero real numbers.\n- The distributive property holds.\n- Division by non-zero real numbers is valid.\n\nBut the original problem is not restricted to non-zero x and y. However, the user's proof only works when x ≠ 0. So the assumption in their proof is x ≠ 0, but the actual problem's assumptions are general. Therefore, to structure the problem as per the example, perhaps:\n\nAssumption:\n- x and y are real numbers.\n- The distributive property holds for real numbers.\n- Every real number has an additive inverse.\n- Multiplication by zero yields zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (-x) * (-y) = xy and (-x) * y = -xy using the properties of real numbers. Evaluate the validity of the proof by contradiction presented, which assumes (-x)(-y) = -xy and derives a contradiction by dividing both sides by (-x).\n\nBut the original problem's exact question is: \"Why is negative times negative = positive? ... Is my proof incorrect? Also, what would be an intuitive way to explain...\"\n\nSo the problem is to explain why (-)(-) = +, determine if the user's proof is correct, and provide an intuitive explanation.\n\nTherefore, the structured problem would have assumptions related to real number properties, and the problem is to address those questions.\n\nPutting this all together, the formatted problem should have assumptions listed as the necessary properties (distributive, additive inverses, etc.), and the problem statement asking to prove the rules, validate the proof, and provide intuition.\n\nBut following the example, which listed assumptions as separate points, each addressing one property or condition for one object. So for example:\n\nAssumption:\n- The real numbers follow the distributive property.\n- For any real number x, there exists an additive inverse -x.\n- Multiplication is commutative.\n- Multiplying any real number by zero yields zero.\n\nProblem:\nProve that a negative times a negative is a positive and a negative times a positive is a negative. Evaluate the validity of the proof by contradiction that assumes (-x)(-y) = -xy and derives a contradiction by division, and provide an intuitive explanation.\n\nBut perhaps more concise. The original problem's question is asking specifically about their proof and the explanation.\n\nSo final structured format:\n\nAssumption:\n- Real numbers satisfy the distributive property.\n- Every real number has an additive inverse.\n- Division by a non-zero real number is valid.\n- Multiplication is commutative.\n\nProblem:\nProve that (-x)(-y) = xy and (-x)y = -xy. Determine if the proof by contradiction (assuming (-x)(-y) = -xy, leading to (-y) = y upon division by (-x)) is valid, and provide an intuitive explanation for why a negative times a negative is positive.\n\nBut the user's original problem mentions \"Someone recently asked me why a negative × a negative is positive, and why a negative × a positive is negative, etc.\" So the problem is to explain both rules, validate their proof, and give intuition.\n\nThus, the assumptions are the field axioms necessary for the proof, and the problem includes proving the rules, validating the user's proof, and providing intuition.",
