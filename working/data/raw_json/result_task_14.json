    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking how to prove the summation formulas for sine and cosine series where the angles are in arithmetic progression. The given formulas are for the sum of cos(a + kd) from k=0 to n-1 and similarly for sine.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if there's a standard method to sum such trigonometric series. I remember that these sums can be derived using complex exponentials or by using trigonometric identities. Let me think about the complex exponential approach. Euler's formula relates sine and cosine to exponentials, so maybe expressing the sum in terms of exponentials would make it easier to handle.\n\nAlternatively, there's a possibility of using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since exponentials form a geometric sequence. If I can write the cosine terms as the real part of a complex exponential, then sum them up as a geometric series, and then take the real part at the end, that might work. Similarly for the sine terms as the imaginary part.\n\nLet me try that. Let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd) + i sin(a + kd). By Euler's formula, this is equal to sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(a + kd)}. This is a geometric series with the first term e^{ia} and common ratio e^{id}. The sum of a geometric series is (1 - r^n)\/(1 - r) when r ≠ 1. So, applying that formula here, the sum S would be e^{ia} * (1 - e^{idn}) \/ (1 - e^{id}).\n\nThen, separating the real and imaginary parts would give the sums for cosine and sine respectively. Let me work through that. Let's compute the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1 - e^{idn} = 1 - cos(dn) - i sin(dn)\nDenominator: 1 - e^{id} = 1 - cos(d) - i sin(d)\n\nTo simplify this expression, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. The complex conjugate of the denominator is 1 - cos(d) + i sin(d). Let's perform that multiplication:\n\nNumerator * Conjugate Denominator:\n[1 - cos(dn) - i sin(dn)] * [1 - cos(d) + i sin(d)]\n\nDenominator * Conjugate Denominator:\n[1 - cos(d) - i sin(d)] * [1 - cos(d) + i sin(d)] = (1 - cos(d))^2 + (sin(d))^2 = 2(1 - cos(d))\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to simplify the original expression. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities for sum of cosines in arithmetic progression.\n\nAnother approach: Using the identity for sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd). There's a formula that involves the sine of (n*d\/2) divided by sine(d\/2) multiplied by cosine of (a + (n-1)d\/2). That's exactly the formula given here. Similarly for sine.\n\nBut how to derive this? Let me recall the identity for the sum of cosines with equally spaced angles. The standard approach is to use the sum-to-product identities recursively, but that might be tedious. Instead, perhaps using induction?\n\nAlternatively, multiply both sides by 2 sin(d\/2) and use telescoping products. That might work. Let's try that for the cosine sum.\n\nLet S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(a + kd). Multiply both sides by 2 sin(d\/2):\n\n2 sin(d\/2) * S = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2 sin(d\/2) cos(a + kd)\n\nUsing the identity: 2 sin A cos B = sin(A + B) + sin(B - A). Let A = d\/2 and B = a + kd. Then:\n\n2 sin(d\/2) cos(a + kd) = sin(a + kd + d\/2) + sin(a + kd - d\/2) = sin(a + (k + 1\/2)d) + sin(a + (k - 1\/2)d)\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n-1} [sin(a + (k + 1\/2)d) + sin(a + (k - 1\/2)d)]\n\nBreaking this into two sums:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n-1} sin(a + (k + 1\/2)d) + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} sin(a + (k - 1\/2)d)\n\nLet’s adjust the indices for each sum. For the first sum, let m = k + 1, which runs from m = 1 to m = n:\n\nsum_{m=1}^{n} sin(a + (m - 1\/2)d)\n\nFor the second sum, let m = k - 1, which runs from m = -1 to m = n-2. But this seems messy. Wait, maybe there is telescoping here. Let me write out the terms:\n\nFirst sum (k=0 to n-1):\n\nsin(a + d\/2) + sin(a + 3d\/2) + ... + sin(a + (2n -1)d\/2)\n\nSecond sum (k=0 to n-1):\n\nsin(a - d\/2) + sin(a + d\/2) + ... + sin(a + (2n -3)d\/2)\n\nSo when we add these two sums, most terms cancel except the first term of the second sum and the last term of the first sum:\n\nTotal sum = [sin(a + (2n -1)d\/2) - sin(a - d\/2)]\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 sin(d\/2) * S = sin(a + (2n -1)d\/2) - sin(a - d\/2)\n\nUsing the identity sin X - sin Y = 2 cos((X + Y)\/2) sin((X - Y)\/2)\n\nLet X = a + (2n -1)d\/2, Y = a - d\/2\n\nThen:\n\nsin X - sin Y = 2 cos( (X + Y)\/2 ) sin( (X - Y)\/2 )\n\nCompute (X + Y)\/2 = [a + (2n -1)d\/2 + a - d\/2]\/2 = [2a + (2n -1)d\/2 - d\/2]\/2 = [2a + (2n -2)d\/2]\/2 = [2a + (n -1)d]\/2 = a + (n -1)d\/2\n\n(X - Y)\/2 = [a + (2n -1)d\/2 - a + d\/2]\/2 = [ (2n -1)d\/2 + d\/2 ]\/2 = [2n d \/2 ] \/2 = (n d)\/2\n\nSo sin X - sin Y = 2 cos(a + (n -1)d\/2) sin(n d \/2)\n\nTherefore:\n\n2 sin(d\/2) S = 2 cos(a + (n -1)d\/2) sin(n d \/2)\n\nDivide both sides by 2 sin(d\/2):\n\nS = [sin(n d \/2) \/ sin(d\/2)] * cos(a + (n -1)d\/2)\n\nWhich is the formula given. Similarly for the sine sum, the process is analogous but using the imaginary parts. Alternatively, multiply by 2 sin(d\/2) and use the identity for sine terms. The key idea is the telescoping when multiplying by 2 sin(d\/2). This seems like the right approach. The same method can be applied to the sine series, using the identity for 2 sin(d\/2) sin(a + kd) which would involve cos terms and telescoping as well.\n\nSo the main steps are: multiply the sum by 2 sin(d\/2), apply a trigonometric identity to each term to convert the product into a sum of sines, then observe that the resulting sum telescopes, leaving only the first and last terms. Then apply the sine difference identity to simplify and solve for the original sum.",
