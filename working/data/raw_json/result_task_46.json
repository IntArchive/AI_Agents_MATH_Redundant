    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to format the given problem according to the user's requirements. The user wants me to act as a mathematics professor and structure the problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified format. The example provided shows that the assumptions should list each condition applied to one object, line by line. Then the problem statement follows.\n\nLooking at the original question titled \"Proof of Frullani's theorem,\" the user is asking how to prove the theorem. The problem states that f is a continuously differentiable function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, with the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity being 0. Also, a and b are positive real numbers. The integral to prove is ∫₀^∞ (f(ax) - f(bx))\/x dx = f(0)(ln(b\/a)).\n\nFirst, I need to extract all the assumptions. The function f is defined on [0, ∞), it's continuously differentiable (so both f and its derivative are continuous), and the limit as x approaches infinity is 0. The constants a and b are in (0, ∞). Each of these should be separate assumptions. \n\nWait, the example had \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. So here, each property for each object should be separate. The function f has multiple properties: domain, codomain, continuous differentiability, and the limit condition. Each of these is a separate assumption. Then a and b are positive real numbers. So that's another assumption. So listing them:\n\n- f is a function from [0, ∞) to ℝ\n- f is continuously differentiable\n- The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 0\n- a and b are positive real numbers\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption line by line, even if they apply to the same object. For instance, in the example, both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" are separate lines. So here, even though \"f is continuously differentiable\" and the limit condition both apply to f, they should be separate lines. Similarly, a and b are two parameters, but the problem states they are in (0, ∞), so maybe \"a and b are positive real numbers\" is one assumption since they're both parameters. But according to the example, each assumption should address only one property or condition applied to one object. So maybe \"a is a positive real number\" and \"b is a positive real number\" as separate lines? Wait, in the example, the original problem said \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". But in the original problem, the divisibility by 7 wasn't mentioned; the example might have been a modified problem. Wait, the user's example shows that they restructured the original problem, which might have included additional assumptions. Wait, the original example problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so maybe the user in the example added an extra assumption? Hmm, perhaps the example was a modified version. Maybe in the actual problem, there was an implicit assumption that n is divisible by 7, but the original problem didn't state that. Wait, no, the original problem in the example was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which might not be correct. Wait, perhaps the example was a mistake. But regardless, the user is asking me to follow their format, which seems to break down each assumption into separate lines, each addressing one property or condition of one object.\n\nSo in the current problem, the function f has several properties: domain [0, ∞), codomain ℝ, continuously differentiable, and the limit as x→infty is 0. Each of these should be separate assumptions. Then a and b are in (0, ∞), so each as a separate line? Or since they are both parameters, maybe \"a and b are positive real numbers\" as a single assumption. But the example had separate lines for n being integer and n being divisible by 7, even though both apply to n. So in this case, for a and b, perhaps two separate assumptions: \"a is a positive real number\" and \"b is a positive real number\". Alternatively, since they are mentioned together in the problem, maybe \"a and b are positive real numbers\" as one assumption. The problem statement says \"let a,b ∈ (0, ∞)\", which is a single condition. So perhaps that's one assumption. However, the example splits two conditions on n into separate lines. Hmm. To adhere strictly to the example's style, perhaps split into separate assumptions if possible. But in this case, a and b are given as both positive, so maybe it's a single assumption. Let's check the example again: the original problem was \"for every integer n\", and the formatted assumption was \"n is an integer\", \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but the original problem didn't say n is divisible by 7. The user might have restructured it incorrectly, but following their approach, perhaps any condition, even if not explicitly stated, should be listed. Wait, no, in the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. But the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which seems like a mistake. Unless there was a miscommunication. Wait, perhaps the original problem actually had n divisible by 7, and the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is demonstrating how to structure even if the original problem has multiple conditions. But regardless, the instruction says to \"filter the unrelated informations\" and structure the problem. So perhaps in the given problem, we need to list all the given assumptions, each as a separate line.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: the user says \"Let f: [0, ∞) → ℝ be a continuously differentiable function such that lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0, and let a,b ∈ (0, ∞). Prove that the integral equals f(0) ln(b\/a).\"\n\nSo the assumptions are:\n\n1. f is defined from [0, ∞) to ℝ.\n2. f is continuously differentiable.\n3. lim_{x→∞} f(x) = 0.\n4. a and b are in (0, ∞).\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. So in the formatted problem, each should be a line under \"Assumption:\".\n\nThen the problem is to prove the integral equals f(0) ln(b\/a).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAssumption:\nf is a function from [0, ∞) to ℝ,\nf is continuously differentiable,\nthe limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 0,\na and b are positive real numbers.\n\nProblem:\nProve that $$\n\\int\\limits_0^{\\infty}  {\\frac{{f\\left( {ax} \\right) - f\\left( {bx} \\right)}}\n{x}}dx  = f\\left( 0 \\right)\\left[ {\\ln \\frac{b}\n{a}} \\right]\n$$\n\nWait, but in the example, the assumption lines are each specific. For instance, in the example, the original problem was for every integer n, but the formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7, which wasn't in the original. That seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong, but the user wants me to follow their approach. Wait, maybe the example was a different problem. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal example problem: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) = 5^n(5^n +1) -6^n(3^n +2^n) is divisible by 91.\n\nFormatted problem's assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\n\nBut the original problem states \"for every integer n\", which doesn't include divisibility by 7. So the formatted problem in the example is incorrect. That suggests that perhaps the user made a mistake in their example, but they want me to follow their structure regardless. Therefore, in the current problem, I should list all the given assumptions as separate lines.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nf is a function from [0, ∞) to ℝ,\nf is continuously differentiable,\nthe limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is 0,\na and b are positive real numbers.\nProblem:\nProve that $$\n\\int\\limits_0^{\\infty}  {\\frac{{f\\left( {ax} \\right) - f\\left( {bx} \\right)}}\n{x}}dx  = f\\left( 0 \\right)\\left[ {\\ln \\frac{b}\n{a}} \\right]\n$$\n###\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the user wrote \"Prove that $$A(n) = ...$$ is divisible by 91.\" So in the problem line, it's restating the expression. Similarly, here, the problem line should restate the integral expression. The assumptions are as listed.\n\nI think that's correct. Each assumption is a separate line, addressing one property or condition of one object. The function f has three separate conditions, a and b have one condition together. Alternatively, maybe split a and b into two lines? The example didn't split parameters mentioned together. In the example, \"a,b ∈ (0, ∞)\" was presented as a single condition. But the example's original problem had \"for every integer n\", which was split into \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Wait, but in reality, if the problem says \"a and b are positive real numbers\", that's a single condition. So perhaps it's better to keep them as one line. Unless the problem mentions them separately, like \"a is positive, b is positive\", but in the problem statement, it's \"a,b ∈ (0, ∞)\", so one condition.\n\nThus, the final formatted problem should have four assumptions: function's domain and codomain, continuous differentiability, limit at infinity, and a, b being positive. Each as separate lines.",
