    "Content":"Let $p$ be a prime. How do I prove that $x^p-x+a$ is irreducible in a field with $p$ elements when $a\\neq 0$? Right now I'm able to prove that it has no roots and that it is separable, but I have not a clue as to how to prove it is irreducible. Any ideas?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Greg Martin and zyx have given you IMHO very good answers, but they rely on a few basic facts from Galois theory and\/or group actions. Here is a more elementary but also a longer approach. Because we are in a field with $p$ elements, we know that $p$ is the characteristic of our field. Hence, the polynomial $g(x)=x^p-x$ has the property $$g(x_1+x_2)=g(x_1)+g(x_2)$$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two elements of an extension field of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. By little Fermat we know that $g(k)=k^p-k=0$ for all $k\\in \\Bbb{F}_p$. Therefore, if $r$ is one of the roots of $f(x)=x^p-x+a$, then $$f(r+k)=g(r+k)+a=g(r)+g(k)+a=f(r)+g(k)=0,$$ so all the elements $r+k$ with $k \\in \\Bbb{F}_p$ are roots of $f(x)$, and as there are $p$ of them, they must be all the roots. It sounds like you have already shown that $r$ cannot be an element of $\\Bbb{F}_p$. Now assume that $f(x)=f_1(x)f_2(x)$, where both factors $f_1(x),f_2(x)\\in \\Bbb{F}_p[x]$. From the above consideration we can deduce that\n$$\nf_1(x)=\\prod_{k\\in S}(x-(r+k)),\n$$\nwhere $S$ is some subset of the field $\\Bbb{F}_p$. Write $\\ell=|S|=\\deg f_1(x)$. Expanding the product we see that\n$$\nf_1(x)=x^\\ell-x^{\\ell-1}\\sum_{k\\in S}(r+k)+\\text{lower degree terms}.\n$$\nThis polynomial was assumed to have coefficients in the field $\\Bbb{F}_p$. From the above expansion we read that the coefficient of degree $\\ell-1$ is $|S|\\cdot r+\\sum_{k\\in S}k$. This is an element of $\\Bbb{F}_p$, if and only if the term $|S|\\cdot r\\in\\Bbb{F}_p$. Because $r\\notin \\Bbb{F}_p$, this can only happen if $|S|\\cdot1_{\\Bbb{F}_p}=0_{\\Bbb{F}_p}$. In other words $f_1(x)$ must be either of degree zero or of degree $p$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to structure this problem according to the required format. The original question is about proving that the polynomial x^p - x + a is irreducible over a field with p elements when a is not zero. \n\nFirst, I need to list all the assumptions. Let's parse the problem carefully. The user mentions a prime p, so that's one assumption. Then, the field in question has p elements, which is another condition. The polynomial is x^p - x + a, and a is not equal to zero. Each assumption should be a single property applied to one object.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n1. p is a prime. (This is a property of p.)\n2. The field has p elements. (This specifies the field's size.)\n3. a is an element of the field (implicit since the polynomial is over the field), and specifically a ≠ 0. (Two separate conditions here, but a ≠ 0 is a single condition applied to a.)\n\nWait, the problem states \"in a field with p elements\", so the field is explicitly given to have order p. So the assumptions are:\n\n- p is a prime.\n- The field has p elements.\n- a is a non-zero element of the field.\n\nEach of these is a separate assumption. The problem then is to prove that x^p - x + a is irreducible over this field. \n\nI need to make sure that each assumption is only addressing one property. For example, \"p is a prime\" is one line. Then \"The field has p elements\" is another. Then \"a ≠ 0 in the field\" as the third. \n\nThe problem statement is as given, but restructured to fit the format. The user had already mentioned proving no roots and separable, but the task is to show irreducibility. So the problem part would just be the main question.",
