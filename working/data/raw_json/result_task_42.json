    "Content":"I know some nice ways to prove that $\\zeta(2) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\pi^2\/6$.  For example, see Robin Chapman's list or the answers to the question \" Different methods to compute $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2}$ ?\" Are there any nice ways to prove that $$\\zeta(4) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^4} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{90}?$$ I already know some proofs that give all values of $\\zeta(n)$ for positive even integers $n$ (like #7 on Robin Chapman's list or Qiaochu Yuan's answer in the linked question).  I'm not so much interested in those kinds of proofs as I am those that are specifically for $\\zeta(4)$. I would be particularly interested in a proof that isn't an adaption of one that $\\zeta(2) = \\pi^2\/6$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to structure this problem according to the user's format. The original question is about proving that ζ(4) equals π⁴\/90. The user wants the assumptions and the problem clearly separated.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the assumptions. The problem is about the Riemann zeta function at 4, so the first assumption should be that ζ(s) is defined as the sum of 1\/n^s from n=1 to infinity. Then, the specific case where s=4. Also, the problem is looking for a proof specifically for ζ(4), not general even integers, so maybe another assumption is that the proof should not be a general method applicable to all even integers. Wait, but in the example given, the assumptions were about the properties of the objects involved, not about the proof method. The user example had assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". So here, maybe the assumptions should relate to the definition of ζ(4) and any conditions mentioned.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"Prove that ζ(4) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴ = π⁴\/90\". The key elements are the series representation of ζ(4) and the equality to π⁴\/90. So the assumptions would include that ζ(4) is defined by that infinite series. Also, the problem mentions that the proof shouldn't be an adaption of the one for ζ(2) and shouldn't be a general proof for all even integers. However, in the example provided, assumptions were about the problem's conditions, not about the proof method. The user's example had assumptions related to the problem's variables, not the method of proof. Therefore, perhaps the assumptions here are just the mathematical definitions. The part about the proof not being an adaption might be part of the problem statement, not an assumption. \n\nSo, structuring the assumptions: \n\n1. ζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1\/n^s.\n2. The problem considers the case where s=4.\n\nThen the problem is to prove that this sum equals π⁴\/90, with the additional condition that the proof isn't an adaption of the ζ(2) proof and isn't a general even integer proof. But how to phrase that in the problem statement? The original example's problem line included the divisibility condition as part of the problem. So here, the problem would be \"Prove that ζ(4) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴ = π⁴\/90 using a method specifically for ζ(4) and not an adaption of proofs for ζ(2) or general even integers.\" But maybe the user wants the problem line to be concise, and the conditions about the proof method are part of the problem's constraints. So the problem line would include those requirements. However, in the example given, the problem line was just the mathematical statement. The assumptions were about the variables. The example's original problem had an extra condition (divisible by 7) in the assumptions, but here, the question is about the proof method. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. \n\nWait, in the example, the original problem was to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. But the formatted assumption included that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. However, the original problem didn't mention n being divisible by 7; that seems like an error. Wait, looking back: the original example says \"Prove that for every integer n, the number A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" Then the formatted assumption lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" Wait, that doesn't match. The original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem's assumption includes \"n is divisible by 7\". That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was incorrect, but the user provided it as their own example. So perhaps in the user's example, they filtered out unrelated info and structured the problem with the necessary assumptions, even if the original problem didn't state them. So maybe in the example, the user added the assumption that n is divisible by 7, perhaps from the context. Wait, but 91 is 7×13, so maybe the original problem required divisibility by 91, and the assumptions are that n is an integer and maybe under the condition that n is divisible by 7 and 13? But the example's formatted problem lists \"n is an integer, n is divisible by 7.\" That seems conflicting. Perhaps the example was a mistake. \n\nBut regardless, following the user's instruction, the task is to filter the Math Stack Exchange question into assumptions and problem. The original question is about proving ζ(4) = π⁴\/90 with specific proofs not being adaptations of ζ(2) or general even integer proofs. So the assumptions here would be the mathematical definitions. The problem would be to prove the equality under the constraints about the proof method. However, the user's example's assumptions were about the variables in the problem, not about the method. So perhaps the assumptions here are:\n\n- ζ(4) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1\/n⁴.\n- The proof is specifically for ζ(4), not a general case for even integers.\n- The proof should not be an adaptation of proofs used for ζ(2).\n\nBut in the example, assumptions were about the problem's variables, not the proof's method. So maybe the assumptions should only include the mathematical definitions and conditions on the variables, while the constraints on the proof method are part of the problem statement. Therefore, the problem line would be: \"Prove that ζ(4) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴ = π⁴\/90 using a method specifically for ζ(4), not an adaption of proofs for ζ(2) or general even integers.\"\n\nBut I need to check the user's example again. In their example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted assumptions were that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. But the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so why is n assumed to be divisible by 7? That seems like a mistake. Unless the original problem had a typo and the formatted version corrected it. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is incorrect, but we need to follow their structure regardless.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- ζ(s) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1\/n^s.\n- s is a positive even integer.\n- The problem considers the case s=4.\n\nBut the original question says they already know proofs for general even integers and are not interested in those. So maybe the assumption is that the proof must be specific to s=4. However, in the user's example, assumptions are about the problem's variables, not the proof method. So perhaps the assumptions here are just the mathematical definitions. Therefore:\n\nAssumptions:\n- ζ(4) is defined as ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴.\n- The problem is to prove ζ(4) = π⁴\/90.\n\nBut the original question adds constraints on the proof method. Since the example included an assumption that wasn't in the original problem (n divisible by 7), perhaps here the assumptions should include that the proof is specific to ζ(4) and not an adaptation of ζ(2) proofs. But that's about the method, not the problem's conditions. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the user's example was wrong, but we have to proceed as per their instructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are only about the mathematical objects, not about the proof's nature. So the only assumptions would be the definition of ζ(4). Then the problem is to prove it equals π⁴\/90, with the additional context that the proof should be specific and not an adaptation, which would be part of the problem statement. So:\n\nAssumption:\nζ(4) is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1\/n⁴.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ζ(4) = π⁴\/90 using a method specifically for ζ(4), not an adaption of proofs for ζ(2) or general even integers.\n\nBut in the example, the problem line was concise, just stating the mathematical problem. So maybe the problem line is just \"Prove that ζ(4) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴ = π⁴\/90\" and the constraints about the proof method are part of the context but not the problem statement. However, the user's instructions say to structure the problem as per the format, which in the example included adding an assumption that wasn't in the original problem. So perhaps here, the problem is to be restated with the necessary assumptions and the problem statement. \n\nWait, the user says: \"filter the unrelated information and structure that problem as the following format.\" So the original question on Math Exchange might have extra information that's not directly the problem. In the example, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91, and the formatted problem included an assumption that n is divisible by 7. But 91 is 7*13, so perhaps the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by both 7 and 13, but it wasn't stated? Or maybe the example was incorrect.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to list the mathematical assumptions necessary for the problem and state the problem clearly. In this case, the key assumption is that ζ(4) is defined by the given series. The problem is to prove the equality to π⁴\/90, with the constraints on the proof method mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nSo, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption:\nζ(4) is defined as ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ζ(4) = π⁴\/90 using a method specifically for ζ(4), not applicable to ζ(2) or general even integers.\n\nBut according to the user's example, the problem line is just the mathematical statement. The example's problem line was \"Prove that A(n) = ... is divisible by 91.\" The additional context about the proof not being an adaptation was part of the original question but wasn't included in the formatted problem. So perhaps the user wants only the core mathematical problem in the problem line, and the assumptions are the mathematical conditions. The constraints on the proof method are part of the original question but are not part of the formatted problem. Therefore, the formatted problem should have:\n\nAssumption:\nζ(4) is defined as ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ζ(4) = π⁴\/90.\n\nBut the original question specifies that the user wants proofs specifically for ζ(4), not general even integers or adaptations of ζ(2). Should that be part of the problem statement? In the example, the original problem's assumptions were modified. Maybe the key is to extract the mathematical assumptions from the problem, not the proof constraints. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\nAssumption:\nThe Riemann zeta function at 4 is defined as the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1\/n⁴.\n\nProblem:\nProve that ζ(4) = π⁴\/90.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. The assumptions should list all conditions. Since the problem is about ζ(4), the definition is the main assumption. The problem is to prove the equality. The rest of the context (proof method constraints) are part of the original question's requirements but not part of the formatted problem's structure. So following the example, where the formatted problem didn't include the method constraints but focused on the mathematical statement, here too the problem line would be the mathematical statement, and the assumptions are the definitions. Therefore, the final answer would be:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nζ(4) is defined as $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^4}$.\nProblem: \nProve that $$\\zeta(4) = \\frac{\\pi^4}{90}.$$\n###",
