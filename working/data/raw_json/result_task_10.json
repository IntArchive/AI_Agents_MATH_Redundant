    "AcceptedAnswer":"These answers require way too much machinery. By definition, the characteristic polynomial of an $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ is given by \n$$p(t) = \\det(A-tI) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) \\,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big)\\,.$$\nOn the other hand, $p(t) = (-1)^n(t-\\lambda_1)\\dots (t-\\lambda_n)$, where the $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. So, comparing coefficients,  we have $\\text{tr}A = \\lambda_1 + \\dots + \\lambda_n$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows how assumptions and the problem should be separated. \n\nFirst, I need to read the original problem carefully. The question is about proving that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. The user mentioned that existing proofs are too obscure, so they want a simple one.\n\nNow, according to the format, I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. Then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original question, the key elements are:\n- The matrix in question (but the problem is general, not a specific matrix).\n- The trace of a matrix.\n- The eigenvalues of that matrix.\n\nBut wait, the original problem as stated doesn't mention any specific conditions on the matrix. However, in linear algebra, the trace being the sum of eigenvalues typically applies to square matrices, and depending on the field, perhaps complex matrices to ensure all eigenvalues exist. But sometimes it's stated for matrices over an algebraically closed field, or assuming that the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors.\n\nSo the assumptions would include that the matrix is square, and maybe that it's over a field where eigenvalues exist (like complex numbers). But the original problem doesn't specify these; maybe the user assumes the reader knows that. However, in the example given earlier, assumptions were made explicit even if they weren't in the original problem. For instance, in the example, the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was added, which wasn't in the original problem's statement. Wait, no, looking back, the original problem was to prove for every integer n, the expression is divisible by 91. The formatted problem added an assumption that n is divisible by 7. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the example formatted problem lists \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as assumptions, but that contradicts the original problem's statement. Hmm, perhaps the example was a mistake? Because the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds \"n is divisible by 7\" as an assumption, which would restrict n. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the example is a different problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example's original problem is: Prove that for every integer n, A(n) is divisible by 91. The formatted problem lists assumptions: n is an integer, n is divisible by 7. But that would mean the problem is to prove A(n) is divisible by 91 under the assumption that n is divisible by 7, which changes the original problem. That seems like an error in the example. But maybe the example is correct because the user's instruction says \"filtered the unrelated informations\". Wait, perhaps the original problem had some extra conditions, but the user restructured it to clarify the assumptions. Maybe the original problem had a condition that n is divisible by 7, but the way it was written was unclear, and the example extracted that. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed carefully.\n\nIn any case, for the current problem, the original question is to prove that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. The standard proof of this involves the fact that the trace is the sum of the diagonal entries and that the sum of eigenvalues is the trace, which comes from the characteristic polynomial. However, this requires that the matrix is square and that the eigenvalues exist (which in complex matrices they do). So the assumptions would be:\n\n1. The matrix is a square matrix.\n2. The matrix is defined over a field where its characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors (e.g., the field is algebraically closed, like the complex numbers).\n\nBut the original problem doesn't specify these; it's possible that the user assumes the matrix is square and over the complex numbers. Therefore, the assumptions should list these conditions.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the assumption added a condition (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem. That suggests that maybe in this case, the problem's original statement might have had missing assumptions that the answerer needs to clarify. However, in the given problem here, the user's question is very general, just asking for a proof that trace equals sum of eigenvalues. So perhaps the answerer needs to list the necessary assumptions for that to hold.\n\nTherefore, structuring the problem:\n\nAssumption:\nThe matrix is a square matrix,\nThe matrix is defined over an algebraically closed field.\n\nProblem:\nProve that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is diagonalizable? But no, the trace-sum of eigenvalues holds even if the matrix isn't diagonalizable, as long as eigenvalues exist (with algebraic multiplicities). So the key assumptions are that it's a square matrix over a field where the characteristic polynomial splits (like complex numbers).\n\nHence, the formatted problem would have those two assumptions.",
