detailed_proof:  We will prove that n divides φ(2^n - 1) for any positive integer n with 2^n - 1 > 1.

**Step 1: Show gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1**
Since 2^n - 1 is odd for any positive integer n (as 2^n is even for n ≥ 1, so 2^n - 1 is odd), and 2 is even, the only common divisor could be 1. More formally, any common divisor d of 2 and 2^n - 1 must divide any linear combination of them. In particular, d divides (2^n - 1) - 2·(2^{n-1} - 1) = 1. Therefore, d = 1, establishing gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1.

**Step 2: Define the multiplicative order**
Let d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2^n - 1. By definition, d is the smallest positive integer such that 2^d ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). The existence of such d is guaranteed because gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1 from Step 1.

**Step 3: Prove d = n**
First, note that 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1) because 2^n - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 2^n - 1), so 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). This shows that n is a positive integer satisfying 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1).

Now we need to show that n is the smallest such positive integer. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a positive integer d < n such that 2^d ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). Then 2^n - 1 divides 2^d - 1. But for d < n, we have 2^d - 1 < 2^n - 1 (since the function f(x) = 2^x - 1 is strictly increasing for x > 0). The only way a positive integer (2^n - 1) can divide a smaller positive integer (2^d - 1) is if 2^d - 1 = 0, which would imply d = 0, contradicting d being a positive integer. Therefore, no such d < n exists, and n is indeed the smallest positive integer with 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1). Hence, d = n.

**Step 4: Apply Euler's theorem**
Since gcd(2, 2^n - 1) = 1 (from Step 1), Euler's theorem applies, giving us:
2^{φ(2^n - 1)} ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1)
where φ is Euler's totient function.

**Step 5: Relate the multiplicative order to φ(2^n - 1)**
A fundamental property of multiplicative orders states that if a^k ≡ 1 (mod m) and d is the multiplicative order of a modulo m, then d divides k. Applying this with a = 2, m = 2^n - 1, and k = φ(2^n - 1), we have:
Since 2^{φ(2^n - 1)} ≡ 1 (mod 2^n - 1) (from Step 4) and d = n is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2^n - 1 (from Step 3), it follows that n divides φ(2^n - 1).

**Step 6: Conclusion**
Therefore, we have shown that n divides φ(2^n - 1) for any positive integer n with 2^n - 1 > 1. This completes the proof.

**Remark:** The condition 2^n - 1 > 1 ensures we avoid the trivial case n = 1 where 2^1 - 1 = 1 and φ(1) = 1, and while 1 divides 1, the proof above requires 2^n - 1 to have a well-defined multiplicative order (which it does even for m = 1, but the statement is still true for n = 1).

detailed_proof:  We are given: $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x$, where $f^{-1}(x)$ denotes a function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Let $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Then by definition, $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Step 1: Prove $f$ is injective.**
Assume $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. We need to show $a = b$.

From the given equation: $f(a) + g(a) = a$ and $f(b) + g(b) = b$.
Since $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:
$g(a) = a - f(a)$ and $g(b) = b - f(b) = b - f(a)$.

Now apply $f$ to both $g(a)$ and $g(b)$:
$f(g(a)) = a$ (by definition of $g$)
$f(g(b)) = b$ (by definition of $g$)

If we can show $g(a) = g(b)$, then $f(g(a)) = f(g(b))$ implies $a = b$.

From $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:
$g(a) = a - f(a)$ and $g(b) = b - f(a)$.
We need to show $a - f(a) = b - f(a)$, which would imply $a = b$.

Consider applying $f$ to $g(a)$ and $g(b)$ differently. Since $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$, if $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$.

Alternatively, we can use the given equation more directly. Since $f(a) = f(b)$, we have:
$a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.
Thus $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.

Now consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. If $g(a) \neq g(b)$, then $f$ would map two different inputs to different outputs, which doesn't contradict injectivity. We need a different approach.

Let's use the fact that $g$ is defined by $f(g(x)) = x$. Since $f(a) = f(b)$, let $y = f(a) = f(b)$. Then:
$f(a) = y \Rightarrow a = f(a) + g(a) = y + g(a)$
$f(b) = y \Rightarrow b = f(b) + g(b) = y + g(b)$

Now apply $f$ to $g(a)$ and $g(b)$:
$f(g(a)) = a = y + g(a)$
$f(g(b)) = b = y + g(b)$

But also, by definition of $g$, we have $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. This is consistent.

Consider the composition: $f(g(f(a))) = f(a) = y$. But also $f(g(f(a))) = f(a) + g(f(a))$ by applying the given equation to $f(a)$ instead of $a$.
Wait, the given equation is $f(x) + g(x) = x$ for all $x$. So for $x = f(a)$, we have:
$f(f(a)) + g(f(a)) = f(a) = y$.

This doesn't directly help. Let's try a cleaner approach:

Assume $f(a) = f(b)$. We want to show $a = b$.
From the given: $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(b) + g(b) = f(a) + g(b)$.
So $a - b = g(a) - g(b)$.

Now consider $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$.
If $g(a) = g(b)$, then $a = b$ and we're done.
If $g(a) \neq g(b)$, then $f$ maps $g(a)$ to $a$ and $g(b)$ to $b$.
But we also have $f(a) = f(b)$. So $f$ maps $a$ and $b$ to the same value $y$.

Consider applying $g$ to $y$: $g(y) = y - f(y)$ by the given equation.
But $f(g(y)) = y$ by definition.

Actually, let's prove injectivity by contradiction. Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ but $a \neq b$.
Then $a = f(a) + g(a)$ and $b = f(a) + g(b)$, so $a - b = g(a) - g(b) \neq 0$.
Thus $g(a) \neq g(b)$.

Now $f(g(a)) = a$ and $f(g(b)) = b$. Since $a \neq b$, we have $f(g(a)) \neq f(g(b))$.
But $g(a) \neq g(b)$, so this doesn't give a contradiction.

Wait, we need to use the fact that $g$ itself satisfies a similar property. From $f(g(x)) = x$, we can apply the given equation to $g(x)$:
$f(g(x)) + g(g(x)) = g(x)$ for all $x$.
But $f(g(x)) = x$, so $x + g(g(x)) = g(x)$, or $g(g(x)) = g(x) - x$.

This might help. Let's continue with surjectivity first and see if that helps with injectivity.

**Step 2: Prove $f$ is surjective.**
For any $y \in \mathbb{R}$, we need to find $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$.

Consider $x = y + g(y)$. Then:
$f(x) = f(y + g(y))$.
We need to show this equals $y$.

From the given equation applied to $y$: $f(y) + g(y) = y$, so $g(y) = y - f(y)$.
Thus $x = y + (y - f(y)) = 2y - f(y)$.

This doesn't seem to directly give $f(x) = y$. Let's try a different approach.

Take $x = g(y)$. Then $f(x) = f(g(y)) = y$ by definition of $g$.
So for any $y \in \mathbb{R}$, $x = g(y)$ satisfies $f(x) = y$.
Thus $f$ is surjective!

**Step 3: Now prove $f$ is injective using surjectivity.**
We know $f$ is surjective. Assume $f(a) = f(b)$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exist $u, v \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a = g(u)$ and $b = g(v)$.
Then $f(g(u)) = u$ and $f(g(v)) = v$.
But $f(g(u)) = f(a) = f(b) = f(g(v))$, so $u = v$.
Thus $a = g(u) = g(v) = b$.
Therefore $f$ is injective.

**Step 4: Conclusion.**
Since $f$ is both injective and surjective, $f$ is bijective.

**Step 5: Verification.**
Now that we've proven $f$ is bijective, the inverse function $f^{-1}$ exists properly and satisfies $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The given equation $f(x) + f^{-1}(x) = x$ holds with this properly defined inverse, completing the proof.

Thus, under the given assumptions, $f$ is bijective.

detailed_proof:  We will prove by contradiction that if all edges in a connected graph G have distinct weights, then G has a unique minimum spanning tree.

**Proof:**

1. **Assumptions:** Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph with weight function w: E → ℝ such that all edge weights are distinct. That is, for any two distinct edges e₁, e₂ ∈ E, we have w(e₁) ≠ w(e₂).

2. **Assume for contradiction:** Suppose G has two different minimum spanning trees T₁ and T₂. Since T₁ ≠ T₂, there exists at least one edge that is in T₁ but not in T₂, and vice versa.

3. **Consider the symmetric difference:** Let S = (T₁ \ T₂) ∪ (T₂ \ T₁) be the set of edges that are in exactly one of T₁ or T₂. Since T₁ and T₂ are different, S is non-empty.

4. **Choose edge e:** Let e be an edge in S with minimum weight among all edges in S. Without loss of generality, assume e ∈ T₁ \ T₂ (if e ∈ T₂ \ T₁, we can swap the roles of T₁ and T₂ in the argument).

5. **Add e to T₂:** Consider adding edge e to T₂. Since T₂ is a spanning tree (and thus contains exactly |V| - 1 edges), adding e creates a unique cycle C in T₂ ∪ {e}. This cycle must contain e because T₂ itself is acyclic.

6. **Existence of edge f:** Since e ∉ T₂, the cycle C must contain at least one edge f ≠ e that is in T₂ but not in T₁. Here's why:
   - All edges in C except e are in T₂.
   - If every edge in C (other than e) were also in T₁, then T₁ would contain the cycle C, contradicting that T₁ is a tree (acyclic).
   - Therefore, there exists at least one edge f ∈ C, f ≠ e, such that f ∈ T₂ but f ∉ T₁.

7. **Weight comparison:** Since all edge weights are distinct, we have either w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f).

8. **Case 1: w(e) < w(f):**
   Consider the spanning tree T₂' obtained from T₂ by removing edge f and adding edge e. Formally, T₂' = (T₂ \ {f}) ∪ {e}.
   - T₂' is still a spanning tree: Removing f breaks the cycle C, and adding e reconnects the graph without creating cycles.
   - The weight of T₂' is w(T₂') = w(T₂) - w(f) + w(e).
   - Since w(e) < w(f), we have w(T₂') < w(T₂).
   - This contradicts the assumption that T₂ is a minimum spanning tree (which should have minimum possible weight among all spanning trees).

9. **Case 2: w(e) > w(f):**
   In this case, note that f ∈ T₂ \ T₁ and w(f) < w(e). Since e was chosen as the minimum weight edge in S, and f ∈ S (because f ∈ T₂ \ T₁), we must have w(f) ≥ w(e) (by definition of e as the minimum weight edge in S). This contradicts w(f) < w(e).
   
   Alternatively, we can apply a symmetric argument: Consider adding f to T₁. Since f ∉ T₁, adding f to T₁ creates a cycle C' in T₁ ∪ {f}. This cycle must contain an edge e' ≠ f that is in T₁ but not in T₂. Since w(f) < w(e) and e was the minimum weight edge in S, we have w(f) < w(e'). Then replacing e' with f in T₁ would give a spanning tree with weight less than T₁, contradicting that T₁ is an MST.

10. **Conclusion:** In both possible cases (w(e) < w(f) or w(e) > w(f)), we reach a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that there exist two different minimum spanning trees T₁ and T₂ must be false. Hence, the minimum spanning tree of G is unique.

proof_sketch:  Step 1) Identify K = ℚ(√-19) as a quadratic extension of ℚ, which is finite (degree 2).
Step 2) For quadratic fields ℚ(√d) with d squarefree, the ring of integers depends on d mod 4.
Step 3) Since -19 ≡ 1 mod 4, the expected ring of integers is ℤ[(1+√-19)/2].
Step 4) Show elements of R are integral over ℤ: For α = a + b(1+√-19)/2 ∈ R, compute minimal polynomial and verify integer coefficients.
Step 5) Show all integral elements of K are in R: For α = x + y√-19 ∈ K integral over ℤ, derive conditions on x,y that imply α ∈ R.
Step 6) Conclude R is the integral closure of ℤ in K, hence the ring of integers of the finite extension K/ℚ.

detailed_proof:  We prove that $R = \mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$ is the ring of integers of the quadratic field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-19})$, which is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2.

**Step 1: Identify the field extension**
Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-19})$. This is a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ since $\sqrt{-19}$ satisfies the irreducible polynomial $x^2 + 19 = 0$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The extension degree $[K:\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, so $K$ is indeed a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Step 2: Recall general theory for quadratic fields**
For a quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a squarefree integer (not divisible by any perfect square other than 1), the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ (the integral closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $K$) is:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{O}_K &= \mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right] \quad \text{if } d \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
\mathcal{O}_K &= \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}] \quad \text{if } d \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}
\end{align*}

**Step 3: Check conditions for $d = -19$**
First, $-19$ is squarefree: it is a prime number (in absolute value) and not divisible by any perfect square. Second, we check $d \mod 4$:
$$-19 = -20 + 1 = 4(-5) + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$$
Thus by the general theory, we expect $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right] = R$.

**Step 4: Show $R \subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ (elements of $R$ are integral over $\mathbb{Z}$)**
Let $\alpha = a + b\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right) \in R$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. We compute:
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= a + \frac{b}{2} + \frac{b}{2}\sqrt{-19} \\
&= \left(a + \frac{b}{2}\right) + \frac{b}{2}\sqrt{-19}
\end{align*}
Let $u = a + \frac{b}{2}$ and $v = \frac{b}{2}$. Then $\alpha = u + v\sqrt{-19}$.

The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is:
$$f(x) = x^2 - \operatorname{Tr}(\alpha)x + \operatorname{N}(\alpha)$$
where $\operatorname{Tr}(\alpha) = \alpha + \overline{\alpha} = 2u$ and $\operatorname{N}(\alpha) = \alpha\overline{\alpha} = u^2 + 19v^2$.

Substituting $u = a + \frac{b}{2}$ and $v = \frac{b}{2}$:
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{Tr}(\alpha) &= 2\left(a + \frac{b}{2}\right) = 2a + b \in \mathbb{Z} \\
\operatorname{N}(\alpha) &= \left(a + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2 + 19\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 \\
&= a^2 + ab + \frac{b^2}{4} + \frac{19b^2}{4} \\
&= a^2 + ab + \frac{20b^2}{4} \\
&= a^2 + ab + 5b^2 \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}
Thus $f(x) = x^2 - (2a+b)x + (a^2+ab+5b^2)$ has integer coefficients, so $\alpha$ is integral over $\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore $R \subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$.

**Step 5: Show $\mathcal{O}_K \subseteq R$ (all integral elements of $K$ are in $R$)**
Let $\beta = x + y\sqrt{-19} \in K$ be integral over $\mathbb{Z}$, where $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}$. Since $\beta$ is integral, its trace and norm are integers:
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{Tr}(\beta) &= 2x \in \mathbb{Z} \\
\operatorname{N}(\beta) &= x^2 + 19y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}
From $2x \in \mathbb{Z}$, let $2x = m \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $x = m/2$.

From $x^2 + 19y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$, substitute $x = m/2$:
$$\frac{m^2}{4} + 19y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$$
Multiply by 4:
$$m^2 + 76y^2 \in 4\mathbb{Z}$$
Thus $76y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ (since $m^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$), so $76y^2 = n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Let $y = p/q$ in lowest terms with $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$, $q > 0$, $\gcd(p,q) = 1$. Then:
$$76\frac{p^2}{q^2} = n \in \mathbb{Z}$$
So $q^2 \mid 76p^2$. Since $\gcd(p,q) = 1$, we have $\gcd(p^2, q^2) = 1$, so $q^2 \mid 76 = 2^2 \cdot 19$.
Thus $q \mid 2\sqrt{19}$, but since $q \in \mathbb{Z}$, $q$ must divide $2$ (as $\sqrt{19}$ is irrational). So $q = 1$ or $q = 2$.

**Case 1: $q = 1$**
Then $y = p \in \mathbb{Z}$. From $x^2 + 19y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $x = m/2$, we have:
$$\frac{m^2}{4} + 19p^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$$
Thus $m^2/4 \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $4 \mid m^2$, hence $2 \mid m$. Let $m = 2k$, then $x = k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Then $\beta = k + p\sqrt{-19} = (2k-p) + 2p\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right) \in R$.

**Case 2: $q = 2$**
Then $y = p/2$ with $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. From $x^2 + 19y^2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $x = m/2$:
$$\frac{m^2}{4} + 19\frac{p^2}{4} = \frac{m^2 + 19p^2}{4} \in \mathbb{Z}$$
Thus $4 \mid (m^2 + 19p^2)$. Since $19 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, we have $m^2 + 19p^2 \equiv m^2 + 3p^2 \pmod{4}$.

Checking squares mod 4: $0^2 \equiv 0$, $1^2 \equiv 1$, $2^2 \equiv 0$, $3^2 \equiv 1$. So $m^2, p^2 \in \{0,1\} \pmod{4}$.
For $m^2 + 3p^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$, we need:
- If $p^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$, then $m^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$
- If $p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, then $m^2 + 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$, so $m^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$

In either case, $m^2 \equiv p^2 \pmod{4}$, so $m \equiv p \pmod{2}$.

Now write $\beta = x + y\sqrt{-19} = \frac{m}{2} + \frac{p}{2}\sqrt{-19} = \frac{m-p}{2} + p\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right)$.
Since $m \equiv p \pmod{2}$, $(m-p)/2 \in \mathbb{Z}$, so $\beta \in R$.

In both cases, $\beta \in R$. Therefore $\mathcal{O}_K \subseteq R$.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
We have shown $R \subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ and $\mathcal{O}_K \subseteq R$, so $R = \mathcal{O}_K$. Since $\mathcal{O}_K$ is by definition the ring of integers of $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-19})$, and $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ (degree 2), we conclude that $R = \mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$ is indeed the ring of integers of a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$.
