proof_sketch:  Step 1) Recall the definition of an odd number: A number m is odd if and only if there exists an integer k such that m = 2k + 1.
Step 2) From the definition, note that 2k + 1 is an expression involving integers (2, k, and 1).
Step 3) Since k is an integer (by definition), and the sum/product of integers is an integer, m = 2k + 1 must be an integer.
Step 4) Therefore, if m is odd, then m is an integer.

detailed_proof:  We are given that m is odd. By definition, a number m is odd if and only if there exists an integer k such that m = 2k + 1.

Let k be such an integer (which exists by the definition of m being odd).

Now, consider the expression 2k + 1:
1. Since k is an integer, 2k is the product of the integer 2 and the integer k.
2. The product of two integers is always an integer, so 2k is an integer.
3. Adding 1 (which is an integer) to 2k gives 2k + 1.
4. The sum of two integers is always an integer, so 2k + 1 is an integer.

Since m = 2k + 1 and 2k + 1 is an integer, we conclude that m is an integer.

Therefore, if m is odd, then m must be an integer. This completes the proof.

proof_sketch:  Step 1) Recall the definition of Lagrange constant: L(α) = sup{c > 0: |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p/q}
Step 2) Interpret the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²): For fixed c, this gives a quality measure of rational approximations - smaller c means the bound is looser (worse approximation quality required)
Step 3) Note that L(α) being larger means there exists a larger c such that infinitely many good approximations exist (with error < 1/(c q²))
Step 4) Conversely, if L(α) is smaller, then for larger values of c, the inequality has only finitely many solutions - meaning α has fewer high-quality approximations
Step 5) Formal comparison: If L(α) < L(β), then for any c with L(α) < c < L(β), α has only finitely many approximations satisfying |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²), while β has infinitely many such approximations
Step 6) Conclude: α being 'more irrational' (L(α) < L(β)) means β has infinitely many approximations of quality 1/(c q²) for some c where α has only finitely many - thus α is harder to approximate well by rationals

detailed_proof:  We will prove that the definition of 'more irrational' based on Lagrange constants corresponds precisely to the intuitive notion of how poorly a number can be approximated by rational numbers.

**Step 1: Understanding the Lagrange constant definition**
For an irrational number α, the Lagrange constant L(α) is defined as:
L(α) = sup{c > 0: |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p/q}

This definition captures the 'best possible' constant c in the approximation inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²). A larger L(α) means there exists a larger c such that infinitely many rational approximations p/q satisfy the inequality.

**Step 2: Interpreting the approximation inequality**
Consider the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²). For fixed c, this inequality gives a measure of approximation quality:
- Smaller values of the right-hand side 1/(c q²) mean the approximation must be more accurate
- Larger c makes 1/(c q²) smaller, requiring better approximations
- Smaller c makes 1/(c q²) larger, allowing worse approximations

Thus, the inequality with larger c represents a stricter (higher quality) approximation requirement.

**Step 3: Relating L(α) to approximation quality**
If L(α) is large, then for many large values of c, there exist infinitely many rational approximations p/q satisfying |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²). This means α has many high-quality approximations.

Conversely, if L(α) is small, then for most large values of c, the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has only finitely many solutions. This means α has relatively few high-quality approximations.

**Step 4: Formal comparison of two numbers**
Let α and β be irrational numbers with L(α) < L(β). Choose any c such that L(α) < c < L(β). By definition of supremum:
1. Since c > L(α), the inequality |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has only finitely many rational solutions p/q.
2. Since c < L(β), the inequality |β - p/q| < 1/(c q²) has infinitely many rational solutions p/q.

This shows that for the approximation quality threshold 1/(c q²), β has infinitely many approximations while α has only finitely many.

**Step 5: Extending to all approximation qualities**
More generally, for any approximation quality threshold ε > 0, we can consider the inequality |α - p/q| < ε/q². This is equivalent to |α - p/q| < 1/(c q²) where c = 1/ε.

If L(α) < L(β), then for sufficiently small ε (equivalently, sufficiently large c = 1/ε with c > L(α)), α will have only finitely many approximations satisfying |α - p/q| < ε/q², while β will have infinitely many such approximations.

**Step 6: Connecting to intuitive notion of 'more irrational'**
The intuitive concept of 'more irrational' means that a number is harder to approximate well by rational numbers. Our analysis shows:
- When L(α) < L(β), there exists an approximation quality threshold such that β has infinitely many approximations at that quality while α has only finitely many
- This means β admits better rational approximations than α
- Equivalently, α is harder to approximate well by rationals than β
- Therefore, α is 'more irrational' than β

**Conclusion:** The definition that α is 'more irrational' than β if L(α) < L(β) precisely captures the intuitive notion that α is harder to approximate well by rational numbers than β. The Lagrange constant L(α) measures the supremum of constants c for which high-quality approximations exist, so a smaller Lagrange constant indicates poorer approximation properties, which corresponds to being 'more irrational'.

proof_sketch:  Step 1) Let A be an m×n matrix, P be a p×q matrix, and B be an r×s matrix.
Step 2) Since P is invertible, it must be square (p = q) and have an inverse P⁻¹ of size p×p.
Step 3) For the product P⁻¹A to be defined, the number of columns of P⁻¹ (which is p) must equal the number of rows of A (which is m). Thus m = p.
Step 4) For the product (P⁻¹A)P to be defined, the number of columns of P⁻¹A (which is n) must equal the number of rows of P (which is p). Thus n = p.
Step 5) From steps 3 and 4, we have m = p and n = p, so m = n = p. Therefore A is an n×n matrix.
Step 6) Since B = P⁻¹AP and all matrices on the right are n×n, B must also be n×n. Thus A and B are both n×n matrices.

detailed_proof:  We are given that A and B are matrices with real or complex entries, and there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^{-1}AP. We need to prove that A and B are square matrices of the same size.

Let us denote the dimensions of the matrices as follows:
- Let A be an m × n matrix (m rows, n columns)
- Let P be a p × q matrix (p rows, q columns)
- Let B be an r × s matrix (r rows, s columns)

We will analyze the dimensions step by step:

1. **Invertibility of P implies P is square:** Since P is invertible, it must be a square matrix. This means p = q, and P^{-1} exists and is also a p × p matrix.

2. **Compatibility of P^{-1}A:** For the matrix product P^{-1}A to be defined, the number of columns of P^{-1} must equal the number of rows of A. Since P^{-1} is p × p, it has p columns. Matrix A has m rows. Therefore, we must have p = m.

3. **Compatibility of (P^{-1}A)P:** The product P^{-1}A results in a matrix whose dimensions are determined by the outer dimensions: P^{-1} is p × p and A is m × n, so P^{-1}A is p × n (since p = m from step 2). For the product (P^{-1}A)P to be defined, the number of columns of P^{-1}A must equal the number of rows of P. P^{-1}A has n columns, and P has p rows. Therefore, we must have n = p.

4. **Deduction of dimensions:** From step 2, we have m = p. From step 3, we have n = p. Therefore, m = n = p. This means:
   - A is an n × n matrix (since m = n)
   - P is an n × n matrix (since p = n)
   - P^{-1} is also n × n

5. **Dimension of B:** Since B = P^{-1}AP, and all matrices on the right-hand side are n × n, the product P^{-1}AP is also an n × n matrix. Therefore, B is an n × n matrix.

6. **Conclusion:** We have shown that A and B are both n × n matrices. Moreover, they are square matrices of the same size n × n.

Thus, given that B = P^{-1}AP with P invertible, it necessarily follows that A and B are square matrices of the same dimension.
