    "Content":"Define a function $f(\\alpha, \\beta)$, $\\alpha \\in (-1,1)$, $\\beta \\in (-1,1)$ as $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}$$ One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem to show that $$ f(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\pi \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha \\beta\\right )}}{ \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\alpha\\right )} \\,  \\sin{\\left (\\pi \\beta\\right )}} $$ Clearly, from this latter expression, $f(\\alpha, \\beta) = f(\\beta, \\alpha)$.  My question is, can one see this symmetry directly from the integral expression?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"I hope this answers your question. $$\\begin{align}\n \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} x^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathscr M\\circ\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\} dx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta-1}\\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n&= \\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\cdot\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\\,\\, dydx\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ Ideally, if $\\displaystyle{\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)}$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ , then we got what the OP wants. Surprisingly, $$\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}\\qquad(\\star)$$ which is obviously symmetric. The rest of the answer is devoted to the proof of $(\\star)$ . $$I:=\\frac1y \\mathscr M^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\\right\\}(y)\n=\\frac1{2\\pi iy}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{y^{-\\beta}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}}_{:= f(\\beta)}d\\beta$$ Let's look at the poles and residues of the integrand, so that this integral can be evaluated by residue theorem later. The poles are all simple, and are located at $$p_n^{\\pm}=\\pm\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{\\pi i}+1\\right)+2n:=\\pm c\\pm 1+2n\\qquad n\\in\\mathbb Z$$ Moreover, the residues are $$\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),\\beta=p_n^{\\pm})=\\pm\\frac{y^{\\mp c\\mp 1-2n}}{\\pi i(1-x^2)}$$ For $y>1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the right half plane. By residue theorem, $$\\begin{align}\nI &=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot -2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the right half plane} \\\\\n&=-\\frac1y\\left(\\sum^\\infty_{n=0}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{+})+\\sum^\\infty_{n=1}\\operatorname{Res}(f(\\beta),p_n^{-})\\right) \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)y}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-1}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c+1}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c-2}}{1-y^{-2}}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)}\\left[\\frac{y^{-c}}{y^{2}-1}+\\frac{y^{c}}{1-y^2}\\right] \\\\\n&=-\\frac1{\\pi i(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\left(e^{\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}-e^{-\\ln y\\ln x\/(\\pi i)}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ For $0<y<1$ , $f(\\beta)$ decays exponentially on the left half plane. By residue theorem, $$I=\\frac1{2\\pi i y}\\cdot 2\\pi i\\sum\\text{residue on the left half plane}$$ It is not a surprise that the sum is also equal to $\\displaystyle{\\frac2{\\pi(1-x^2)(1-y^2)}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}$ . This can be seen as an instance of analytic continuation, due to the removable singularity at $y=1$ . In conclusion, $$\\frac1{2\\pi i}\\int^{i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\frac{y^{-\\beta-1}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}d\\beta=\\frac2{\\pi}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}$$ $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} dx \\: \\frac{x^{\\alpha}}{1+2 x \\cos{(\\pi \\beta)} + x^2}\n= \\frac2{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} \\int^\\infty_0 x^{\\alpha}y^{\\beta}\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\ln x\\ln y}{\\pi}\\right)}{(x^2-1)(y^2-1)}dxdy$$",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, so I need to structure this problem according to the given format. Let me first read through the original question carefully.\n\nThe user defines a function f(α, β) where α and β are in (-1, 1). The function is an integral from 0 to infinity of x^α divided by (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx. They mention that using the Residue Theorem, they derived an expression involving sine functions, and from that expression, it's clear that f(α, β) = f(β, α). The question is whether one can see this symmetry directly from the integral expression without using the derived formula.\n\nNow, applying the format. The assumptions should list each condition applied to one object. Let's break it down:\n\n- The function f is defined with two variables, α and β.\n- α is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- β is in the interval (-1, 1).\n- The integral defining f is from 0 to infinity.\n- The integrand is x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²).\n\nThe problem is to show the symmetry f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral, not using the explicit formula derived via residues.\n\nWait, the original problem mentions \"One can use, for example, the Residue Theorem...\" but the answer is supposed to structure the problem, not the solution. So the assumptions are about the parameters and the integral. The problem is to see the symmetry from the integral expression.\n\nI need to check if all the conditions are covered. The variables α and β are each in (-1,1), the integral is from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is as given. The problem is to show f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral.\n\nSo the assumptions would be:\n\n- α is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- β is a real number in (-1, 1),\n- f(α, β) is defined as the integral from 0 to ∞ of x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx.\n\nProblem: Show that f(α, β) = f(β, α) directly from the integral expression.\n\nI think that's all. The original problem doesn't have any additional constraints beyond α and β being in (-1,1). The integral is definite from 0 to infinity, so that's part of the definition. The key point is to note the variables' domains and the integral's form. The problem is about symmetry between α and β in the integral expression.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nproof:\nProblem:\nLet α and β be real numbers in the interval (-1, 1). Let the function f(α, β) be defined by the integral:\nf(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx\nThe question is: Does f(α, β) equal (π sin(απβ)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ))?\n\nSolution:\nThe answer is no. The correct expression for the integral is different.\n\nWe can evaluate the integral using standard integral tables or by methods such as contour integration. The integral is a known form, often referred to as the Ramanujan integral. For the given constraints on α and β, the value of the integral is:\nf(α, β) = π sin(α(π - π|β|)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π|β|))\n\nLet's demonstrate the discrepancy with a specific case.\nLet α = 1\/2 and β = 1\/2. Both values are within the interval (-1, 1).\nAccording to the problem's proposed formula, the value would be:\nf(1\/2, 1\/2) = (π sin( (1\/2) * π * (1\/2) )) \/ (sin( (1\/2) * π ) * sin( (1\/2) * π ))\n= (π sin(π\/4)) \/ (sin(π\/2) * sin(π\/2))\n= (π * (√2\/2)) \/ (1 * 1)\n= π√2 \/ 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the integral directly for these values:\nf(1\/2, 1\/2) = ∫₀^∞ x^(1\/2) \/ (1 + 2x cos(π\/2) + x²) dx\n= ∫₀^∞ √x \/ (1 + 2x * 0 + x²) dx\n= ∫₀^∞ √x \/ (1 + x²) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution u = √x, which implies x = u² and dx = 2u du.\nThe integration limits remain from 0 to ∞.\nf(1\/2, 1\/2) = ∫₀^∞ u \/ (1 + (u²)²) * 2u du\n= 2 ∫₀^∞ u² \/ (1 + u⁴) du\n\nThis is a standard integral. Using the result ∫₀^∞ x^m \/ (1+x^n) dx = (π\/n) \/ sin((m+1)π\/n), with m=2 and n=4:\nf(1\/2, 1\/2) = 2 * [ (π\/4) \/ sin((2+1)π\/4) ]\n= 2 * [ (π\/4) \/ sin(3π\/4) ]\n= 2 * [ (π\/4) \/ (√2\/2) ]\n= 2 * (π\/4) * (2\/√2)\n= π\/√2\n= π√2 \/ 2\n\nIn this specific case (α=1\/2, β=1\/2), the proposed formula and the direct calculation yield the same result. Let's try another case where they differ.\n\nLet α = 1\/2 and β = -1\/2.\nAccording to the problem's proposed formula:\nf(1\/2, -1\/2) = (π sin( (1\/2) * π * (-1\/2) )) \/ (sin( (1\/2) * π ) * sin( (-1\/2) * π ))\n= (π sin(-π\/4)) \/ (sin(π\/2) * sin(-π\/2))\n= (π * (-√2\/2)) \/ (1 * (-1))\n= π√2 \/ 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the integral directly for these values:\nf(1\/2, -1\/2) = ∫₀^∞ x^(1\/2) \/ (1 + 2x cos(-π\/2) + x²) dx\nSince cos(-π\/2) = cos(π\/2) = 0, the integral is identical to the previous case:\nf(1\/2, -1\/2) = ∫₀^∞ √x \/ (1 + x²) dx = π√2 \/ 2\n\nAgain, the results match. The issue with the proposed formula is more subtle. Let's analyze the correct general formula:\nCorrect formula: F_correct(α, β) = π sin(α(π - π|β|)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π|β|))\nProposed formula: F_proposed(α, β) = π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ))\n\nThe integral itself must be an even function of β, because cos(πβ) is an even function of β.\nf(α, β) = f(α, -β)\nThe correct formula respects this symmetry:\nF_correct(α, -β) = π sin(α(π - π|-β|)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π|-β|)) = π sin(α(π - π|β|)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π|β|)) = F_correct(α, β).\n\nNow let's check the proposed formula's symmetry:\nF_proposed(α, -β) = π sin(απ(-β)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π(-β)))\n= π (-sin(απβ)) \/ (sin(απ) (-sin(πβ)))\n= π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)) = F_proposed(α, β).\nThe proposed formula is also an even function of β.\n\nLet's re-examine the correct formula derivation. The standard result for ∫₀^∞ x^(n-1) \/ (1 + 2x cos(θ) + x²) dx is π sin(θ(1-n)) \/ (sin(θ) sin(nπ)) for 0 < n < 2 and 0 < θ < π.\nIn our case, n = α+1 and θ = πβ.\nThe condition 0 < α+1 < 2 implies -1 < α < 1.\nThe condition 0 < πβ < π implies 0 < β < 1.\nFor β in this range, the result is:\nf(α, β) = π sin(πβ(1-(α+1))) \/ (sin(πβ) sin((α+1)π))\n= π sin(πβ(-α)) \/ (sin(πβ) (-sin(απ)))\n= π (-sin(απβ)) \/ (-sin(πβ) sin(απ))\n= π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ))\n\nThis shows that the proposed formula is actually correct, but only for β ∈ (0, 1).\nFor β ∈ (-1, 0), we must use the fact that f(α, β) = f(α, -β). Let β' = -β, so β' ∈ (0, 1).\nf(α, β) = f(α, β') = π sin(απβ') \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ')) = π sin(απ(-β)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(π(-β))) = π (-sin(απβ)) \/ (sin(απ) (-sin(πβ))) = π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)).\nThe formula holds for β ∈ (-1, 0) as well.\n\nWhat happens at β=0? The denominator sin(πβ) becomes zero.\nf(α, 0) = ∫₀^∞ x^α \/ (1 + 2x + x²) dx = ∫₀^∞ x^α \/ (1+x)² dx.\nThis integral evaluates to (απ) \/ sin(απ), which is the limit of the proposed formula as β -> 0.\nlim (β->0) [ π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)) ] = (1\/sin(απ)) * lim (β->0) [ π sin(απβ) \/ sin(πβ) ]\nUsing L'Hopital's rule or sin(x) ≈ x for small x:\n= (1\/sin(απ)) * (π * απ \/ πβ) = (1\/sin(απ)) * (απ) = απ \/ sin(απ).\n\nThe proposed formula is correct for all β in (-1, 1). The initial \"No\" answer was incorrect. The confusion arises from different forms of the same result in various integral tables. For example, the form π sin(α(π-πβ)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)) is for β ∈ (0,1) and is equivalent to the proposed formula in that range via trigonometric identities.\n\nLet's prove the equivalence for β ∈ (0, 1):\nπ sin(α(π-πβ)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)) = π [sin(απ)cos(απβ) - cos(απ)sin(απβ)] \/ (sin(απ)sin(πβ))\nThis is not equal to π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ)).\n\nLet's re-check the standard formula. The result from Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (3.241.4) is π sin(t(1-μ)) \/ (sin(t) sin(μπ)) with μ=α+1, t=πβ.\nResult = π sin(πβ(1-(α+1))) \/ (sin(πβ) sin((α+1)π)) = π sin(-απβ) \/ (sin(πβ)(-sin(απ))) = π sin(απβ) \/ (sin(απ)sin(πβ)).\nThis derivation is straightforward and confirms the proposed formula is correct for β ∈ (0, 1). As shown earlier, it also holds for β ∈ (-1, 0) and in the limit β -> 0.\n\nTherefore, the initial assessment was wrong. The formula is correct.\n\nFinal Answer: Yes, the formula is correct for all α, β in (-1, 1).\n\nfinal:Let α and β be real numbers in the interval (-1, 1). Let the function f(α, β) be defined by the integral:\nf(α, β) = ∫₀^∞ x^α \/ (1 + 2x cos(πβ) + x²) dx\nDoes f(α, β) equal (π sin(απβ)) \/ (sin(απ) sin(πβ))?\n\nYes, the equality holds for all α, β in the interval (-1, 1).",
