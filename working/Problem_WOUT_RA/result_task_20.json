    "Content":"Let $A$ be a symmetric invertible matrix, $A^T=A$, $A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = I$ Can it be shown that $A^{-1}$ is also symmetric? I seem to remember a proof similar to this from my linear algebra class, but it has been a long time, and I can't find it in my text book.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"In fact, $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$. Indeed, $A^T(A^{-1})^T=(A^{-1}A)^T=I$.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition of a single object. The problem statement is then simplified.\n\nThe original question is about whether the inverse of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric. Let me parse through the question carefully. The user mentions a matrix A that's symmetric (A^T = A), invertible, and that its inverse commutes with A (since A inverse times A is identity, same as A times A inverse). The problem is to show that A inverse is symmetric.\n\nSo, first, identify all the assumptions. The matrix A has two properties: it's symmetric (so transpose equals itself), and it's invertible (so inverse exists). The inverse's properties include commuting with A to give identity. But the key assumptions here are that A is symmetric and invertible. The problem is to prove that A inverse is symmetric.\n\nWait, the example given in the format includes assumptions like \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\". Each assumption is a separate line. So in this case, the matrix A has properties: symmetric, invertible. Each of these is a separate assumption. However, the invertible part is mentioned in the question, but the problem statement might need to have those as assumptions. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question says: \"Let A be a symmetric invertible matrix, A^T = A, A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = I\". So the user lists that A is symmetric, invertible, and that the inverse commutes. But actually, the invertibility implies that the inverse exists and commutes, so maybe the key assumptions are that A is symmetric and invertible. The commutation is a result of the inverse existing. So perhaps the assumptions are:\n\n- A is a symmetric matrix (A^T = A)\n- A is invertible (so there exists A^{-1} such that A A^{-1} = I and A^{-1} A = I)\n\nThen the problem is to show that A^{-1} is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions would be each on their own line. Each applies to A. The problem is to show the inverse is symmetric.\n\nSo structuring that:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is invertible.\n\nProblem:\nProve that A^{-1} is also symmetric.\n\nWait, but in the original example, the user included both \"n is an integer\" and \"n is divisible by 7\" as separate assumptions. Here, \"A is symmetric\" and \"A is invertible\" are separate properties. So that's two assumptions. The problem is to show the inverse is symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem should be:\n\nAssumption:\nA is a symmetric matrix,\nA is invertible.\nProblem:\nProve that A^{-1} is symmetric.\n\nBut the user also included in the original problem statement that A^{-1}A = AA^{-1} = I, but that's part of the definition of invertible matrices. So perhaps the key assumptions are the two: symmetry and invertibility. The rest follows from the definition of inverse. So in the formatted problem, those would be the two assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should follow this structure.",

    "judge":"Let me analyze this problem step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the assumptions**\n- Assumption 1: A is symmetric (A = A^T)\n- Assumption 2: A is invertible (A^{-1} exists)\n\n**Step 2: Check if there's a redundant assumption**\nTo prove A^{-1} is symmetric, we need to show (A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}.\n\nProof:\n1. Since A is symmetric: A = A^T\n2. Multiply both sides by A^{-1} on the left: A^{-1}A = A^{-1}A^T\n3. This gives: I = A^{-1}A^T\n4. Now multiply both sides by (A^{-1})^T on the right: I(A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}A^T(A^{-1})^T\n5. This gives: (A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}(A(A^{-1}))^T = A^{-1}I^T = A^{-1}I = A^{-1}\n\nThe proof only requires A to be symmetric and invertible. Both assumptions are necessary:\n- If A is not symmetric, A^{-1} may not be symmetric\n- If A is not invertible, A^{-1} doesn't exist\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nThere is no redundant assumption - both are needed for the proof.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer_to_Q1\": \"No\",\n  \"assumptions\": [\"A is a symmetric matrix\", \"A is invertible\"],\n  \"redundant_assumption\": \"no\",\n  \"new_problem\": \"no\",\n  \"solution_for_new_problem\": \"no\"\n}\n```",

We know that for any invertible matrix, (Aᵀ)⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ. Since A is symmetric, A = Aᵀ. Substituting this into the property, we get (A)⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ. This simplifies to A⁻¹ = (A⁻¹)ᵀ, which proves that A⁻¹ is symmetric. Both assumptions (A is symmetric and A is invertible) are necessary for this proof.",
