proof_sketch:  Proof sketch: 
Step 1) Verify C^1([a,b]) is a vector space: Show closure under addition (if f,g ∈ C^1, then f+g ∈ C^1 with (f+g)' = f' + g'), closure under scalar multiplication (if f ∈ C^1 and α ∈ ℝ, then αf ∈ C^1 with (αf)' = αf'), and existence of zero element (0 function is in C^1). Other vector space properties follow from standard function space properties.

Step 2) Verify norm properties for C^1-norm:
   a) Non-negativity and definiteness: ||f|| = sup|f(x)| + sup|f'(x)| ≥ 0 since both suprema are ≥ 0. ||f|| = 0 iff sup|f(x)| = 0 and sup|f'(x)| = 0, which implies f(x) = 0 and f'(x) = 0 for all x ∈ [a,b], so f = 0.
   
   b) Homogeneity: ||αf|| = sup|αf(x)| + sup|αf'(x)| = |α|sup|f(x)| + |α|sup|f'(x)| = |α|(sup|f(x)| + sup|f'(x)|) = |α|·||f||.
   
   c) Triangle inequality: ||f+g|| = sup|f(x)+g(x)| + sup|f'(x)+g'(x)| ≤ (sup|f(x)| + sup|g(x)|) + (sup|f'(x)| + sup|g'(x)|) = (sup|f(x)| + sup|f'(x)|) + (sup|g(x)| + sup|g'(x)|) = ||f|| + ||g||, using triangle inequality for absolute values and properties of supremum.

Step 3) Conclude that C^1([a,b]) with C^1-norm satisfies all requirements for a normed linear space: it is a vector space equipped with a valid norm.

detailed_proof:  We need to prove that $C^1([a,b])$ equipped with the $C^1$-norm forms a normed linear space. This requires showing two main things: (1) $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, and (2) the $C^1$-norm satisfies all the properties of a norm.

**Part 1: $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space**

Let $C^1([a,b]) = \{f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R} \mid f \text{ is differentiable on } [a,b] \text{ and } f' \text{ is continuous on } [a,b]\}$.

We verify the vector space axioms:

1. **Closure under addition**: For any $f, g \in C^1([a,b])$, define $h = f + g$. Then for all $x \in [a,b]$:
   - $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ is well-defined.
   - Since $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on $[a,b]$, their sum $h$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   - Since $f'$ and $g'$ are continuous on $[a,b]$, their sum $h' = f' + g'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
   Therefore, $h = f + g \in C^1([a,b])$.

2. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any $f \in C^1([a,b])$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, define $h = \alpha f$. Then for all $x \in [a,b]$:
   - $h(x) = \alpha f(x)$ is well-defined.
   - Since $f$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$, $h$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $h'(x) = \alpha f'(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   - Since $f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $h' = \alpha f'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$.
   Therefore, $h = \alpha f \in C^1([a,b])$.

3. **Zero element**: The zero function $\mathbf{0}: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\mathbf{0}(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$ is in $C^1([a,b])$ because:
   - $\mathbf{0}$ is differentiable on $[a,b]$ with derivative $\mathbf{0}'(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   - $\mathbf{0}'$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ (it's the constant zero function).

4. **Other vector space properties**: The remaining vector space properties (associativity and commutativity of addition, distributivity of scalar multiplication, existence of additive inverses, etc.) follow from the fact that $C^1([a,b])$ is a subset of the vector space of all functions from $[a,b]$ to $\mathbb{R}$, and these properties are inherited.

Thus, $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.

**Part 2: The $C^1$-norm is a valid norm**

Define the $C^1$-norm for $f \in C^1([a,b])$ as:
$$\lVert f \rVert = \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)|.$$

We verify the three norm axioms:

1. **Non-negativity and definiteness**:
   - For any $f \in C^1([a,b])$, $|f(x)| \geq 0$ and $|f'(x)| \geq 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$. Therefore, their suprema are also non-negative: $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| \geq 0$ and $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \geq 0$. Hence, $\lVert f \rVert \geq 0$.
   - If $\lVert f \rVert = 0$, then $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$. Since both terms are non-negative, this implies $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ and $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$.
   - $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| = 0$ implies $|f(x)| = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$, so $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   - $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| = 0$ implies $|f'(x)| = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$, so $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
   - Therefore, $f$ is the zero function. Conversely, if $f = \mathbf{0}$, then $\lVert f \rVert = 0$.

2. **Homogeneity**: For any $f \in C^1([a,b])$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   \lVert \alpha f \rVert &= \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |\alpha f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |\alpha f'(x)| \\
   &= \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |\alpha| \cdot |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |\alpha| \cdot |f'(x)| \\
   &= |\alpha| \cdot \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + |\alpha| \cdot \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \\
   &= |\alpha| \left( \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \right) \\
   &= |\alpha| \cdot \lVert f \rVert.
   \end{aligned}$$
   The step $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} |\alpha f(x)| = |\alpha| \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)|$ follows from the property of supremum: for any constant $c \geq 0$, $\sup_{x \in S} c \cdot g(x) = c \cdot \sup_{x \in S} g(x)$.

3. **Triangle inequality**: For any $f, g \in C^1([a,b])$:
   $$\begin{aligned}
   \lVert f + g \rVert &= \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x) + g(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x) + g'(x)| \\
   &\leq \sup_{x \in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} (|f'(x)| + |g'(x)|) \quad \text{(by triangle inequality for absolute value)} \\
   &\leq \left( \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g(x)| \right) + \left( \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \right) \\
   &= \left( \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f'(x)| \right) + \left( \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g'(x)| \right) \\
   &= \lVert f \rVert + \lVert g \rVert.
   \end{aligned}$$
   The inequality $\sup_{x \in [a,b]} (|f(x)| + |g(x)|) \leq \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g(x)|$ holds because for each $x$, $|f(x)| + |g(x)| \leq \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f(x)| + \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |g(x)|$, so the supremum of the left side cannot exceed the right side.

**Conclusion**:
We have shown that:
1. $C^1([a,b])$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
2. The $C^1$-norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ satisfies all the properties of a norm: non-negativity, definiteness, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality.

Therefore, $(C^1([a,b]), \lVert \cdot \rVert)$ is a normed linear space.

detailed_proof:  We will prove by contradiction that X must be infinite.

1. **Assume for contradiction that X is finite.** Let X have n elements, where n is a positive integer (if n = 0, then X is empty, which is finite by definition, but we consider the non-trivial case).

2. **If X is finite with n elements, then every subset of X is finite.** This is because any subset of a finite set is itself finite. Therefore, the set of all finite subsets of X, denoted S, is exactly the power set of X, i.e., S = P(X) = {A ⊆ X}.

3. **The cardinality of S when X is finite.** For a finite set X with n elements, the power set P(X) has cardinality 2^n. Thus, |S| = 2^n.

4. **The cardinality of X when finite.** Since X has n elements, |X| = n.

5. **Context from the problem framework.** The problem arises in a context where we are ultimately interested in establishing the cardinality equality |S| = |X| (as indicated by previous analysis notes). If X were finite, we would have |S| = 2^n and |X| = n. For the equality |S| = |X| to hold, we would need 2^n = n.

6. **Analysis of the equation 2^n = n.** We examine this equation for positive integers n:
   - For n = 1: 2^1 = 2 ≠ 1
   - For n = 2: 2^2 = 4 ≠ 2
   - For n = 3: 2^3 = 8 ≠ 3
   - In general, for any positive integer n, we can prove by induction that 2^n > n for all n ≥ 1:
     * Base case (n=1): 2^1 = 2 > 1 ✓
     * Inductive step: Assume 2^k > k for some k ≥ 1. Then 2^{k+1} = 2·2^k > 2·k ≥ k+1 (since k ≥ 1 implies 2k ≥ k+1).
   - Therefore, the equation 2^n = n has no solution among positive integers.

7. **Contradiction.** Our assumption that X is finite leads to the requirement that 2^n = n for some positive integer n, which is impossible. This contradicts the implicit condition that |S| = |X| must hold in the broader problem context.

8. **Conclusion.** Since assuming X is finite leads to a contradiction, X cannot be finite. Therefore, X must be an infinite set.

**Alternative perspective:** Even without explicitly invoking the condition |S| = |X|, if we consider that S being defined as 'all finite subsets of X' is typically studied in contexts where X is infinite (as the case of finite X yields the ordinary power set), the contradiction arises from the fact that for finite X, the set S would have cardinality 2^n which grows exponentially with n, while any meaningful comparison with |X| would require exponential growth to match linear growth, which is impossible for finite n.

Step 2) For finitely generated free modules, use induction on the rank. Base case: rank 1 free module F ≅ R. Submodules of R are ideals, which are principal since R is a PID, hence free of rank 0 or 1.
Step 3) Induction step: For rank n free module F, consider projection π: F → R onto first coordinate. π(N) is an ideal I of R, hence principal I = (a). Choose n ∈ N with π(n) = a.
Step 4) Show N = R·n ⊕ N' where N' = N ∩ ker(π) is a submodule of a free module of rank n-1.

detailed_proof:  We prove the theorem for finitely generated free modules. For infinite rank free modules, additional conditions (such as countable generation) are required for the theorem to hold.

**Setup and Notation:**
Let R be a principal ideal domain (PID). Let F be a free R-module with basis {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ} (finite rank n). Let N be a submodule of F.

**Proof by induction on the rank n of F:**

**Base Case (n = 1):**
When n = 1, F ≅ R as R-modules via the isomorphism φ: F → R defined by φ(re₁) = r. Under this isomorphism, the submodule N corresponds to an ideal I ⊆ R. Since R is a PID, every ideal is principal, so I = (a) for some a ∈ R.

If a = 0, then I = {0}, so N = {0} which is the zero module, which is free with empty basis (rank 0).

If a ≠ 0, then I = (a) ≅ R as R-modules via the map r ↦ ra. Thus N ≅ R, which is free of rank 1.

Therefore, in the rank 1 case, N is free (of rank 0 or 1).

**Induction Hypothesis:**
Assume that for any free R-module of rank ≤ n-1, every submodule is free.

**Induction Step (rank n):**
Let F be a free R-module of rank n with basis {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ}. Consider the projection map π: F → R onto the first coordinate, defined by:
π(r₁e₁ + r₂e₂ + ... + rₙeₙ) = r₁.

Let I = π(N) ⊆ R. Since π is an R-module homomorphism and N is a submodule, I is a submodule of R, i.e., an ideal of R. Since R is a PID, I is principal: I = (a) for some a ∈ R.

**Case 1: a = 0.**
If a = 0, then I = {0}, so π(N) = {0}. This means N ⊆ ker(π). But ker(π) is the submodule generated by {e₂, ..., eₙ}, which is free of rank n-1. By the induction hypothesis applied to N as a submodule of ker(π) (which has rank n-1), N is free.

**Case 2: a ≠ 0.**
If a ≠ 0, choose an element n₀ ∈ N such that π(n₀) = a. Write n₀ = ae₁ + r₂e₂ + ... + rₙeₙ for some r₂, ..., rₙ ∈ R.

Define N' = N ∩ ker(π). We claim that N = R·n₀ ⊕ N'.

**Proof of direct sum decomposition:**
1. **Sum:** For any n ∈ N, we have π(n) ∈ I = (a), so π(n) = ra for some r ∈ R. Then π(n - rn₀) = π(n) - rπ(n₀) = ra - ra = 0, so n - rn₀ ∈ ker(π) ∩ N = N'. Thus n = rn₀ + (n - rn₀) ∈ R·n₀ + N'.

2. **Intersection:** Suppose x ∈ R·n₀ ∩ N'. Then x = rn₀ for some r ∈ R, and since x ∈ N' ⊆ ker(π), we have 0 = π(x) = π(rn₀) = rπ(n₀) = ra. Since a ≠ 0 and R is an integral domain, r = 0. Thus x = 0.

Therefore, N = R·n₀ ⊕ N'.

Now, R·n₀ ≅ R via the map r ↦ rn₀ (this is injective because if rn₀ = 0, then π(rn₀) = ra = 0 implies r = 0 since a ≠ 0). So R·n₀ is free of rank 1.

Also, N' = N ∩ ker(π) is a submodule of ker(π), which is free of rank n-1 (with basis {e₂, ..., eₙ}). By the induction hypothesis, N' is free.

Since N is the direct sum of two free modules, N is free. The rank of N is rank(R·n₀) + rank(N') = 1 + rank(N').

**Conclusion:**
By induction, for any finitely generated free R-module F over a PID R, every submodule N of F is free.

**Remark on infinite rank:**
For free modules of infinite rank, the theorem does not hold in general without additional hypotheses. For example, if R = ℤ (a PID) and F is a free ℤ-module of countably infinite rank, there exist submodules that are not free. However, if the submodule N is countably generated, or more generally, if certain chain conditions are satisfied, the result may still hold. The proof above specifically addresses the finitely generated case.
