  "detailed_proof": "We will prove that $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field (a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$) of degree 3 by following the proof sketch step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Show that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$**\nLet $\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$. Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$. We have $f(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$. Therefore, $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Prove $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$**\nWe apply Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p = 2$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are: $a_3 = 1$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_1 = 0$, $a_0 = -2$. We check:\n1. $p = 2$ divides all non-leading coefficients: $2 \\mid 0$, $2 \\mid 0$, $2 \\mid (-2)$\n2. $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term: $4 \\nmid (-2)$\n3. The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied, $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: $f(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$**\nSince $f(x)$ is monic, irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, and has $\alpha$ as a root, it must be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of smallest degree with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ having $\alpha$ as a root.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the field extension $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$**\nThe field $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ consists of all polynomial expressions in $\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2}$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\alpha^3 = 2$, any power $\alpha^n$ with $n \\geq 3$ can be reduced using the relation $\alpha^3 = 2$. Therefore, every element of $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ can be written uniquely in the form:\n$$a + b\\alpha + c\\alpha^2$$\nwhere $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha^2 = (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2 = \\sqrt[3]{4}$.\n\n**Step 5: Show $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ as fields**\nConsider the evaluation homomorphism:\n$$\\phi: \\mathbb{Q}[x] \\to \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$$\ndefined by $\\phi(g(x)) = g(\\alpha)$. This is a ring homomorphism. The kernel of $\phi$ is precisely the set of polynomials that vanish at $\alpha$, which is the ideal generated by the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$. Therefore, $\\ker(\\phi) = (x^3 - 2)$.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings:\n$$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\operatorname{im}(\\phi)$$\nSince $\phi$ is surjective (every element $a + b\\alpha + c\\alpha^2$ is the image of $a + bx + cx^2$), we have:\n$$\\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$$\n\nMoreover, since $f(x)$ is irreducible, the ideal $(x^3 - 2)$ is maximal in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, making $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ a field. Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is also a field.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the extension degree $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\mathbb{Q}]$**\nThe degree of the field extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial of the primitive element $\alpha$. Since the minimal polynomial $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ has degree 3, we have:\n$$[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\deg(f(x)) = 3$$\n\nAlternatively, we can see that $\\{1, \\alpha, \\alpha^2\\}$ forms a basis for $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. This basis has 3 elements, confirming the dimension is 3.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3**\nA number field is defined as a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We have shown:\n1. $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a field extension of $\mathbb{Q}$\n2. The extension is finite with degree $[\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]:\\mathbb{Q}] = 3$\n\nTherefore, $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Additional verification**: To confirm $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is indeed a field (not just a ring), we note that for any nonzero element $a + b\\alpha + c\\alpha^2$, its inverse exists in $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ because:\n1. The minimal polynomial $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible, so $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ is a field\n2. The isomorphism $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^3 - 2)$ preserves the field structure\n\nThus, we have rigorously proven that $\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]$ is a number field of degree 3 over $\mathbb{Q}$."

detailed_proof:  We prove that any vector field A in three-dimensional Euclidean space ℝ³ can be expressed in terms of component functions relative to the standard basis.

**Step 1: Definition of vector field in ℝ³**
By Assumption 1, A is a vector field in ℝ³. This means A assigns to each point (x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³ a vector A(x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³. Formally, A: ℝ³ → ℝ³ is a function from ℝ³ to ℝ³.

**Step 2: Standard orthonormal basis for ℝ³**
Let {i, j, k} be the standard orthonormal basis for ℝ³, where:
i = (1, 0, 0), j = (0, 1, 0), k = (0, 0, 1)
This basis has the property that i·i = j·j = k·k = 1 and i·j = j·k = k·i = 0.

**Step 3: Vector decomposition in basis**
At each point (x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³, the vector A(x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors {i, j, k}. This follows from the fact that {i, j, k} forms a basis for ℝ³, meaning any vector in ℝ³ can be written uniquely as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

**Step 4: Definition of component functions**
Define three real-valued functions a, b, c: ℝ³ → ℝ as follows:
For each (x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³:
a(x,y,z) = A(x,y,z)·i (the dot product of A(x,y,z) with i)
b(x,y,z) = A(x,y,z)·j (the dot product of A(x,y,z) with j)
c(x,y,z) = A(x,y,z)·k (the dot product of A(x,y,z) with k)

These definitions are well-defined because A(x,y,z) is a vector in ℝ³ and the dot product with basis vectors yields real numbers.

**Step 5: Representation theorem**
We claim that for all (x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³:
A(x,y,z) = a(x,y,z)i + b(x,y,z)j + c(x,y,z)k

Proof of representation:
Let v = A(x,y,z) for a fixed (x,y,z). Since {i, j, k} is a basis for ℝ³, there exist unique scalars α, β, γ ∈ ℝ such that:
v = αi + βj + γk

Taking dot products with the basis vectors:
v·i = (αi + βj + γk)·i = α(i·i) + β(j·i) + γ(k·i) = α(1) + β(0) + γ(0) = α
v·j = (αi + βj + γk)·j = α(i·j) + β(j·j) + γ(k·j) = α(0) + β(1) + γ(0) = β
v·k = (αi + βj + γk)·k = α(i·k) + β(j·k) + γ(k·k) = α(0) + β(0) + γ(1) = γ

But by our definitions, v·i = a(x,y,z), v·j = b(x,y,z), v·k = c(x,y,z). Therefore:
α = a(x,y,z), β = b(x,y,z), γ = c(x,y,z)

Thus:
A(x,y,z) = a(x,y,z)i + b(x,y,z)j + c(x,y,z)k

**Step 6: Smoothness properties**
From Assumption 2, the component functions of A are twice continuously differentiable. Since we have defined a(x,y,z) = A(x,y,z)·i, and the dot product with a constant vector i is a linear operation, the function a inherits the differentiability properties of A. Specifically:
- If A is continuous, then a is continuous (since a(x,y,z) = A₁(x,y,z) where A₁ is the first component of A)
- If A is differentiable, then a is differentiable
- If A is twice continuously differentiable (as per Assumption 2), then a, b, and c are twice continuously differentiable

More formally, writing A(x,y,z) = (A₁(x,y,z), A₂(x,y,z), A₃(x,y,z)) in coordinates, we have:
a(x,y,z) = A₁(x,y,z), b(x,y,z) = A₂(x,y,z), c(x,y,z) = A₃(x,y,z)

**Step 7: Conclusion**
We have shown that for any vector field A in ℝ³, there exist unique functions a, b, c: ℝ³ → ℝ such that for all (x,y,z) ∈ ℝ³:
A(x,y,z) = a(x,y,z)i + b(x,y,z)j + c(x,y,z)k

Furthermore, from Assumption 2, these component functions a, b, c are twice continuously differentiable. Therefore, A has component functions a(x,y,z), b(x,y,z), and c(x,y,z).

**Additional note on Assumption 3**: While Assumption 3 mentions the operators ∇, ∇×, ∇·, and ∇², these are not directly used in proving the existence of component functions. However, they are relevant for subsequent applications where these operators act on the component functions, and the smoothness assumption (Assumption 2) ensures these operations are well-defined.

detailed_proof:  We are asked to prove that if n is an integer and n > 2, then n > 3. To prove such an implication, we need to show that for every integer n satisfying the assumptions (n is an integer and n > 2), the conclusion (n > 3) must hold.

Let us examine whether this statement is true by considering all integers n > 2:
- n = 3: This satisfies both assumptions (3 is an integer and 3 > 2). However, the conclusion n > 3 would require 3 > 3, which is false since 3 = 3.
- n = 4: This satisfies both assumptions (4 is an integer and 4 > 2) and also satisfies the conclusion (4 > 3).
- n = 5: This satisfies both assumptions and the conclusion.
- In fact, for all integers n ≥ 4, the conclusion holds.

However, the existence of n = 3 as a counterexample is sufficient to show that the statement "if n is an integer and n > 2, then n > 3" is false. A single counterexample invalidates a universal statement.

Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given assumptions because it is not true. The assumptions are insufficient to guarantee the conclusion. To make the statement provable, we would need additional assumptions, such as n > 3 or n ≥ 4.

In summary:
1. The statement to prove is: ∀n ∈ ℤ, (n > 2 → n > 3)
2. We found n = 3 ∈ ℤ such that n > 2 is true but n > 3 is false
3. This counterexample shows the universal statement is false
4. Therefore, the statement cannot be proven from the given assumptions.

detailed_proof:  We are given: f: ℂ → ℂ \ {a,b} is holomorphic and non-constant.

Proof:

1. Since f is defined on all of ℂ and is holomorphic, f is an entire function.

2. Recall Picard's Little Theorem: Every non-constant entire function attains every complex value with at most one exception. In other words, a non-constant entire function can omit at most one complex number from its range.

3. By assumption, f is non-constant and entire. Therefore, by Picard's Little Theorem, f can omit at most one complex value.

4. The codomain of f is ℂ \ {a,b}, which means that for all z ∈ ℂ, f(z) ≠ a and f(z) ≠ b. Thus f omits both a and b from its range.

5. Since f omits both a and b, and by Picard's theorem a non-constant entire function can omit at most one value, it follows that a and b cannot be two distinct complex numbers. If they were distinct, then f would be omitting two distinct values, contradicting Picard's theorem.

6. Therefore, we must have a = b.

7. This completes the proof: If f: ℂ → ℂ \ {a,b} is holomorphic and non-constant, then a = b.

Alternative perspective: The contrapositive statement is also true: If a ≠ b, then any holomorphic function f: ℂ → ℂ \ {a,b} must be constant. This follows immediately from the same reasoning: if a ≠ b, then f omits two distinct values, so by Picard's theorem, f cannot be non-constant; hence f must be constant.

detailed_proof:  We are given that $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined by $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$. To prove that $f$ is a real-valued function, we need to show that for every $x$ in the domain $\mathbb{R}$, the value $f(x)$ is a real number.

**Step 1: Domain specification**
By Assumption 1, the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. This means we consider $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Step 2: Square operation**
For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$, we compute $x^2$. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is closed under multiplication (the product of any two real numbers is a real number), and $x^2 = x \cdot x$, it follows that $x^2 \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Step 3: Sine function application**
The sine function $\sin: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined for all real numbers. For any real number $y = x^2$ obtained in Step 2, $\sin(y)$ is defined. Moreover, the sine function has the property that for all $y \in \mathbb{R}$, $\sin(y) \in [-1, 1] \subset \mathbb{R}$. This is a fundamental property of the trigonometric sine function: its range is the closed interval $[-1, 1]$, which is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$.

**Step 4: Composition yields real output**
Since $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$ is the composition of two functions:
1. The squaring function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $g(x) = x^2$
2. The sine function $h: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $h(y) = \sin(y)$

We have $f = h \circ g$. For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$:
- $g(x) = x^2 \in \mathbb{R}$ (from Step 2)
- Then $f(x) = h(g(x)) = \sin(x^2) \in \mathbb{R}$ (from Step 3)

**Step 5: Conclusion**
We have shown that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (the domain of $f$), $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$ is a real number. Therefore, $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is indeed a real-valued function.

**Alternative justification**: The function $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$ is a composition of elementary functions:
- $x \mapsto x^2$ is a polynomial function, which maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0, \infty) \subset \mathbb{R}$
- $y \mapsto \sin(y)$ is a trigonometric function, which maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $[-1, 1] \subset \mathbb{R}$
The composition of these functions therefore maps $\mathbb{R}$ to a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, confirming that $f$ is real-valued.
