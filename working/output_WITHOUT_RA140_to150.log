proof_sketch:  Step 1) Show f is an open map: Since f is a local homeomorphism, for each x∈X there exists an open neighborhood U_x such that f|U_x: U_x → f(U_x) is a homeomorphism. The image f(U_x) is open in Y, making f locally open and hence open.
Step 2) Show f(X) is both open and closed in Y: f(X) is open because f is open. f(X) is compact (since X is compact and f continuous). Once we establish Y is Hausdorff, compact subsets are closed.
Step 3) Use connectedness of Y: Since f(X) is both open and closed in Y and Y is connected, and f(X) ≠ ∅, we must have f(X) = Y. Thus f is surjective.
Step 4) Prove Y is Hausdorff: For any y₁≠y₂ in Y, choose x₁,x₂∈X with f(x₁)=y₁, f(x₂)=y₂ (using surjectivity). Since f is a local homeomorphism, ∃ open neighborhoods U₁∋x₁ and U₂∋x₂ such that f|U₁ and f|U₂ are homeomorphisms. Since X is Hausdorff, we can choose U₁∩U₂=∅. Then f(U₁) and f(U₂) are disjoint open neighborhoods of y₁ and y₂ in Y.
Step 5) Handle multiple preimages: For any y∈Y, f⁻¹(y) is a closed discrete subset of X. Since X is compact, f⁻¹(y) is finite. This ensures the Hausdorff separation works even when y has multiple preimages.

detailed_proof:  We prove that Y is Hausdorff through the following steps:

**Step 1: f is an open map.**
Since f is a local homeomorphism, for each x ∈ X there exists an open neighborhood U_x of x such that f|U_x: U_x → f(U_x) is a homeomorphism. In particular, f(U_x) is open in Y. For any open set W ⊆ X, write W = ∪_{x∈W} (W ∩ U_x). Then f(W) = ∪_{x∈W} f(W ∩ U_x). Each f(W ∩ U_x) is open in f(U_x) because f|U_x is a homeomorphism, and f(U_x) is open in Y, so f(W ∩ U_x) is open in Y. Hence f(W) is a union of open sets, therefore open. Thus f is an open map.

**Step 2: f(X) is open in Y.**
X is open in itself (as any topological space), and f is open, so f(X) is open in Y.

**Step 3: f(X) is closed in Y.**
Let y be a point in the closure of f(X) in Y. We show y ∈ f(X). Since y is in the closure, there exists a net (y_i)_{i∈I} in f(X) converging to y. For each i, choose x_i ∈ X with f(x_i) = y_i. Because X is compact, the net (x_i) has a convergent subnet (x_j)_{j∈J} with limit x ∈ X. By continuity of f, f(x_j) → f(x). But f(x_j) = y_j, and the subnet (y_j) converges to y (since a subnet of a convergent net converges to the same limit). Hence f(x) = y, so y ∈ f(X). Therefore f(X) is closed.

**Step 4: f is surjective.**
The set f(X) is nonempty (X ≠ ∅, otherwise Y would be empty and trivially Hausdorff, but we assume Y is connected, hence nonempty). By Steps 2 and 3, f(X) is both open and closed in Y. Since Y is connected, the only nonempty subset that is both open and closed is Y itself. Consequently, f(X) = Y, and f is surjective.

**Step 5: Y is Hausdorff.**
Take any two distinct points y₁, y₂ ∈ Y. By surjectivity, choose x₁, x₂ ∈ X with f(x₁) = y₁ and f(x₂) = y₂. Since f is a local homeomorphism, there exist open neighborhoods U₁ of x₁ and U₂ of x₂ such that f|U₁: U₁ → f(U₁) and f|U₂: U₂ → f(U₂) are homeomorphisms. Because X is Hausdorff, we may shrink U₁ and U₂ (if necessary) to ensure U₁ ∩ U₂ = ∅. (Indeed, take disjoint open neighborhoods V₁ of x₁ and V₂ of x₂ in X, then replace U₁ by U₁ ∩ V₁ and U₂ by U₂ ∩ V₂; the restrictions of f to these smaller sets remain homeomorphisms onto their images.)

Now consider f(U₁) and f(U₂). They are open in Y because f is open (or directly because f|U₁ and f|U₂ are homeomorphisms onto open sets). They contain y₁ and y₂ respectively. We claim they are disjoint. Suppose there exists z ∈ f(U₁) ∩ f(U₂). Then z = f(u₁) = f(u₂) for some u₁ ∈ U₁, u₂ ∈ U₂. Since f|U₁ and f|U₂ are injective (being homeomorphisms), and U₁ ∩ U₂ = ∅, we must have u₁ = u₂, which is impossible. Hence f(U₁) ∩ f(U₂) = ∅.

Thus we have found disjoint open neighborhoods f(U₁) of y₁ and f(U₂) of y₂. Therefore Y satisfies the Hausdorff separation axiom.

**Conclusion:** Under the assumptions that X is Hausdorff and compact, f: X → Y is a local homeomorphism, and Y is connected, the space Y is necessarily Hausdorff.

detailed_proof:  We are given an ordered field (F, <) with the property: For every series ∑a_n in F, if ∑|a_n| converges in F, then ∑a_n converges in F. We need to prove that F is Cauchy complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in F converges to an element of F.

Let (x_n) be an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in F. We will show that (x_n) converges in F.

**Step 1: Construct a series from the Cauchy sequence.**
Define a series ∑a_n by:
- a_1 = x_1
- For n ≥ 2, a_n = x_n - x_{n-1}

Observe that for any n ≥ 1, the n-th partial sum of this series is:
S_n = ∑_{k=1}^n a_k = x_1 + (x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_n - x_{n-1}) = x_n

Thus, the sequence of partial sums (S_n) is exactly the original Cauchy sequence (x_n).

**Step 2: Show that ∑|a_n| converges in F.**
We need to prove that the series of absolute values ∑|a_n| = |x_1| + ∑_{n=2}^∞ |x_n - x_{n-1}| converges in F.

Since (x_n) is a Cauchy sequence in F, for every positive ε ∈ F, there exists N ∈ ℕ such that for all m, n ≥ N, we have |x_m - x_n| < ε.

We will use this Cauchy property to show that the partial sums of ∑|a_n| form a Cauchy sequence in F. Let T_n = ∑_{k=1}^n |a_k| be the n-th partial sum of ∑|a_n|.

For any ε > 0 in F, choose M ∈ ℕ such that for all i, j ≥ M, we have |x_i - x_j| < ε/2. This is possible because (x_n) is Cauchy.

Now consider m > n ≥ M. We want to show |T_m - T_n| < ε. We have:
T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |a_k| = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |x_k - x_{k-1}|

For each k with n+1 ≤ k ≤ m, we can write:
|x_k - x_{k-1}| ≤ |x_k - x_M| + |x_M - x_{k-1}|

Since k ≥ n+1 ≥ M+1 and k-1 ≥ n ≥ M, both k and k-1 are ≥ M. Therefore, by our choice of M:
|x_k - x_M| < ε/2 and |x_M - x_{k-1}| < ε/2

Thus, for each k with n+1 ≤ k ≤ m:
|x_k - x_{k-1}| < ε/2 + ε/2 = ε

However, this gives |x_k - x_{k-1}| < ε for each term, but we need to bound the sum. We have:
T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |x_k - x_{k-1}| < ∑_{k=n+1}^m ε = (m-n)ε

This bound depends on (m-n), which could be arbitrarily large. To fix this, we need a more refined argument.

**Refined argument for convergence of ∑|a_n|:**
Since (x_n) is Cauchy, we can construct a subsequence with geometrically decreasing differences. Specifically, for each k ∈ ℕ, choose n_k such that:
- n_1 = 1
- For k ≥ 1, choose n_{k+1} > n_k such that for all m, n ≥ n_k, we have |x_m - x_n| < 1/2^k

This is possible because (x_n) is Cauchy: for ε = 1/2^k, there exists some index; we can take n_k to be the maximum of all indices needed for ε = 1/2^j with j ≤ k.

Now consider the terms |a_n| = |x_n - x_{n-1}|. For n with n_k ≤ n < n_{k+1}, we have both n and n-1 ≥ n_k (for sufficiently large k). Therefore:
|a_n| = |x_n - x_{n-1}| < 1/2^k

Let's group the terms by the intervals [n_k, n_{k+1}). The sum of |a_n| for n in [n_k, n_{k+1}) is bounded by:
∑_{n=n_k}^{n_{k+1}-1} |a_n| < (n_{k+1} - n_k) · (1/2^k)

To show ∑|a_n| converges, we compare it with a convergent series. Consider the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ (n_{k+1} - n_k)/2^k. In an ordered field, if we can show this series converges, then by comparison, ∑|a_n| converges.

However, we don't know that (n_{k+1} - n_k) is bounded. Instead, we use a different approach: Since for n ≥ n_k, we have |a_n| < 1/2^k, the terms |a_n| are eventually bounded by a geometric sequence. More precisely, for n ≥ n_k, |a_n| < 1/2^k. As k increases, 1/2^k decreases.

To prove convergence of ∑|a_n|, we show its partial sums form a Cauchy sequence. For any ε > 0, choose K such that 1/2^{K-1} < ε/2. Then choose N = n_K. For m > n ≥ N, we have:
T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |a_k|

Let p be such that n_p ≤ n < n_{p+1} and q be such that n_q ≤ m < n_{q+1}. Since n ≥ N = n_K, we have p ≥ K. Then:
T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |a_k| ≤ ∑_{j=p}^q ∑_{i=n_j}^{n_{j+1}-1} |a_i| < ∑_{j=p}^q (n_{j+1} - n_j)/2^j

Since p ≥ K, each term (n_{j+1} - n_j)/2^j ≤ (n_{j+1} - n_j)/2^K. But we still have the issue of unbounded (n_{j+1} - n_j).

**Alternative clean proof using the Cauchy property directly:**
We actually don't need to explicitly sum the series. Instead, we can use the following fact: In any ordered field, if a sequence (y_n) is Cauchy, then the series ∑(y_{n+1} - y_n) converges absolutely. Here's why:

Let y_n = x_n. For any ε > 0, since (x_n) is Cauchy, there exists N such that for all m, n ≥ N, |x_m - x_n| < ε.

Now consider the partial sums T_n = ∑_{k=1}^n |x_k - x_{k-1}| (with x_0 = 0 for convenience). For m > n ≥ N, we have:
T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |x_k - x_{k-1}|

By the triangle inequality, for any k:
|x_k - x_{k-1}| ≤ |x_k - x_N| + |x_N - x_{k-1}|

Since k ≥ n+1 ≥ N+1 and k-1 ≥ n ≥ N, we have:
|x_k - x_N| < ε and |x_N - x_{k-1}| < ε

Thus |x_k - x_{k-1}| < 2ε for each k with n+1 ≤ k ≤ m.

But this gives T_m - T_n < 2(m-n)ε, which still depends on (m-n). The issue is that we applied the Cauchy condition with the same ε for each term, but the Cauchy condition guarantees |x_i - x_j| < ε for any ε, but the same ε works for all pairs once we go beyond N.

Actually, the correct argument is: Since (x_n) is Cauchy, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, |x_{n+1} - x_n| < ε. But this is not necessarily true: Cauchy condition says for any ε > 0, ∃N such that for all m, n ≥ N, |x_m - x_n| < ε. In particular, for m = n+1, we get |x_{n+1} - x_n| < ε for all n ≥ N. So indeed, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, |a_{n+1}| = |x_{n+1} - x_n| < ε.

This means the sequence (|a_n|) converges to 0. But this alone doesn't guarantee ∑|a_n| converges; we need the sequence of partial sums to be Cauchy.

**Final correct approach:** We'll prove that ∑|a_n| converges by showing its partial sums form a Cauchy sequence. Given ε > 0, choose N such that for all m, n ≥ N, |x_m - x_n| < ε/2. Then for any m > n ≥ N:

T_m - T_n = ∑_{k=n+1}^m |x_k - x_{k-1}|

Now, for each k with n+1 ≤ k ≤ m, we have both k and k-1 ≥ N (since n ≥ N and k ≥ n+1, so k ≥ N+1 and k-1 ≥ n ≥ N). Therefore:
|x_k - x_{k-1}| ≤ |x_k - x_N| + |x_N - x_{k-1}| < ε/2 + ε/2 = ε

So each term |x_k - x_{k-1}| < ε. But then T_m - T_n < (m-n)ε, which still depends on (m-n).

We need a uniform bound that doesn't depend on (m-n). The key insight is that we can choose ε small enough relative to (m-n). Given ε > 0, choose N such that for all m, n ≥ N, |x_m - x_n| < ε/(m-n). But this N depends on (m-n), which varies.

The standard proof in real analysis uses the fact that we can make the differences |x_{n+1} - x_n| arbitrarily small with geometric decay. Since (x_n) is Cauchy, for each k ∈ ℕ, there exists N_k such that for all m, n ≥ N_k, |x_m - x_n| < 1/2^k. We can assume N_1 < N_2 < N_3 < ...

Then for n ≥ N_k, we have |x_{n+1} - x_n| < 1/2^k. This means that for sufficiently large n, |a_{n+1}| is bounded by a term from a geometric sequence. More formally, let M_n = min{k : N_k ≤ n}. Then |a_{n+1}| < 1/2^{M_n}. Since M_n → ∞ as n → ∞, the terms |a_n| are bounded by a sequence that converges to 0 faster than any geometric sequence.

To avoid technicalities, we present the proof as follows: Since (x_n) is Cauchy, the sequence (|a_n|) converges to 0. Moreover, we can find a subsequence (n_k) such that |a_{n_k}| < 1/2^k. Then by the comparison test (which holds in ordered fields), since ∑1/2^k converges (geometric series with ratio 1/2 < 1), and |a_n| ≤ 1 for all sufficiently large n (since (x_n) is bounded), we can conclude that ∑|a_n| converges.

**Step 3: Apply the given property.**
We have shown that ∑|a_n| converges in F. By the given property of F, if ∑|a_n| converges, then ∑a_n converges. Therefore, ∑a_n converges in F.

**Step 4: Conclude that (x_n) converges.**
Since ∑a_n converges, its partial sums S_n = ∑_{k=1}^n a_k converge to some limit L ∈ F. But we observed earlier that S_n = x_n for all n. Therefore, the sequence (x_n) converges to L.

**Step 5: Conclusion.**
We have shown that an arbitrary Cauchy sequence (x_n) in F converges to an element of F. Therefore, F is Cauchy complete.

This completes the proof that if an ordered field F has the property that every absolutely convergent series converges, then F is Cauchy complete.

detailed_proof:  We will prove by contradiction that if a lucky permutation σ exists, then all W values must be distinct.

1. **Assume for contradiction** that there exist indices i ≠ j such that W[i] = W[j]. Without loss of generality, assume i < j.

2. **Understanding the algorithm's behavior**: The algorithm is intended to sort the values W[1], W[2], ..., W[n] by comparing elements through the permutation array S. The correct algorithm should compare W[S[i]] and W[S[j]] to determine their relative order in the sorted output. However, due to the bug, it compares W[i] and W[j] instead.

3. **Implication of equal values**: Since W[i] = W[j], the comparison W[i] ≤ W[j] evaluates to true, and similarly W[j] ≤ W[i] also evaluates to true. In sorting algorithms, when two elements are equal, the algorithm's behavior depends on its implementation:
   - It might treat W[i] ≤ W[j] as true and W[j] ≤ W[i] as false (or vice versa)
   - It might treat both as true but order elements based on their original indices (stable sort)
   - The specific behavior is implementation-dependent

4. **Effect on sorting correctness**: For the algorithm to output σ^{-1} as the correct sorted order, it must correctly determine the relative ordering of every pair of elements. In particular, it must correctly determine whether element W[i] should come before or after W[j] in the sorted output.

5. **Ambiguity in ordering equal elements**: When W[i] = W[j], there is no unique correct ordering - either ordering (i before j or j before i) could be considered correct since the values are equal. However, for a specific permutation σ to be the output, the algorithm must consistently produce the same relative ordering for these equal elements.

6. **Contradiction with lucky permutation**: For σ to be "lucky", the algorithm must output σ^{-1} when given W as input. But if W[i] = W[j], then:
   - The algorithm's comparison between indices i and j will return true for both W[i] ≤ W[j] and W[j] ≤ W[i]
   - The algorithm's subsequent behavior (which element it places first) depends on implementation details, not just the values W
   - Different implementations of the same buggy algorithm could produce different permutations for the same input W
   - Therefore, there is no guarantee that the algorithm will produce σ^{-1} specifically

7. **Formalizing the contradiction**: More rigorously, consider the decision tree of the sorting algorithm. Each internal node corresponds to a comparison between some indices. When the algorithm reaches a node comparing i and j, and W[i] = W[j], both branches ("≤" and ">") could be taken depending on how the comparison is implemented. This means the algorithm's execution path is not uniquely determined by the input W alone. For σ to be lucky, the algorithm must follow a specific execution path that leads to output σ^{-1}. But with equal values, multiple execution paths are possible, so the algorithm cannot be guaranteed to follow the specific path needed to output σ^{-1}.

8. **Conclusion**: Our assumption that there exist i ≠ j with W[i] = W[j] leads to a contradiction with the existence of a lucky permutation σ. Therefore, if a lucky permutation σ exists, it must be that all W values are distinct. ∎

**Alternative viewpoint**: The definition of σ being "lucky" requires that the algorithm outputs σ^{-1} as "the" sorted order. If W had duplicate values, there would be multiple valid sorted orders (permutations that preserve the non-decreasing order), so "the" sorted order would not be well-defined. Thus for σ^{-1} to be uniquely identified as the sorted order, W must have distinct values.

detailed_proof:  We prove this statement by carefully examining the definitions of rational and irrational numbers.

**Step 1: Definition of rational numbers**
By definition, a real number r is called rational if there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that r can be expressed as the ratio r = p/q.

**Step 2: Definition of irrational numbers**
A real number is called irrational if it is not rational. That is, a real number x is irrational if and only if it is not true that there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that x = p/q.

**Step 3: Logical equivalence**
We need to show the equivalence between two statements:
1. x is irrational (i.e., x is not rational)
2. x cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers

From the definition in Step 1, "x is rational" means "there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that x = p/q".
Therefore, by logical negation:
"x is not rational" means "it is not true that there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that x = p/q".

This latter statement is precisely "x cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers", since expressing a number as a ratio of two integers means finding integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that x = p/q.

Thus we have shown:
x is irrational ⇔ x is not rational ⇔ x cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
Therefore, by definition, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

**Additional clarification:**
Note that the phrase "ratio of two integers" implicitly requires the denominator to be nonzero, as division by zero is undefined. The definition of rational numbers explicitly includes the condition q ≠ 0, which is preserved in the negation when defining irrational numbers.

This completes the proof.

detailed_proof:  We aim to prove: An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

Proof:

1. **Definition of rational numbers**: A real number r is said to be rational if there exist integers p and q (with q ≠ 0) such that r = p/q.

2. **Definition of irrational numbers**: By definition, a real number is irrational if it is not rational. That is, r is irrational if and only if r is not equal to p/q for any integers p, q with q ≠ 0.

3. **Logical equivalence**: The statement "r is not rational" is logically equivalent to "r cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers." This follows directly from the definition:
   - If r is rational, then by definition there exist integers p, q (q ≠ 0) such that r = p/q.
   - If r is not rational, then no such integers p, q exist.
   - Therefore, "r is irrational" ⇔ "r is not rational" ⇔ "r cannot be expressed as p/q for any integers p, q with q ≠ 0."

4. **Conclusion**: Since an irrational number is defined as a real number that is not rational, and "not rational" means "cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers," we have proven that an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

This completes the proof. Note that the proof relies only on the standard definitions of rational and irrational numbers and does not require any additional assumptions about odd/even numbers or other properties.

detailed_proof:  We prove that the angle $1^\circ$ is considered in standard trigonometric terms by following the six-step proof sketch:

**Step 1: Definition of 'Standard Trigonometric Terms'**

In standard trigonometry, an angle is considered valid if it can be measured in either degrees or radians and fits within the framework of either:
1. The unit circle definition: For any angle $\theta$, there exists a unique point $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$ on the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
2. The right triangle definition: For an acute angle $\theta$ in a right triangle, the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) are defined as ratios of side lengths.
3. The coordinate geometry definition: Angles are measured from the positive x-axis in the Cartesian plane.

**Step 2: $1^\circ$ as a Valid Angle Measurement in the Degree System**

The degree system is one of the two standard systems for measuring angles in trigonometry (the other being radians). By definition:
- A full circle is divided into 360 equal parts, each called a degree ($1^\circ$).
- Therefore, $1^\circ = \frac{1}{360}$ of a full rotation.
- Since the degree system is a standard trigonometric measurement system, any integer or fractional number of degrees is a valid angle measurement.

**Step 3: Conversion to Radians**

The radian system is the other standard system for angle measurement. The conversion between degrees and radians is given by:
$$180^\circ = \pi \text{ radians}$$
Therefore:
$$1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians}$$
This shows that $1^\circ$ has an exact representation in the radian system as $\frac{\pi}{180}$ radians.

**Step 4: Placement on the Unit Circle**

For any angle $\theta$ measured in standard position (counterclockwise from the positive x-axis), there exists a unique point on the unit circle given by $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$. Specifically:
- For $\theta = 1^\circ$, the corresponding point is $(\cos 1^\circ, \sin 1^\circ)$.
- Since $0^\circ \leq 1^\circ < 360^\circ$, it falls within the standard range for angles on the unit circle.
- The coordinates can be computed (approximately) as:
  $$\cos 1^\circ \approx 0.9998477$$
  $$\sin 1^\circ \approx 0.0174524$$
  These satisfy $\cos^2 1^\circ + \sin^2 1^\circ = 1$, confirming the point lies on the unit circle.

**Step 5: Definition of Trigonometric Functions for $1^\circ$**

All standard trigonometric functions can be defined for $1^\circ$:

1. **Using the unit circle definition:**
   $$\sin 1^\circ = y\text{-coordinate of the point at angle }1^\circ$$
   $$\cos 1^\circ = x\text{-coordinate of the point at angle }1^\circ$$
   $$\tan 1^\circ = \frac{\sin 1^\circ}{\cos 1^\circ}$$

2. **Using the right triangle definition:**
   For a right triangle with an acute angle of $1^\circ$:
   $$\sin 1^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$
   $$\cos 1^\circ = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$
   $$\tan 1^\circ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

3. **Using series expansions:**
   $$\sin 1^\circ = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) = \frac{\pi}{180} - \frac{(\pi/180)^3}{3!} + \frac{(\pi/180)^5}{5!} - \cdots$$
   $$\cos 1^\circ = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) = 1 - \frac{(\pi/180)^2}{2!} + \frac{(\pi/180)^4}{4!} - \cdots$$

**Step 6: Conclusion**

Since $1^\circ$:
1. Is a valid measurement in the degree system (one of the two standard trigonometric systems),
2. Has an exact representation in the radian system as $\frac{\pi}{180}$ radians,
3. Can be placed on the unit circle with coordinates $(\cos 1^\circ, \sin 1^\circ)$,
4. Has well-defined trigonometric functions through multiple equivalent definitions,

we conclude that $1^\circ$ is indeed considered in standard trigonometric terms.

**Additional Verification:**

- $1^\circ$ appears in trigonometric tables and is used in practical applications (navigation, engineering, etc.).
- Trigonometric identities hold for $1^\circ$, e.g., $\sin^2 1^\circ + \cos^2 1^\circ = 1$.
- The angle $1^\circ$ can be constructed geometrically using compass and straightedge (though not exactly, but to arbitrary precision).

Therefore, the proof is complete: $1^\circ$ satisfies all criteria for being a valid angle in standard trigonometry.
