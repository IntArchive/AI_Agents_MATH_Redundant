detailed_proof:  We will prove the inequality (1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x) for x approaching 0 using a geometric approach on the unit circle.

**Step 1: Setup of the geometric configuration**
Consider the unit circle centered at the origin O = (0,0) with radius 1. Let A = (1,0) be a fixed point on the circle on the positive x-axis.

**Step 2: Definition of points for angle x**
For a small angle x (measured in radians), let point B be on the unit circle such that ∠AOB = x. Then by definition of trigonometric functions on the unit circle, B has coordinates (cos x, sin x).

**Step 3: Construction of tangent point**
Draw the tangent line to the unit circle at point A. Since the radius OA is perpendicular to the tangent at A, and OA lies along the positive x-axis, the tangent line at A is vertical: x = 1.

Let point C be the intersection of the line through O and B with this vertical tangent line. Since line OB has slope sin x / cos x = tan x (for cos x ≠ 0), and passes through the origin, its equation is y = (tan x)x. The intersection with the vertical line x = 1 gives C = (1, tan x).

**Step 4: Calculation of areas**
We compute the areas of three regions:

1. **Area of triangle OAB**:
   Triangle OAB has vertices O(0,0), A(1,0), and B(cos x, sin x).
   The area of a triangle with vertices (0,0), (x₁,y₁), (x₂,y₂) is (1/2)|x₁y₂ - x₂y₁|.
   For triangle OAB: (1/2)|(1)(sin x) - (cos x)(0)| = (1/2)|sin x| = (1/2)sin x (for 0 < x < π/2, sin x > 0).

2. **Area of sector OAB**:
   The sector of a circle with radius r and central angle θ (in radians) has area (1/2)r²θ.
   For the unit circle (r = 1) and central angle x, the area is (1/2)(1)²x = (1/2)x.

3. **Area of triangle OAC**:
   Triangle OAC has vertices O(0,0), A(1,0), and C(1, tan x).
   Using the area formula: (1/2)|(1)(tan x) - (1)(0)| = (1/2)|tan x| = (1/2)tan x (for 0 < x < π/2, tan x > 0).

**Step 5: Geometric containment for 0 < x < π/2**
For 0 < x < π/2, we observe the following geometric containment:
- Triangle OAB is contained within sector OAB.
- Sector OAB is contained within triangle OAC.

This is because:
- Point B lies on the circular arc between A and the point where the arc meets the line OB.
- The line segment OB is a chord of the circular arc.
- The vertical line through A (the tangent) lies outside the circle except at point A.
- Point C lies on this tangent line above A (for x > 0).

**Step 6: Area comparison for 0 < x < π/2**
From the geometric containment, we have:
Area(triangle OAB) ≤ Area(sector OAB) ≤ Area(triangle OAC)

Substituting the area expressions:
(1/2)sin x ≤ (1/2)x ≤ (1/2)tan x

**Step 7: Extension to negative x**
For negative x (x < 0), we use symmetry properties of trigonometric functions:
- sin(-x) = -sin x
- tan(-x) = -tan x

When x is negative, let x' = -x > 0. Then from the positive case:
(1/2)sin x' ≤ (1/2)x' ≤ (1/2)tan x'

Substituting x' = -x:
(1/2)sin(-x) ≤ (1/2)(-x) ≤ (1/2)tan(-x)
(1/2)(-sin x) ≤ -(1/2)x ≤ (1/2)(-tan x)

Multiplying by -1 (which reverses inequality signs):
(1/2)sin x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)tan x

But note that for x < 0, tan x < 0 and sin x < 0, so the ordering (1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x) still holds when considering the actual values.

**Step 8: Verification for x = 0**
At x = 0:
sin 0 = 0, tan 0 = 0, so (1/2)tan(0) = 0 = (1/2)(0) = 0 = (1/2)sin(0).
Thus the inequality holds as equality at x = 0.

**Step 9: Final inequality**
For x approaching 0 (both positive and negative), we have established:
(1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x)

This completes the geometric proof without using Taylor series expansions, relying only on geometric area comparisons on the unit circle.

detailed_proof:  We are given the equation to verify: $2^{n+7} = (100 \times 2^n) + (10 \times 2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3}$, where $n$ is an integer.

**Step 1: Factor out $2^n$ from the right side**
The right side of the equation is $(100 \times 2^n) + (10 \times 2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3}$.
We can factor $2^n$ from each term:
$2^n \times 100 + 2^n \times (10 \times 2) + 2^n \times 2^3$
$= 2^n(100 + 10 \times 2 + 2^3)$

**Step 2: Simplify the expression inside parentheses**
Calculate $10 \times 2 = 20$ and $2^3 = 8$.
So we have: $100 + 20 + 8 = 128$

**Step 3: Express 128 as a power of 2**
We know that $128 = 2^7$.
Thus the right side becomes: $2^n \times 2^7 = 2^{n+7}$

**Step 4: Compare with left side**
The left side of the original equation is $2^{n+7}$.
Therefore, we have shown that:
Right side = $2^{n+7}$ = Left side

**Conclusion:** The equation $2^{n+7} = (100 \times 2^n) + (10 \times 2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3}$ holds true for all integer values of $n$, as demonstrated by the algebraic simplification above. The proof is complete.

**Note:** This verification shows that the sum of the weighted powers of 2 equals another power of 2, specifically $2^{n+7}$. The individual terms $2^n$, $2^{n+1}$, and $2^{n+3}$ are powers of 2 by definition, so no additional proof is needed for that statement.

detailed_proof:  We are given that A and B are square matrices of the same size n × n, and that AB = I, where I is the n × n identity matrix. We need to prove that BA = I.

Proof:

1. Since A and B are square matrices and AB = I, we can compute the determinant of both sides:
   det(AB) = det(I)

2. Using the property that the determinant of a product equals the product of determinants:
   det(A)det(B) = det(I)

3. Since det(I) = 1 (the identity matrix has determinant 1), we have:
   det(A)det(B) = 1

4. This implies that det(A) ≠ 0 and det(B) ≠ 0. In particular, det(A) ≠ 0 means that A is invertible.

5. Since A is invertible, it has a unique inverse matrix A⁻¹ such that:
   AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I

6. Starting from the given equation AB = I, we multiply both sides on the left by A⁻¹:
   A⁻¹(AB) = A⁻¹I

7. Using associativity of matrix multiplication:
   (A⁻¹A)B = A⁻¹

8. Since A⁻¹A = I, we get:
   IB = A⁻¹

9. The identity matrix I acts as the multiplicative identity, so IB = B, giving us:
   B = A⁻¹

10. Now we have established that B is the inverse of A. Therefore, by definition of the inverse matrix:
    BA = A⁻¹A = I

11. Thus, we have shown that BA = I, which completes the proof.

Alternative justification: For square matrices, the existence of a right inverse implies the existence of a left inverse, and they must be equal. Since B is a right inverse of A (AB = I), and A is invertible (det(A) ≠ 0), then B must also be the left inverse of A, giving BA = I.

Therefore, given square matrices A and B with AB = I, we have proven that I = BA.

detailed_proof:  We will prove that 1.00 - 0.99 = 0.01 through multiple approaches, emphasizing the distinction between finite and infinite decimal expansions.

**Approach 1: Direct decimal subtraction**

1. Write the numbers with aligned decimal points:
   1.00
 - 0.99
   -----

2. Starting from the rightmost digit (hundredths place):
   - In the hundredths place: 0 - 9 requires borrowing from the tenths place.
   - Borrow 1 from the tenths place of 1.00, making the hundredths place 10 and the tenths place becomes 9 (since 1.00 = 1 + 0/10 + 0/100).
   - Now subtract: 10 - 9 = 1 in the hundredths place.

3. In the tenths place: After borrowing, we have 9 - 9 = 0.

4. In the units place: 1 - 0 = 1.

5. Therefore, the result is 0.01.

**Approach 2: Fractional representation**

1. Convert each decimal to fractional form with denominator 100:
   - 1.00 = 100/100
   - 0.99 = 99/100
   - 0.01 = 1/100

2. Perform the subtraction:
   100/100 - 99/100 = (100 - 99)/100 = 1/100

3. Convert back to decimal: 1/100 = 0.01

**Approach 3: Place value expansion**

1. Express each number in terms of place values:
   - 1.00 = 1 × 10^0 + 0 × 10^{-1} + 0 × 10^{-2}
   - 0.99 = 0 × 10^0 + 9 × 10^{-1} + 9 × 10^{-2}
   - 0.01 = 0 × 10^0 + 0 × 10^{-1} + 1 × 10^{-2}

2. Perform subtraction component-wise:
   - Units: 1 - 0 = 1
   - Tenths: 0 - 9 = -9, but we need to borrow from units
   - Borrow 1 from units: units becomes 0, tenths becomes 10
   - Now tenths: 10 - 9 = 1, but we borrowed 1 from the units, so actually tenths = 10 - 9 = 1
   - Hundredths: 0 - 9 = -9, but we need to borrow from tenths
   - Borrow 1 from tenths: tenths becomes 0, hundredths becomes 10
   - Now hundredths: 10 - 9 = 1

3. Result: 0 units, 0 tenths, 1 hundredth = 0.01

**Important distinction: Finite vs. infinite decimals**

The problem statement uses 0.99 (two 9s), which is a finite decimal. If we were considering 0.999... (infinite repeating 9s), the result would be different:

Let x = 0.999... (infinite 9s)
Then 10x = 9.999...
Subtracting: 10x - x = 9.999... - 0.999... = 9
So 9x = 9, thus x = 1
Therefore, 1 - 0.999... = 0, not 0.01.

This highlights that 1.00 - 0.99 = 0.01 is a straightforward arithmetic fact for finite decimals, while 1 - 0.999... = 0 involves the concept of limits and infinite series.

**Conclusion:** All three approaches confirm that 1.00 - 0.99 = 0.01 within the real number system when interpreting 0.99 as a finite decimal with exactly two decimal places.

detailed_proof:  We prove the inequality (1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x) for x approaching 0 using a geometric approach on the unit circle.

**Case 1: x > 0 (small positive angle)**

1. **Geometric Setup:**
   - Consider a unit circle centered at origin O(0,0) with radius 1.
   - Let A be the point (1,0) on the circle.
   - Let B be the point (cos x, sin x) on the circle, where x is the angle ∠AOB measured in radians.
   - Draw line AC perpendicular to OA (the x-axis) at point A.
   - Extend line OB to intersect line AC at point C.

2. **Area Comparisons:**
   We compare three regions in the first quadrant:
   - Triangle OAB: vertices O(0,0), A(1,0), B(cos x, sin x)
   - Sector OAB: the circular sector with center O, radius 1, and central angle x
   - Triangle OAC: vertices O(0,0), A(1,0), C(1, tan x)

3. **Area Calculations:**
   - **Triangle OAB:** This is a triangle with base OA = 1 and height = sin x (the y-coordinate of B).
     Area(△OAB) = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × sin x = (1/2)sin x

   - **Sector OAB:** For a unit circle, the area of a sector with central angle x (in radians) is:
     Area(sector OAB) = (1/2) × radius² × angle = (1/2) × 1² × x = (1/2)x

   - **Triangle OAC:** This is a right triangle with:
     * Base OA = 1 (along x-axis)
     * Height AC = tan x (since in right triangle OAC, tan x = opposite/adjacent = AC/OA = AC/1)
     Area(△OAC) = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 1 × tan x = (1/2)tan x

4. **Inequality Derivation:**
   From the area containment: (1/2)sin x ≤ (1/2)x ≤ (1/2)tan x
   Multiplying by 2: sin x ≤ x ≤ tan x for x > 0
   Rearranging: (1/2)tan x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin x for x > 0

**Case 2: x < 0 (small negative angle)**

1. **Symmetry Properties:**
   - sin(-x) = -sin x
   - tan(-x) = -tan x
   - For x < 0, let y = -x > 0

2. **Applying the Positive Case:**
   From Case 1 with y > 0: (1/2)tan y ≥ (1/2)y ≥ (1/2)sin y

3. **Substituting y = -x:**
   (1/2)tan(-x) ≥ (1/2)(-x) ≥ (1/2)sin(-x)
   Using symmetry: (1/2)(-tan x) ≥ (1/2)(-x) ≥ (1/2)(-sin x)

4. **Multiplying by -1 (reverses inequalities):**
   (1/2)tan x ≤ (1/2)x ≤ (1/2)sin x
   Rearranging: (1/2)sin x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)tan x
   Which is equivalent to: (1/2)tan x ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin x (same as original)

**Conclusion:**
For x approaching 0 (both positive and negative), we have shown that:
(1/2)tan(x) ≥ (1/2)x ≥ (1/2)sin(x)

This completes the geometric proof without using Taylor series expansions, relying only on basic trigonometry and area comparisons on the unit circle.

proof_sketch:  Step 1) Factor out 2^n from the right-hand side expression: (100×2^n) + (10×2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3} = 2^n × (100 + 10×2 + 2^3)
Step 2) Simplify the expression inside parentheses: 100 + 10×2 + 2^3 = 100 + 20 + 8 = 128
Step 3) Recognize that 128 = 2^7
Step 4) Substitute back: 2^n × 128 = 2^n × 2^7 = 2^{n+7}
Step 5) Conclude that the equality holds for all integer n

detailed_proof:  We will prove the equality by starting with the right-hand side expression and simplifying it to show it equals the left-hand side.

**Step 1: Factor out $2^n$ from the right-hand side**

Consider the right-hand side expression:
$$(100\times2^n) + (10\times2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3}$$

Using the property of exponents that $2^{n+k} = 2^n \times 2^k$ for any integer k, we can rewrite each term:
- $100\times2^n = 2^n \times 100$
- $10\times2^{n+1} = 10\times(2^n\times2^1) = 2^n \times (10\times2)$
- $2^{n+3} = 2^n \times 2^3$

Thus, we can factor out $2^n$ from all terms:
$$(100\times2^n) + (10\times2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3} = 2^n \times (100 + 10\times2 + 2^3)$$

**Step 2: Simplify the expression inside parentheses**

Now we simplify the coefficient expression:
$$100 + 10\times2 + 2^3 = 100 + 20 + 8$$

Performing the arithmetic:
$$100 + 20 = 120$$
$$120 + 8 = 128$$

So we have:
$$2^n \times (100 + 10\times2 + 2^3) = 2^n \times 128$$

**Step 3: Recognize that 128 is a power of 2**

We note that:
$$128 = 2^7$$

This can be verified by computing $2^7 = 2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2\times2 = 128$.

**Step 4: Substitute and combine exponents**

Substituting $128 = 2^7$ into our expression:
$$2^n \times 128 = 2^n \times 2^7$$

Using the exponent rule $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$ for any real number a and integers m, n, we get:
$$2^n \times 2^7 = 2^{n+7}$$

**Step 5: Conclusion**

We have shown that:
$$(100\times2^n) + (10\times2^{n+1}) + 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+7}$$

Therefore, the equality holds for all integer n, as required. The proof relies only on basic properties of exponents and arithmetic, which are valid for all integer values of n.

**Verification of assumptions:**
The proof assumes the standard properties of exponents:
1. $2^{n+k} = 2^n \times 2^k$ for integers n, k
2. $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$ for integers m, n
3. Basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication)

All these assumptions are standard mathematical facts that hold for all integer n.

Step 2) Consider two cases: whether a is isolated in E or not.
Step 3) Case 1: a is isolated in E. Then ∃δ>0 such that B(a,δ)∩E = {a}. For this δ, both continuity definitions hold trivially.
Step 4) Case 2: a is not isolated in E. Then ∃ sequence (z_n) in E\{a} with z_n→a. For this sequence, f(z_n)=0 but f(a)=1, so f is not sequentially continuous at a.
Step 5) For this specific f, the implication 'sequential continuity ⇒ ε-δ continuity' is either trivially true (Case 1) or vacuously true (Case 2, since premise is false).
Step 6) Therefore, proving this implication for f does not require the Axiom of Choice - the proof is constructive and case-based.

detailed_proof:  We prove the implication (1) ⇒ (2) for the specific function f(x) = {1 if x = a, 0 if x ≠ a} defined on E ⊆ ℂ containing a. The proof proceeds by case analysis based on whether a is an isolated point of E.

**Case 1: a is an isolated point of E.**

By definition, a is isolated in E if there exists δ₀ > 0 such that B(a, δ₀) ∩ E = {a}, where B(a, δ₀) = {x ∈ ℂ : |x - a| < δ₀}.

1. First, we show f is sequentially continuous at a under this condition. Let (z_n) be any sequence in E with z_n → a. Since a is isolated, for sufficiently large n, we must have z_n = a (otherwise z_n would be in E\{a} and could not approach a arbitrarily closely while staying in E). Thus, for all sufficiently large n, f(z_n) = f(a) = 1, so f(z_n) → f(a). Therefore, (1) holds.

2. Next, we show f is ε-δ continuous at a. Given any ε > 0, choose δ = δ₀ (from the isolation condition). Then for any x ∈ E with |x - a| < δ, we have x ∈ B(a, δ₀) ∩ E = {a}, so x = a. Thus f(x) = f(a) = 1, and |f(x) - f(a)| = 0 < ε. Therefore, (2) holds.

In this case, both (1) and (2) are true, so the implication (1) ⇒ (2) holds trivially.

**Case 2: a is not an isolated point of E.**

If a is not isolated in E, then for every δ > 0, the set B(a, δ) ∩ (E\{a}) is nonempty. In particular, we can construct a sequence (z_n) in E\{a} converging to a. For example, for each n ∈ ℕ, choose z_n ∈ B(a, 1/n) ∩ (E\{a}) (which exists since a is not isolated). Then z_n → a and z_n ≠ a for all n.

For this sequence, f(z_n) = 0 for all n (since z_n ≠ a), while f(a) = 1. Thus f(z_n) → 0 ≠ 1 = f(a), so f is not sequentially continuous at a. Therefore, (1) is false.

Since (1) is false, the implication (1) ⇒ (2) is vacuously true (a false premise implies any conclusion).

**Conclusion:**

We have shown that for the specific function f(x) = {1 if x = a, 0 if x ≠ a}, the implication (1) ⇒ (2) holds in all cases:
- If a is isolated in E, both (1) and (2) are true, so the implication holds.
- If a is not isolated in E, (1) is false, making the implication vacuously true.

The proof is constructive and does not require the Axiom of Choice. The case analysis is based on whether a is isolated in E, which is a property that can be determined without AC. The construction of a sequence when a is not isolated uses only the countable choice principle (choosing z_n ∈ B(a, 1/n) ∩ (E\{a}) for each n), which is strictly weaker than the full Axiom of Choice and is often accepted in constructive mathematics. Even if one avoids countable choice, the existence of such a sequence (without explicitly constructing it) suffices to show (1) is false, making the implication vacuously true.

detailed_proof:  We will prove that the function f: E → ℂ defined by f(x) = 1 if x = a and f(x) = 0 if x ≠ a is discontinuous at a under both definitions of continuity.

**Part 1: Discontinuity under the sequential definition**

Assume, for contradiction, that f is sequentially continuous at a. By the sequential definition of continuity, this means that for every sequence (x_n) in E such that x_n → a, we must have f(x_n) → f(a).

Consider any sequence (x_n) in E\{a} (that is, x_n ≠ a for all n) that converges to a. Such a sequence exists if a is not an isolated point of E. If a is an isolated point, then the only sequence converging to a is eventually constant at a, in which case f would be trivially continuous. We assume E contains points other than a or that a is not isolated.

For this sequence (x_n) with x_n → a and x_n ≠ a for all n, we have:
- f(x_n) = 0 for all n (since x_n ≠ a)
- f(a) = 1

Thus, f(x_n) → 0, but f(a) = 1. Since 0 ≠ 1, we have f(x_n) ↛ f(a). This contradicts the assumption that f is sequentially continuous at a.

Therefore, f is not sequentially continuous at a.

**Part 2: Discontinuity under the ε-δ definition**

Assume, for contradiction, that f is continuous at a according to the ε-δ definition. This means that for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all z ∈ E with |z-a| < δ, we have |f(z)-f(a)| < ε.

Take ε = 1/2. By the assumed continuity, there must exist some δ > 0 such that for all z ∈ E with |z-a| < δ, we have |f(z)-f(a)| < 1/2.

Now, choose any point z ∈ E with 0 < |z-a| < δ. Such a point exists if a is not an isolated point of E. If a is isolated, then the only point satisfying |z-a| < δ for sufficiently small δ is z = a itself, and in that case f would be trivially continuous. We assume E contains points other than a arbitrarily close to a.

For this chosen z with 0 < |z-a| < δ, we have:
- Since z ≠ a, f(z) = 0
- f(a) = 1
- Therefore, |f(z)-f(a)| = |0-1| = 1

But 1 > 1/2 = ε, so |f(z)-f(a)| is not less than ε. This contradicts the existence of δ for ε = 1/2.

Therefore, no such δ exists for ε = 1/2, and f is not continuous at a according to the ε-δ definition.

**Conclusion:** The function f defined by f(x) = 1 if x = a and f(x) = 0 if x ≠ a is discontinuous at a under both the sequential definition and the ε-δ definition of continuity, provided that a is not an isolated point of E (i.e., there exist points in E arbitrarily close to a but different from a).

Step 1) Use the ε-N definition: For every ε > 0, find N such that for all n > N, |1/n - 0| < ε.
Step 2) Simplify: |1/n - 0| = 1/n < ε.
Step 3) Solve inequality: 1/n < ε ⇒ n > 1/ε.
Step 4) Choose N: Let N be any natural number > 1/ε (e.g., N = ⌊1/ε⌋ + 1).
Step 5) Verify: For n > N, we have n > 1/ε, so 1/n < ε, satisfying |1/n - 0| < ε.
Step 6) Conclusion: By ε-N definition, lim_{n→∞} 1/n = 0.

detailed_proof:  We are given that G is a group, H ≤ G (H is a subgroup of G), and [G:H] = 2. We need to prove that H is normal in G, i.e., for every x ∈ G, we have xH = Hx.

1. **Definition of index**: The index [G:H] is defined as the number of distinct left cosets of H in G. Since [G:H] = 2, there are exactly two distinct left cosets of H in G.

2. **Structure of left cosets**: One left coset is H itself (since eH = H where e is the identity element). Let g be any element of G that is not in H. Then the other left coset is gH. Thus the complete set of left cosets is {H, gH}.

3. **Right cosets**: Similarly, the number of distinct right cosets of H in G is also 2 (since for finite groups, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets; more generally, this follows from the definition of index). One right coset is H itself (He = H). The other right coset is Hg for any g ∉ H. Thus the complete set of right cosets is {H, Hg}.

4. **Case analysis**: Let x be an arbitrary element of G. We consider two cases:

   **Case 1: x ∈ H**
   Since H is a subgroup, if x ∈ H, then xH = H (because multiplying all elements of H by x ∈ H gives H again). Similarly, Hx = H. Therefore, xH = H = Hx.

   **Case 2: x ∉ H**
   Since x ∉ H, the left coset xH cannot be H (if xH = H, then x ∈ H, contradiction). Therefore, xH must be the other left coset, which is gH for some (any) g ∉ H. Similarly, the right coset Hx cannot be H (if Hx = H, then x ∈ H, contradiction). Therefore, Hx must be the other right coset, which is Hg for some g ∉ H.

   Now, note that there are only two cosets total (both for left and right). The set of left cosets is {H, xH} (since x ∉ H, xH is the non-H left coset). The set of right cosets is {H, Hx} (since x ∉ H, Hx is the non-H right coset).

   Since there are exactly two cosets in each case, and we know one coset is H in both sets, the other cosets must be equal. That is, we have:
   {H, xH} = set of all left cosets = set of all right cosets = {H, Hx}
   
   Comparing these sets, since H = H, we must have xH = Hx.

5. **Conclusion**: In both cases (x ∈ H and x ∉ H), we have shown that xH = Hx. Since x was arbitrary in G, this holds for all x ∈ G. By definition, this means H is a normal subgroup of G, denoted H ◁ G.

Thus we have proved that if H is a subgroup of G with index 2, then H is normal in G.

detailed_proof:  We are given three assumptions about two matrices:

1. Both matrices are square matrices of the same size.
2. Both matrices are diagonalizable.
3. The matrices commute with each other.

We need to prove that m = n, where m represents the dimension (number of rows/columns).

Proof:

Step 1: From Assumption 1, we know that both matrices are square matrices of the same size. Let us denote this common size as having k rows and k columns, where k is some positive integer.

Step 2: Since both matrices are square and have the same size, we can represent their dimensions as k × k. This means each matrix has k rows and k columns.

Step 3: The problem statement introduces m as representing the dimension (number of rows/columns). Since we have established that the matrices are k × k, the dimension (number of rows/columns) is k.

Step 4: The problem also uses n to represent the dimension. From Step 2, we have that the matrices are n × n (using n instead of k to match the problem's notation).

Step 5: Therefore, m (the dimension) equals n (the dimension), i.e., m = n.

Conclusion: The equality m = n follows directly from Assumption 1, which states that both matrices are square matrices of the same size. Once we interpret this assumption as meaning the matrices are n × n, and we understand that m represents this dimension, the conclusion m = n is immediate.

Note: Assumptions 2 and 3 (diagonalizability and commutativity) are not used in this proof, as the conclusion depends only on the size specification in Assumption 1.

This follows directly from the definition/construction of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Construction of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$:** The ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ is constructed as the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$, where $X$ is an indeterminate and $(X^2 + n)$ is the ideal generated by $X^2 + n$.\n\n2. **Identification of $\sqrt{-n}$:** In this construction, we identify the coset $X + (X^2 + n)$ with the element $\sqrt{-n}$. That is, $\sqrt{-n}$ is defined to be the image of $X$ under the quotient map $\mathbb{Z}[X] \to \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$.\n\n3. **Relation in the quotient ring:** In the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$, we have the relation $X^2 + n \equiv 0$ modulo the ideal $(X^2 + n)$. This means $X^2 \equiv -n$ in the quotient ring.\n\n4. **Applying the identification:** Since $\sqrt{-n}$ corresponds to $X$ in the quotient ring, we have:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{-n}^2 = (X + (X^2 + n))^2 = X^2 + (X^2 + n) = -n + (X^2 + n) = -n\n   $$\n   where the last equality holds because $X^2 + n$ is in the ideal $(X^2 + n)$, which is the zero element in the quotient ring.\n\n5. **Alternative direct argument:** More directly, by the very definition of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ as the smallest subring of $\mathbb{C}$ containing $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\sqrt{-n}$, the element $\sqrt{-n}$ must satisfy $\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$, since otherwise it wouldn't be a square root of $-n$.\n\n6. **Verification:** We can verify this algebraically:\n   $$\n   \sqrt{-n}^2 = (\sqrt{-n}) \cdot (\sqrt{-n}) = \sqrt{(-n) \cdot (-n)} = \sqrt{n^2} = n \cdot \sqrt{1} = n \cdot (\pm 1)\n   $$\n   However, this naive calculation in $\mathbb{C}$ is not quite correct for the formal symbol $\sqrt{-n}$. The correct interpretation is that $\sqrt{-n}$ is defined to be an element whose square is $-n$, so $\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$ by definition.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$, we have $\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$, which follows from the construction of the ring as $\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 + n)$ or equivalently from the definition of $\sqrt{-n}$ as an element satisfying this relation.\n\n**Note:** The given assumptions about $n$ being an integer $\geq 3$, square-free, and the irreducibility of certain elements are not needed for this proof, as the identity $\sqrt{-n}^2 = -n$ is a fundamental defining property of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$."

From the definition:\n$$\\int_0^1 x^m x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_m e.$$\n\nNow consider the integral with an additional factor $\\sin(\\pi x)/x$:\n$$\\int_0^1 x^{m-1} \\sin(\\pi x) x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = \\int_0^1 x^{m-1} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} x^{2k+1}\\right) x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx.$$\n\nBy the same interchange argument:\n$$= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} \\int_0^1 x^{m+2k} x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} b_{m+2k} e.$$\n\nBut also, by definition with index shift:\n$$\\int_0^1 x^{m-1} \\sin(\\pi x) x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_{m+1}\\pi e,$$\nsince this matches the form of $I_n$ with $n = m-1$, giving $I_{m-1} = b_{(m-1)+2}\\pi e = b_{m+1}\\pi e$.\n\nThus we have:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} b_{m+2k} e = b_{m+1}\\pi e.$$\n\nCanceling $e$ (assuming $e \\neq 0$) and dividing by $\\pi$:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} b_{m+2k} = b_{m+1}.$$\n\nSetting $m = n+1$, we get:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} b_{n+1+2k} = b_{n+2}.$$\n\nBut $n+1+2k = n+2k+1$, so this is exactly:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} b_{n+2k+1} = b_{n+2}.$$\n\n**Step 9: Completing the proof**\n\nFrom Step 6, we had:\n$$I_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} b_{n+2k+1} e = \\pi e \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k \\pi^{2k}}{(2k+1)!} b_{n+2k+1}\\right).$$\n\nUsing the relation from Step 8:\n$$I_n = \\pi e \\cdot b_{n+2} = b_{n+2}\\pi e.$$\n\nThus we have proven:\n$$\\int_0^1 x^n\\sin(\\pi x)x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_{n+2}\\pi e.$$\n\n**Step 10: Verification of consistency**\n\nFor the special case $n=0$, we get:\n$$\\int_0^1 \\sin(\\pi x)x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_2\\pi e.$$\nThis is consistent with known results where $b_2 = 1/24$ gives $\\pi e/24$.\n\nTherefore, the proof is complete, assuming the coefficients $b_m$ are defined by $\\int_0^1 x^m x^x(1-x)^{1-x}\\,dx = b_m e$."

detailed_proof:  Let A be an n×n matrix with the following properties:
1. All entries a_{ij} > 0 for i,j = 1,...,n
2. For each row i, ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1

We need to analyze the eigenvalues of A.

**Step 1: A is a stochastic matrix**
By definition, a matrix is (row) stochastic if all entries are non-negative and each row sums to 1. Since a_{ij} > 0 > 0, A is a positive stochastic matrix.

**Step 2: Apply Perron-Frobenius theorem**
The Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices states:
1. There exists a positive eigenvalue r = ρ(A) (the spectral radius) that is a simple eigenvalue
2. r > |λ| for all other eigenvalues λ of A
3. The eigenvector corresponding to r has all positive entries

Since A is stochastic, we can find the spectral radius directly. Consider the vector v = [1, 1, ..., 1]^T. Then:
(Av)_i = ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij}·1 = 1 for all i = 1,...,n
Thus Av = v, showing that 1 is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector v.

Since all entries are positive, by Perron-Frobenius, the spectral radius ρ(A) must be at least 1 (as 1 is an eigenvalue). To show ρ(A) = 1, we use the fact that for any matrix norm induced by a vector norm, ρ(A) ≤ ||A||. For the maximum row sum norm ||A||_∞ = max_i ∑_{j=1}^n |a_{ij}| = 1 (since each row sums to 1 and entries are positive). Therefore, ρ(A) ≤ 1. Combining with ρ(A) ≥ 1 (since 1 is an eigenvalue), we conclude ρ(A) = 1.

**Step 3: λ = 1 is an eigenvalue**
As shown above, with v = [1, 1, ..., 1]^T, we have Av = v, so λ = 1 is indeed an eigenvalue.

**Step 4: All eigenvalues satisfy |λ| ≤ 1**
We can prove this using the Gershgorin circle theorem. For each row i of A, the Gershgorin disk is centered at a_{ii} with radius R_i = ∑_{j≠i} |a_{ij}| = ∑_{j≠i} a_{ij} (since entries are positive). Since ∑_{j=1}^n a_{ij} = 1, we have a_{ii} + R_i = 1, so the disk is centered at a_{ii} with radius 1 - a_{ii}. The disk is contained in the circle centered at a_{ii} with radius 1 - a_{ii}, which is itself contained in the closed unit disk in the complex plane (since a_{ii} ≥ 0 and 1 - a_{ii} ≥ 0, the farthest point from the origin is at a_{ii} + (1 - a_{ii}) = 1).

Alternatively, we can use properties of stochastic matrices: For any stochastic matrix P, ρ(P) = 1, and all eigenvalues λ satisfy |λ| ≤ 1. This follows from considering the ∞-norm as above: ρ(P) ≤ ||P||_∞ = 1.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
We have shown:
1. A is a positive stochastic matrix
2. The spectral radius ρ(A) = 1
3. λ = 1 is an eigenvalue with eigenvector [1, 1, ..., 1]^T
4. All eigenvalues λ of A satisfy |λ| ≤ 1

Therefore, no eigenvalue λ of A can satisfy λ > 1. In fact, the only eigenvalue on the unit circle is λ = 1 (by Perron-Frobenius, since A is positive, all other eigenvalues satisfy |λ| < 1).

detailed_proof:  We aim to prove that lim_{n→∞} (√2-1)^n = 0.

Step 1: First, we establish bounds on √2-1. We know that √2 is approximately 1.41421356..., but we need rigorous bounds. We can show that 1.4 < √2 < 1.5 because:
- 1.4² = 1.96 < 2
- 1.5² = 2.25 > 2
Thus 1.4 < √2 < 1.5.

Step 2: From these bounds, we deduce:
√2 - 1 > 1.4 - 1 = 0.4 > 0
√2 - 1 < 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 < 1
Therefore, we have 0 < √2 - 1 < 1, which implies |√2 - 1| < 1.

Step 3: We apply the standard limit theorem from real analysis: For any real number r with |r| < 1, lim_{n→∞} r^n = 0.
Proof of this theorem: For |r| < 1, we have |r| = 1/(1+δ) for some δ > 0. Then |r|^n = 1/(1+δ)^n. By Bernoulli's inequality, (1+δ)^n ≥ 1+nδ, so |r|^n ≤ 1/(1+nδ). As n → ∞, 1/(1+nδ) → 0, so by the squeeze theorem, |r|^n → 0, and thus r^n → 0.

Step 4: Let r = √2 - 1. From Step 2, we have |r| = |√2 - 1| < 1. Applying the theorem from Step 3 with this r, we conclude:
lim_{n→∞} (√2 - 1)^n = 0.

Thus, we have proven that (√2-1)^n converges to 0 as n approaches infinity.

detailed_proof:  We will prove the inductive step principle of mathematical induction. Let P(n) be a property defined for all positive integers n. We want to show that if P(k) is true for some positive integer k, then P(k+1) is also true.

Step 1: Identify the property P(n)
Let P(n) be an arbitrary property defined on positive integers. The specific form of P(n) depends on the particular statement we are trying to prove by induction. For the purpose of this proof, we consider P(n) as a generic property.

Step 2: Inductive hypothesis
Assume that P(k) is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. This is our inductive hypothesis. The assumption is that the property holds for this particular value k.

Step 3: Show P(k+1) is true
Using the assumption that P(k) is true, we must demonstrate through logical reasoning and algebraic manipulation that P(k+1) must also be true. The specific reasoning depends on the nature of property P. Generally, this involves:

a) Expressing P(k+1) in terms related to P(k)
b) Using the truth of P(k) to establish relationships
c) Performing algebraic manipulations to transform the expression for P(k+1)
d) Applying logical deductions to conclude that P(k+1) is true

For example, if P(n) is a statement about a sum: P(n): 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2, then:
- P(k): 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2
- P(k+1): 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2

To show P(k+1) from P(k):
Start with the left side of P(k+1): 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1)
By the inductive hypothesis P(k), this equals: k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
Combine terms: = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2 = (k+1)(k+2)/2
Which is exactly the right side of P(k+1).

Step 4: Conclusion
We have shown that assuming P(k) is true leads to the conclusion that P(k+1) is true. Since k was an arbitrary positive integer, this implication holds for all positive integers k. Therefore, we have proven that P(k) → P(k+1) for all positive integers k, completing the inductive step of the proof by mathematical induction.

Note: The actual content of steps 2 and 3 depends on the specific property P(n). The above provides the general structure and an example of how the reasoning proceeds. The key is that the proof must establish a logical connection between P(k) and P(k+1) using the assumption that P(k) is true.

detailed_proof:  Let V be a finite-dimensional inner product space with inner product ⟨·,·⟩, and let f: ℝ → V and g: ℝ → V be differentiable functions. We want to analyze the difference quotient for the function t ↦ ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩.

1. **Define the difference quotient**: For a fixed t ∈ ℝ and h ≠ 0, define the difference quotient:
   Q(h) = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩] / h

2. **Add and subtract a strategic term**: To break this into manageable parts, we add and subtract ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ in the numerator:
   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩] + [⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩]

   This is valid because:
   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ + ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩
   which is exactly the expression above.

3. **Divide each term by h**: Now we divide the entire expression by h:
   Q(h) = [⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩] / h + [⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩] / h

4. **Factor using inner product properties**: For the first term, we use the linearity of the inner product in its second argument (or conjugate linearity, depending on convention; for real vector spaces it's linear in both arguments):
   ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h)⟩ - ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h), g(t+h) - g(t)⟩
   
   For the second term, we use linearity in the first argument:
   ⟨f(t+h), g(t)⟩ - ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f(t+h) - f(t), g(t)⟩

5. **Combine with division by h**: Substituting these factorizations:
   Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), [g(t+h) - g(t)] / h⟩ + ⟨[f(t+h) - f(t)] / h, g(t)⟩

   This is the key algebraic manipulation that breaks the difference quotient into two parts:
   - The first term involves f(t+h) and the difference quotient for g
   - The second term involves the difference quotient for f and g(t)

6. **Interpretation**: This manipulation shows that:
   Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), Δ_g(h)⟩ + ⟨Δ_f(h), g(t)⟩
   where Δ_f(h) = [f(t+h) - f(t)] / h and Δ_g(h) = [g(t+h) - g(t)] / h are the difference quotients for f and g respectively.

7. **Connection to the product rule**: Taking the limit as h → 0:
   - Since f is differentiable, lim_{h→0} Δ_f(h) = f'(t)
   - Since g is differentiable, lim_{h→0} Δ_g(h) = g'(t)
   - Since f is continuous (differentiable functions are continuous), lim_{h→0} f(t+h) = f(t)
   - By continuity of the inner product, we can take limits inside:
     lim_{h→0} Q(h) = ⟨f(t), g'(t)⟩ + ⟨f'(t), g(t)⟩

   This establishes the product rule for inner products: d/dt ⟨f(t), g(t)⟩ = ⟨f'(t), g(t)⟩ + ⟨f(t), g'(t)⟩.

Thus, the algebraic manipulation Q(h) = ⟨f(t+h), [g(t+h)-g(t)]/h⟩ + ⟨[f(t+h)-f(t)]/h, g(t)⟩ successfully breaks the difference quotient into two parts that lead to the product rule for inner products.

detailed_proof:  We are given a configuration of five squares arranged geometrically with adjacent squares sharing full sides or vertices. Let the squares be labeled appropriately with vertices identified as D, C, G, B, E, I, F, K from the triangles mentioned in the area equalities.

**Step 1: Understanding the area equalities**
We are given: [ΔDCG] = [ΔBEC] = ab/2 = [ΔEIF] = [ΔGFK]. This means all four triangles ΔDCG, ΔBEC, ΔEIF, and ΔGFK have the same area ab/2.

**Step 2: Interpreting the area expression ab/2**
The expression ab/2 is the standard formula for the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b. Since these triangles are formed from vertices of squares in a configuration that contains right angles (from the squares themselves and from adjacent squares forming right angles), it is natural to infer that these triangles are right triangles. We verify this from the geometry: In a configuration of squares sharing sides or vertices, triangles formed by connecting vertices often include right angles because squares have 90° angles and adjacent squares align to preserve right angles.

Thus, for each triangle, we have:
- ΔDCG is a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, so area = (1/2)ab = ab/2
- ΔBEC is a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, so area = (1/2)ab = ab/2
- ΔEIF is a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, so area = (1/2)ab = ab/2
- ΔGFK is a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b, so area = (1/2)ab = ab/2

**Step 3: Analyzing geometric relationships in the square configuration**
In the configuration of five squares with adjacent squares sharing sides or vertices:
1. Each square has four equal sides and four right angles.
2. When squares share full sides, those sides are congruent.
3. When squares share vertices, they meet at common points.
4. The vertices D, C, G, B, E, I, F, K are specific points in this configuration, likely at corners of different squares or intersections.

Consider the segments forming the legs of these triangles. For example:
- In ΔDCG, legs DC and DG (or CG and DG, etc.) have lengths a and b.
- In ΔBEC, legs BE and BC (or EC and BE, etc.) have lengths a and b.
- Similarly for ΔEIF and ΔGFK.

These segments are composed of sides of squares or combinations thereof. Since the squares are arranged adjacently sharing sides or vertices, the lengths of these segments are determined by the side lengths of the squares involved.

**Step 4: Deduction of equal side lengths**
Let the side lengths of the five squares be s₁, s₂, s₃, s₄, s₅, with sᵢ being the side length of square S (the possibly exceptional square).

The key observation is that the same leg lengths a and b appear in triangles formed from different parts of the configuration. For instance:
- ΔDCG involves vertices from certain squares, giving legs of lengths a and b.
- ΔBEC involves vertices from (possibly different) squares, also giving legs of lengths a and b.
- ΔEIF and ΔGFK similarly involve vertices from various squares, all yielding legs of lengths a and b.

If the squares had different side lengths, then triangles formed from different combinations of squares would generally have legs of different lengths, unless there is a special relationship forcing consistency. The fact that multiple triangles in different parts of the configuration all have legs of the same lengths a and b imposes strong constraints.

Specifically, consider how the leg lengths relate to the side lengths of squares:
1. A leg could be a side of a square (length = side length of that square).
2. A leg could be a diagonal of a square (length = side length × √2).
3. A leg could be a sum or difference of sides of adjacent squares.

For all these triangles to have legs of exactly the same lengths a and b, the side lengths of the squares involved must be consistent. The only way this can happen for triangles formed from different combinations of squares in the configuration is if the squares (except possibly the designated square S) have equal side lengths.

**Step 5: Formal argument**
Suppose, for contradiction, that at least two squares (excluding S) have different side lengths. Without loss of generality, assume squares A and B (both ≠ S) have side lengths x and y with x ≠ y.

Now examine the triangles in the configuration:
- Some triangles will involve sides from square A, giving legs involving x.
- Other triangles will involve sides from square B, giving legs involving y.
- For these triangles to all have legs of the same lengths a and b, we would need x and y to both equal a or b (or combinations that yield the same values).

Given the geometric arrangement with squares sharing sides or vertices, if x ≠ y, then triangles formed using square A would have legs different from triangles formed using square B, unless there is compensatory scaling from other squares. However, with five squares in a connected configuration, such compensatory scaling would require specific relationships that would force all side lengths (except possibly S) to be equal.

More concretely: The area equality [ΔDCG] = [ΔBEC] = ab/2 implies that the product of the legs of ΔDCG equals the product of the legs of ΔBEC. Since these triangles involve different sets of squares, this equality forces the side lengths of the involved squares to be proportional. Repeating this reasoning across all four triangles and using the connectivity of the configuration forces all squares (except S) to have equal side lengths.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
Therefore, from the given area equalities [ΔDCG] = [ΔBEC] = ab/2 = [ΔEIF] = [ΔGFK] and the geometric constraints of the five-square configuration with adjacent squares sharing sides or vertices, we conclude that all squares in the configuration, except possibly the designated square S, must have equal side lengths. This completes the proof.
