The complete calculation shows that summing all such contributions gives $-t \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{kk} = -t \\cdot \\text{tr}(A)$, plus terms that don't involve $t^{n-1}$. More systematically, one can observe that $p(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, and by comparing $p(t)$ with $\\det(-tI) = (-t)^n$, we can use multilinearity of the determinant to extract the linear term in the entries of $A$, which yields $-\\text{tr}(A)$ as the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$.\n\nThus, in either approach, we conclude that the coefficient of $t^{n-1}$ in $\\det(A - tI)$ is $-\\text{tr}(A)$.\n"

This happens only when we select all the diagonal entries, which corresponds to the identity permutation \\(\\sigma = \\text{id}\\). For this permutation, \\(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\text{id}) = 1\\). The product is:\n    \\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n (t - a_{ii}) = (t - a_{11})(t - a_{22})\\cdots(t - a_{nn}) \\]\n    Expanding this product gives \\(t^n - (a_{11} + a_{22} + \\cdots + a_{nn})t^{n-1} + \\cdots\\).\n\n2.  **Terms of degree \\(n-1\\):** Let's consider any other permutation \\(\\sigma \\neq \\text{id}\\). Such a permutation must have at least two indices \\(i\\) for which \\(\\sigma(i) \\neq i\\). This means that in the product \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n b_{i, \\sigma(i)}\\), at least two factors will be off-diagonal elements (\\(-a_{ij}\\) where \\(i \\neq j\\)), which do not contain \\(t\\). Therefore, the product will contain at most \\(n-2\\) factors from the diagonal, and its degree in \\(t\\) will be at most \\(n-2\\).\n\nCombining these observations, the terms of degree \\(n\\) and \\(n-1\\) in the characteristic polynomial are determined solely by the product of the diagonal elements.\n\\[ p(t) = (t - a_{11})(t - a_{22})\\cdots(t - a_{nn}) + (\\text{terms of degree } \\le n-2) \\]\n\\[ p(t) = t^n - (a_{11} + a_{22} + \\cdots + a_{nn})t^{n-1} + (\\text{terms of degree } \\le n-2) \\]\nThe trace of \\(A\\) is \\(\\operatorname{tr}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}\\).\nThus, the coefficient of \\(t^{n-1}\\) is \\(-\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} = -\\operatorname{tr}(A)\\).\n\n**Method 2: Using Eigenvalues**\n\nAssume the field \\(F\\) is algebraically closed. The roots of the characteristic polynomial \\(p(t)\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\), denoted \\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n\\).\nSince the leading term of \\(p(t) = \\det(tI - A)\\) is \\(t^n\\), the polynomial is monic. We can write \\(p(t)\\) in factored form:\n\\[ p(t) = (t - \\lambda_1)(t - \\lambda_2)\\cdots(t - \\lambda_n) \\]\nExpanding this product, by Vieta's formulas, the coefficient of the \\(t^{n-1}\\) term is the negative of the sum of the roots:\n\\[ -(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\cdots + \\lambda_n) \\]\nA fundamental property of matrices is that the sum of the eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i = \\operatorname{tr}(A)\\).\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(t^{n-1}\\) is \\(-\\operatorname{tr}(A)\\).\n\nBoth methods confirm the same result.\n\nfinal:Let \\(A\\) be an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. The coefficient of \\(t^{n-1}\\) in the characteristic polynomial \\(p(t) = \\det(tI - A)\\) is \\(-\\operatorname{tr}(A)\\)."

But if $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$, then properly:\n$$I^2 = \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx\\right)^2 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x^2+y^2)} dx dy$$\nThis is only the first quadrant. To get the full circle, we need $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(x^2+y^2)} dx dy$.\n\nActually, the assumption as written has $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}$ which suggests full angular integration, but $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}$ for radius. This corresponds to the first quadrant only if we interpret it carefully.\n\nLet $J = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$.

Assume response time is directly proportional to travel distance.\n\n2.  **The \"Closest-Ambulance\" Policy (Myopic Strategy):**\n    This policy mandates that for any incident, the geographically closest available ambulance is dispatched to minimize the immediate response time.\n\n3.  **An Alternative \"Coverage-Aware\" Strategy:**\n    This policy considers future system needs. For some incidents on the right side, it might dispatch an ambulance from the left side (`x=0`) to preserve coverage on the right.\n\n4.  **Critical Scenario and Comparison:**\n    Consider a scenario where two incidents occur in quick succession before the first dispatched ambulance can become available again.\n    *   **Incident 1:** Occurs at `x = 0.75L`.\n    *   **Incident 2:** Occurs at `x = L`.\n\n    **Case 1: Applying the Closest-Ambulance Policy**\n    *   For Incident 1 at `0.75L`, the closest ambulance is C (stationed at `L`).\n        *   Distance for C to travel: `L - 0.75L = 0.25L`.\n        *   Ambulance C is now dispatched, leaving the right side of the area uncovered.\n    *   For Incident 2 at `L`, ambulance C is unavailable. The next closest ambulance must be dispatched from `x=0` (either A or B).\n        *   Distance for A or B to travel: `L - 0 = L`.\n    *   **Total distance traveled (proportional to total response time): `0.25L + L = 1.25L`**.\n\n    **Case 2: Applying the Alternative Coverage-Aware Policy**\n    *   For Incident 1 at `0.75L`, the policy strategically dispatches ambulance B from `x=0`, even though it is further than C. This is done to keep C in position to cover the right side.\n        *   Distance for B to travel: `0.75L - 0 = 0.75L`.\n        *   Ambulance C remains available at `x=L`.\n    *   For Incident 2 at `L`, the locally stationed ambulance C is available.\n        *   Distance for C to travel: `L - L = 0`.\n    *   **Total distance traveled: `0.75L + 0 = 0.75L`**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    In this scenario, the total response time under the coverage-aware policy (proportional to `0.75L`) is significantly less than the total response time under the myopic closest-ambulance policy (proportional to `1.25L`). By accepting a longer response time for the first incident, the alternative strategy preserves system integrity and provides a much faster response for the second incident, leading to a better overall average.\n\n    Therefore, the policy of always dispatching the closest ambulance is not optimal for minimizing average system-wide response time because it myopically focuses on the current incident at the expense of maintaining strategic coverage for future incidents.\n\nfinal:Prove that dispatching the closest available ambulance to an emergency incident is not always the optimal strategy for minimizing the average system-wide response time."

If `f` is a measurable function on `X` such that `f ∈ L^∞(X)`, prove that `lim_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p = \\|f\\|_∞`.\n\n**Proof**\n\nFirst, we verify that `\\|f\\|_p` is well-defined for all `p ≥ 1`. Since `f ∈ L^∞(X)`, there exists a constant `M = \\|f\\|_∞` such that `|f(x)| ≤ M` for almost every `x ∈ X`. Then, for any `p ≥ 1`, we have:\n`∫_X |f(x)|^p dμ ≤ ∫_X M^p dμ = M^p μ(X)`\nSince `M` and `μ(X)` are finite, the integral is finite, which implies `f ∈ L^p(X)` for all `p ≥ 1`.\n\nThe proof proceeds by establishing upper and lower bounds for `\\|f\\|_p`.\n\n**1. Upper Bound**\n\nFrom the definition of the essential supremum `\\|f\\|_∞`, we know that `|f(x)| ≤ \\|f\\|_∞` almost everywhere. Therefore, for any `p ≥ 1`:\n`\\|f\\|_p = (∫_X |f(x)|^p dμ)^{1/p} ≤ (∫_X \\|f\\|_∞^p dμ)^{1/p}`\n`= (\\|f\\|_∞^p μ(X))^{1/p} = \\|f\\|_∞ (μ(X))^{1/p}`\n\nNow, we take the limit as `p → ∞`. Since `μ(X)` is a finite positive constant, `lim_{p→∞} (μ(X))^{1/p} = 1`.\nThus, we have:\n`limsup_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≤ \\|f\\|_∞`\n\n**2. Lower Bound**\n\nLet `\\|f\\|_∞ > 0`. By the definition of the essential supremum, for any `δ > 0` such that `\\|f\\|_∞ - δ > 0`, the set `S_δ = {x ∈ X : |f(x)| > \\|f\\|_∞ - δ}` must have a positive measure, i.e., `μ(S_δ) > 0`.\n\nNow, we can bound the `L^p` norm from below:\n`\\|f\\|_p^p = ∫_X |f(x)|^p dμ ≥ ∫_{S_δ} |f(x)|^p dμ`\nOn the set `S_δ`, we have `|f(x)| > \\|f\\|_∞ - δ`. Therefore:\n`∫_{S_δ} |f(x)|^p dμ > ∫_{S_δ} (\\|f\\|_∞ - δ)^p dμ = (\\|f\\|_∞ - δ)^p μ(S_δ)`\n\nTaking the `p`-th root of both sides gives:\n`\\|f\\|_p > (\\|f\\|_∞ - δ) (μ(S_δ))^{1/p}`\n\nAs `p → ∞`, since `μ(S_δ)` is a finite positive constant, `lim_{p→∞} (μ(S_δ))^{1/p} = 1`.\nThis implies:\n`liminf_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≥ \\|f\\|_∞ - δ`\n\nSince this inequality holds for any arbitrarily small `δ > 0`, we can conclude:\n`liminf_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≥ \\|f\\|_∞`\n(If `\\|f\\|_∞ = 0`, the result is trivial).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have:\n`\\|f\\|_∞ ≤ liminf_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≤ limsup_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≤ \\|f\\|_∞`\n\nThis forces the limit inferior and limit superior to be equal. Therefore, the limit exists and is equal to `\\|f\\|_∞`.\n\n`lim_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p = \\|f\\|_∞`\n\nproof:Let `(X, M, μ)` be a finite measure space. If `f` is a measurable function on `X` and `f ∈ L^∞(X)`, prove that `lim_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p = \\|f\\|_∞`.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nFirst, since `f ∈ L^∞(X)` and `μ(X) < ∞`, `f ∈ L^p(X)` for all `p ≥ 1` because `∫|f|^p dμ ≤ \\|f\\|_∞^p μ(X) < ∞`.\n\n1.  **Upper Bound:** By definition, `|f(x)| ≤ \\|f\\|_∞` almost everywhere.\n    `\\|f\\|_p = (∫|f|^p dμ)^{1/p} ≤ (∫\\|f\\|_∞^p dμ)^{1/p} = (\\|f\\|_∞^p μ(X))^{1/p} = \\|f\\|_∞ (μ(X))^{1/p}`.\n    As `p → ∞`, `μ(X)^{1/p} → 1`, so `limsup_{p→∞} \\|f\\|_p ≤ \\|f\\|_∞`.\n\n2.  **Lower Bound:** For any `δ > 0`, define the set `S_δ = {x : |f(x)| > \\|f\\|_∞ - δ}`.

We can combine these into a single complex sum `S` using Euler's formula, `e^{iθ} = \\cos(θ) + i\\sin(θ)`.\n\n1.  **Define the Complex Sum:**\n    Let `S = S_c + iS_s`.\n    $$ S = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\cos(a + kd) + i \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sin(a + kd) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(a + kd)} $$\n\n2.  **Factor and Identify the Geometric Series:**\n    We can factor out the term `e^{ia}` from the sum:\n    $$ S = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{ia} e^{ikd} = e^{ia} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (e^{id})^k $$\n    The sum is a finite geometric series with first term `1`, `n` terms, and common ratio `r = e^{id}`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Geometric Series Formula:**\n    The sum of a finite geometric series is given by `(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)`. Applying this formula, we get:\n    $$ S = e^{ia} \\left( \\frac{1 - (e^{id})^n}{1 - e^{id}} \\right) = e^{ia} \\left( \\frac{1 - e^{ind}}{1 - e^{id}} \\right) $$\n    This step is valid as long as the common ratio `r ≠ 1`, which means `e^{id} ≠ 1`. This is equivalent to `d` not being an integer multiple of `2π`, which is the condition `sin(d/2) ≠ 0`.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    To simplify the fraction, we use the identity `1 - e^{iθ} = e^{iθ/2}(e^{-iθ/2} - e^{iθ/2}) = -2i e^{iθ/2} \\sin(θ/2)`.\n    Applying this to the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   Numerator: `1 - e^{ind} = -2i e^{ind/2} \\sin(nd/2)`\n    *   Denominator: `1 - e^{id} = -2i e^{id/2} \\sin(d/2)`\n\n    Substituting these back into the expression for `S`:\n    $$ S = e^{ia} \\left( \\frac{-2i e^{ind/2} \\sin(nd/2)}{-2i e^{id/2} \\sin(d/2)} \\right) = e^{ia} \\left( \\frac{e^{ind/2}}{e^{id/2}} \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\right) $$\n    $$ S = e^{i(a + nd/2 - d/2)} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\right) = e^{i\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right)} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\right) $$\n\n5.  **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n    Now, we expand the complex exponential term back into its real and imaginary parts using Euler's formula:\n    $$ S = \\left[ \\cos\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\right) $$\n    Since `S = S_c + iS_s`, we can equate the real and imaginary parts of this equation.\n\n    *   The real part gives the formula for the sum of cosines:\n        $$ S_c = \\text{Re}(S) = \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\cos\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) $$\n\n    *   The imaginary part gives the formula for the sum of sines:\n        $$ S_s = \\text{Im}(S) = \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\sin\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) $$\n\nThis completes the proof for the case where `d` is not a multiple of `2π`. If `d` is a multiple of `2π`, then `cos(a+kd) = cos(a)` and `sin(a+kd) = sin(a)`, and the sums are trivially `n\\cos(a)` and `n\\sin(a)`.\n\nproof:\n### Problem Statement\n\nProve the following formulas for the sums of sines and cosines in an arithmetic progression, for any real numbers `a` and `d`, and integer `n ≥ 1`.\n\n1.  **Sum of Cosines:**\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\cos(a + kd) = \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\cos\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Sum of Sines:**\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sin(a + kd) = \\frac{\\sin(nd/2)}{\\sin(d/2)} \\sin\\left(a + \\frac{(n-1)d}{2}\\right) $$\n\n### Proof\n\nLet `S_c = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\cos(a + kd)` and `S_s = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sin(a + kd)`.

The inequality relation $>$ is defined on the set of real numbers. In standard mathematical notation, when we write $p > 1$ without specifying the number system, it is understood that $p$ belongs to the real numbers, as the ordering relation $>$ is only defined for real numbers (or subsets thereof like rational numbers, but these are contained in the reals). Therefore, from $p > 1$, we can deduce that $p$ must be a real number. More formally: The statement $p > 1$ implies that $p$ is comparable to 1 via the standard ordering, which is defined on the real number system. Hence, $p$ is a real number.\n"
