We will prove that the trace of A equals the sum of its eigenvalues.\\n\\n**Step 1: Characteristic Polynomial**\\nDefine the characteristic polynomial of A as:\\n\\\\[p(t) = \\\\det(A - tI)\\\\]\\nwhere I is the n×n identity matrix and t is an indeterminate.\\n\\n**Step 2: Factorization over Algebraically Closed Field**\\nSince F is algebraically closed, the characteristic polynomial factors completely into linear factors:\\n\\\\[p(t) = (-1)^n(t - \\\\lambda_1)(t - \\\\lambda_2)\\\\cdots(t - \\\\lambda_n)\\\\]\\nwhere λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ are the eigenvalues of A (counted with algebraic multiplicity). The factor (-1)^n appears because det(A - tI) = (-1)^n det(tI - A).\\n\\n**Step 3: Expansion of the Factored Form**\\nExpand the product of linear factors:\\n\\\\[(t - \\\\lambda_1)(t - \\\\lambda_2)\\\\cdots(t - \\\\lambda_n) = t^n - (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n(\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n)\\\\]\\nThis expansion follows from Vieta's formulas: the coefficient of t^{n-1} is -∑λ_i, and the constant term is (-1)^n∏λ_i.\\n\\nThus we have:\\n\\\\[p(t) = (-1)^n\\\\left[t^n - (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n(\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n)\\\\right]\\\\]\\n\\n**Step 4: Determinant Expansion**\\nNow expand det(A - tI) using the permutation formula for determinants:\\n\\\\[\\\\det(A - tI) = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma \\\\in S_n} \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\sigma) \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_{i\\\\sigma(i)} - t\\\\delta_{i\\\\sigma(i)})\\\\]\\nwhere S_n is the symmetric group on n elements, sgn(σ) is the sign of permutation σ, a_{ij} are entries of A, and δ_{ij} is the Kronecker delta.\\n\\n**Step 5: Coefficient of t^{n-1} from Determinant**\\nTo find the coefficient of t^{n-1} in this expansion, consider which terms contribute. A term contributes to t^{n-1} when we choose '-t' from exactly one factor in the product and choose the matrix entries from the remaining n-1 factors.\\n\\nSpecifically, for a fixed i ∈ {1,...,n}, consider permutations σ where:\\n1. σ(i) = i (so we get factor -t from position (i,i))\\n2. For all j ≠ i, σ(j) = j (so we get factors a_{jj} from diagonal positions)\\n\\nFor such permutations, the product becomes:\\n\\\\[(-t) \\\\times \\\\prod_{j\\\\neq i} a_{jj}\\\\]\\nand the sign is sgn(σ) = 1 since this is the identity permutation.\\n\\n**Step 6: Summing Contributions**\\nSumming over all i = 1,...,n, the total contribution to the coefficient of t^{n-1} is:\\n\\\\[-\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\prod_{j\\\\neq i} a_{jj} \\\\times t^{n-1}\\\\]\\n\\nHowever, we need to be more careful: In the full determinant expansion, the only permutations that contribute to the t^{n-1} term are those that fix exactly n-1 elements. The identity permutation (fixing all n elements) gives terms with t^n and t^{n-1}. Permutations that fix exactly n-1 elements must be transpositions, but those would involve off-diagonal entries.\\n\\nActually, a cleaner approach: Write A - tI = (a_{ij} - tδ_{ij}). The determinant is a polynomial in t. The coefficient of t^{n-1} comes from terms where we choose '-t' from exactly one diagonal position and choose a_{jj} from all other diagonal positions. More formally:\\n\\nConsider expanding det(A - tI) as a sum of products, each product containing exactly n factors, one from each row and column. To get a term with t^{n-1}, we must choose '-t' from exactly one diagonal entry (say position (i,i)) and choose the actual matrix entries from the remaining positions. The only way to choose n-1 other entries that multiply to give a term independent of t is to choose all other diagonal entries a_{jj} for j ≠ i. Any choice involving off-diagonal entries would require choosing additional '-t' terms to complete the product, giving lower powers of t.\\n\\nThus the coefficient of t^{n-1} is -∑_{i=1}^n a_{ii} = -tr(A).\\n\\n**Step 7: Characteristic Polynomial in Standard Form**\\nTherefore, we can write:\\n\\\\[p(t) = t^n - (\\\\operatorname{tr} A)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n \\\\det A\\\\]\\nwhere the coefficient of t^{n-1} is -tr(A), and the constant term is (-1)^n det(A).\\n\\n**Step 8: Comparing Coefficients**\\nFrom Step 3, we have:\\n\\\\[p(t) = (-1)^n\\\\left[t^n - (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n(\\\\lambda_1\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n)\\\\right]\\\\]\\n\\\\[= t^n - (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n(\\\\lambda_1\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n)\\\\]\\n\\nFrom Step 7, we have:\\n\\\\[p(t) = t^n - (\\\\operatorname{tr} A)t^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + (-1)^n \\\\det A\\\\]\\n\\nSince these are two expressions for the same polynomial p(t), their coefficients must be equal. Comparing the coefficients of t^{n-1}:\\n\\\\[-(\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n) = -\\\\operatorname{tr} A\\\\]\\n\\n**Step 9: Conclusion**\\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\\n\\\\[\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_n = \\\\operatorname{tr} A\\\\]\\n\\nThus we have proved that the trace of a square matrix over an algebraically closed field equals the sum of its eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity).\\n\\n**Additional Note:** Comparing constant terms also gives the well-known result:\\n\\\\[\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_n = \\\\det A\\\\]\\nwhich shows that the determinant equals the product of eigenvalues.\"\n}\n```",
