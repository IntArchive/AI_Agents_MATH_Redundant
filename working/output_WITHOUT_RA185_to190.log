proof_sketch:  Step 1) Define the graph G = {(x, y(x)) : x ∈ [0,1)} as a subset of ℝ².
Step 2) Recall that ℝ² has the standard Euclidean topology.
Step 3) By definition, the subspace topology on G inherited from ℝ² is: A subset U ⊆ G is open in G if and only if there exists an open set V ⊆ ℝ² such that U = V ∩ G.
Step 4) Since G is defined as a subset of ℝ², it automatically comes equipped with this subspace topology when considered as a topological subspace of ℝ².
Step 5) Therefore, the graph G is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ² by the very definition of how we treat subsets of topological spaces.

detailed_proof:  We prove that the graph G of the function y inherits the subspace topology from ℝ² as follows:

1. **Definition of the graph**: Let G = {(x, y(x)) ∈ ℝ² : x ∈ [0,1)} be the graph of the function y. This is a well-defined subset of ℝ² since for each x ∈ [0,1), y(x) is a real number, so the ordered pair (x, y(x)) is an element of ℝ².

2. **Topology on ℝ²**: The set ℝ² is equipped with the standard Euclidean topology, which is generated by the basis of open balls B((a,b), ε) = {(x,y) ∈ ℝ² : √[(x-a)² + (y-b)²] < ε} for all (a,b) ∈ ℝ² and ε > 0.

3. **Definition of subspace topology**: For any subset A of a topological space X, the subspace topology on A is defined as follows: A subset U ⊆ A is open in A if and only if there exists an open set V ⊆ X such that U = V ∩ A. Equivalently, the subspace topology on A is the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map i: A → X, i(a) = a, is continuous.

4. **G as a subset of ℝ²**: By construction, G ⊆ ℝ². Specifically, G consists of all points of the form (x, sin(1/x)) for x ∈ (0,1) together with the point (0,0).

5. **Inheritance of subspace topology**: Since G is a subset of the topological space ℝ² (with Euclidean topology), by the definition of how subsets inherit topology from their containing space, G automatically comes equipped with the subspace topology. Formally:
   - The topological space (G, τ_G) where τ_G = {U ⊆ G : ∃ V open in ℝ² such that U = V ∩ G}
   - This τ_G is precisely the subspace topology on G inherited from ℝ².

6. **Verification**: To verify this is indeed the correct topology on G, note that:
   a) The inclusion map i: G → ℝ², i((x,y(x))) = (x,y(x)), is continuous with respect to τ_G.
   b) τ_G is the smallest topology on G making the inclusion map continuous.
   c) For any open set V ⊆ ℝ², its intersection with G, V ∩ G, is open in G by definition of τ_G.

7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the graph G of the function y is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from ℝ². This follows directly from the definition of subspace topology and the fact that G is defined as a subset of ℝ². The specific form of the function y (y(x) = sin(1/x) for x > 0 and y(0) = 0) does not affect this topological inheritance property; it only determines the particular shape of the subset G.

Remark: This result is essentially tautological in topology - when we speak of 'the graph of a function' as a geometric object in ℝ², the natural topology to consider is precisely the subspace topology inherited from ℝ². Any other topology would require explicit specification and justification.

detailed_proof:  We aim to prove that $\lim_{x \to 1} (x + 4) = 5$ using the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit.

**Step 1: State the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition**
According to the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit, we need to show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - 1| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - 5| < \epsilon$, where $f(x) = x + 4$.

**Step 2: Simplify the expression $|f(x) - 5|$**
We compute:
\[
|f(x) - 5| = |(x + 4) - 5| = |x - 1|
\]
This simplification is valid for all real numbers $x$.

**Step 3: Determine the relationship between $\delta$ and $\epsilon$**
From Step 2, we need to find $\delta > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - 1| < \delta$, then $|x - 1| < \epsilon$.

Observing that $|x - 1|$ appears on both sides of the implication, we can choose $\delta$ to be directly related to $\epsilon$. Specifically, if we choose $\delta = \epsilon$, then:
- If $0 < |x - 1| < \delta = \epsilon$, then automatically $|x - 1| < \epsilon$.

**Step 4: Verify the choice of $\delta$**
Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Choose $\delta = \epsilon$ (which is positive since $\epsilon > 0$).

Now suppose $0 < |x - 1| < \delta = \epsilon$. Then:
\[
|f(x) - 5| = |(x + 4) - 5| = |x - 1| < \epsilon
\]
Thus, the condition $|f(x) - 5| < \epsilon$ is satisfied.

**Step 5: Alternative choices for $\delta$**
Note that we could also choose any $\delta$ such that $0 < \delta \leq \epsilon$. For example, $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{2}$ or $\delta = \min(\epsilon, 1)$ would also work. The key requirement is that $\delta \leq \epsilon$ to ensure that $|x - 1| < \delta$ implies $|x - 1| < \epsilon$.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
We have shown that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ (specifically, $\delta = \epsilon$) such that if $0 < |x - 1| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - 5| < \epsilon$. By the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit, this proves that:
\[
\lim_{x \to 1} (x + 4) = 5
\]

**Additional remarks:**
1. The proof is complete and rigorous.
2. The function $f(x) = x + 4$ is linear, which makes the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ proof particularly straightforward.
3. The choice $\delta = \epsilon$ is optimal in the sense that it's the largest possible $\delta$ that works for all $\epsilon > 0$.
4. This proof demonstrates that the limit exists and equals 5, confirming the claim in the problem statement.

Step 1) Define a free ℤ-module F as a module with a basis B (a linearly independent generating set over ℤ).

detailed_proof:  Let F be a free ℤ-module. By definition, F has a basis B, which is a subset of F such that:
1. B generates F (every element of F can be written as a finite ℤ-linear combination of elements of B)
2. B is linearly independent over ℤ (if ∑_{b∈B} n_b b = 0 with n_b ∈ ℤ and only finitely many n_b nonzero, then all n_b = 0)

Since ℤ is a PID (Principal Ideal Domain), we can use the following standard theorem from module theory: Over a PID, every submodule of a free module is free. However, for our immediate purpose, we don't need this theorem directly; we only need to construct the isomorphism.

Step 1: Construction of the isomorphism
Define a homomorphism φ: ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ → F as follows:
For each b ∈ B, let e_b be the standard basis element of the direct sum ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ, which has 1 in the b-coordinate and 0 elsewhere. Define φ(e_b) = b.
Extend φ ℤ-linearly: For any element ∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b ∈ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ (with only finitely many n_b nonzero), define φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b) = ∑_{b∈B} n_b b.

Step 2: φ is well-defined
Since any element of ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ has only finitely many nonzero coordinates, the sum ∑_{b∈B} n_b b is a finite sum in F, hence well-defined.

Step 3: φ is a ℤ-module homomorphism
For any x = ∑ n_b e_b and y = ∑ m_b e_b in ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ and any r ∈ ℤ:
φ(x + y) = φ(∑ (n_b + m_b) e_b) = ∑ (n_b + m_b) b = ∑ n_b b + ∑ m_b b = φ(x) + φ(y)
φ(rx) = φ(∑ (rn_b) e_b) = ∑ (rn_b) b = r∑ n_b b = rφ(x)

Step 4: φ is surjective
Since B generates F, every element f ∈ F can be written as f = ∑_{b∈B} n_b b for some n_b ∈ ℤ (with only finitely many nonzero). Then f = φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b), so φ is surjective.

Step 5: φ is injective
Suppose φ(∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b) = 0. Then ∑_{b∈B} n_b b = 0 in F. By linear independence of B, all coefficients n_b must be 0. Hence ∑_{b∈B} n_b e_b = 0, so φ is injective.

Step 6: φ is an isomorphism
Since φ is a bijective ℤ-module homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, F ≅ ⊕_{b∈B} ℤ.

Step 7: Uniqueness of rank
Suppose F is isomorphic to two direct sums: F ≅ ⊕_{I} ℤ ≅ ⊕_{J} ℤ, where I and J are index sets. We need to show |I| = |J|.

Consider the quotient module F/2F, where 2F = {2f : f ∈ F}. Since 2ℤ is an ideal of ℤ, 2F is a submodule of F.

Using the isomorphisms:
F/2F ≅ (⊕_{I} ℤ)/(⊕_{I} 2ℤ) ≅ ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ)
Similarly, F/2F ≅ ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ)

Now, ℤ/2ℤ is a field (of characteristic 2), so ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ) and ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ) are vector spaces over ℤ/2ℤ.

The dimension of ⊕_{I} (ℤ/2ℤ) as a ℤ/2ℤ-vector space is |I| (the cardinality of I), since the images of the standard basis elements form a basis.
Similarly, the dimension of ⊕_{J} (ℤ/2ℤ) is |J|.

Since these vector spaces are isomorphic (both isomorphic to F/2F), they have the same dimension. Therefore, |I| = |J|.

Step 8: Conclusion
We have shown that any free ℤ-module F is isomorphic to a direct sum ⊕_{B} ℤ, where B is any basis of F, and the cardinality |B| (called the rank of F) is uniquely determined by F (independent of the choice of basis).

Note: The assumption about ∏_{ℕ} ℤ (the infinite direct product of copies of ℤ) serves as an important example: while free ℤ-modules are direct sums of copies of ℤ, the module ∏_{ℕ} ℤ is NOT free over ℤ. This is known as the Baer-Specker group theorem. The existence of such non-free modules over ℤ (a PID) shows that not every ℤ-module is free, making the characterization of free modules particularly significant.

detailed_proof:  We begin by analyzing the statement 'Prove that n approaches infinity' in the context of the given assumptions.

**Step 1: Clarifying the nature of n**
From Assumption 1, n is specified as a positive integer. In mathematical notation, this means n ∈ ℤ⁺. The statement 'n approaches infinity' suggests a limiting process, but n is presented as a parameter, not as a variable in a limit expression. In standard mathematical practice, we do not say 'n approaches infinity' about a parameter; rather, we use limit notation to describe the behavior of functions or sequences as their arguments or indices increase without bound.

**Step 2: Understanding limit notation**
In mathematical analysis, the notation lim_{n→∞} f(n) = L has a precise meaning: for every ε > 0, there exists N ∈ ℕ such that for all n > N, |f(n) - L| < ε. This describes the behavior of the function f(n) as n increases without bound. The statement 'n approaches infinity' by itself lacks the essential components of a limit statement: there is no function f(n) whose limit is being taken, and there is no limit value L being approached.

**Step 3: The problem with the original statement**
The statement 'Prove that n approaches infinity' is problematic for several reasons:
1. n is given as a positive integer parameter, not as a variable in a limiting process.
2. Without a function f(n), we cannot apply the ε-N definition of a limit.
3. The phrase 'approaches infinity' typically describes the behavior of a sequence or function, not a parameter itself.
4. In rigorous mathematics, we prove statements about limits of functions or sequences, not about parameters 'approaching' values.

**Step 4: What would be needed for a valid proof**
For a valid limit proof, we would need:
- A complete limit expression: lim_{n→∞} f(n) = L, where f is a well-defined function
- Or a statement about a sequence: The sequence {a_n} converges to L as n → ∞
- Or a statement about divergence: lim_{n→∞} f(n) = ∞ (meaning f(n) grows without bound)

**Step 5: Formal demonstration of the issue**
Let's attempt to formalize what would be required to prove 'n approaches infinity':

Suppose we interpret this as proving lim_{n→∞} n = ∞. Even this interpretation requires careful handling:
1. We would need to prove: For every M > 0, there exists N ∈ ℕ such that for all n > N, n > M.
2. However, this is trivially true by taking N = ⌊M⌋, since if n > ⌊M⌋ and n is a positive integer, then n ≥ ⌊M⌋ + 1 > M.
3. But this proof would be about the sequence defined by a_n = n, not about the parameter n itself.

**Conclusion:**
The statement 'Prove that n approaches infinity' is not a well-formed mathematical statement that can be proven. It lacks the necessary components of a limit statement. The proper formulation would require specifying what function of n is being considered and what limit value (finite or infinite) it approaches. Without such specification, no meaningful proof can be constructed.

Therefore, the original problem statement is mathematically ill-posed and cannot be proven as stated. A corrected problem would need to specify a complete limit expression such as lim_{n→∞} f(n) = L or prove that a specific sequence diverges to infinity.
