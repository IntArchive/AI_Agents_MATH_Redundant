    "Content":"This is just a curiosity. I have come across multiple proofs of the fact that there are infinitely many primes, some of them were quite trivial, but some others were really, really fancy. I'll show you what proofs I have and I'd like to know more because I think it's cool to see that something can be proved in so many different ways. Proof 1 : Euclid's. If there are finitely many primes then $p_1 p_2 ... p_n + 1$ is coprime to all of these guys. This is the basic idea in most proofs : generate a number coprime to all previous primes. Proof 2 : Consider the sequence $a_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$. We have that \n$$\n2^{2^n}-1 = (2^{2^1} - 1) \\prod_{m=1}^{n-1} (2^{2^m}+1),\n$$ \nso that for $m < n$, $(2^{2^m} + 1, 2^{2^n} + 1) \\, | \\, (2^{2^n}-1, 2^{2^n} +1) = 1$. Since we have an infinite sequence of numbers coprime in pairs, at least one prime number must divide each one of them and they are all distinct primes, thus giving an infinity of them. Proof 3 : (Note : I particularly like this one.) Define a topology on $\\mathbb Z$ in the following way : a set $\\mathscr N$ of integers is said to be open if for every $n \\in \\mathscr N$ there is an arithmetic progression $\\mathscr A$ such that $n \\in \\mathscr A \\subseteq \\mathscr N$. This can easily be proven to define a topology on $\\mathbb Z$. Note that under this topology arithmetic progressions are open and closed. Supposing there are finitely many primes, notice that this means that the set\n$$\n\\mathscr U \\,\\,\\,\\, \\overset{def}{=} \\,\\,\\, \\bigcup_{p} \\,\\, p \\mathbb Z\n$$\nshould be open and closed, but by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, its complement in $\\mathbb Z$ is the set $\\{ -1, 1 \\}$, which is not open, thus giving a contradiction. Proof 4 : Let $a,b$ be coprime integers and $c > 0$. There exists $x$ such that $(a+bx, c) = 1$. To see this, choose $x$ such that $a+bx \\not\\equiv 0 \\, \\mathrm{mod}$ $p_i$ for all primes $p_i$ dividing $c$. If $a \\equiv 0 \\, \\mathrm{mod}$ $p_i$, since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, $b$ has an inverse mod $p_i$, call it $\\overline{b}$. Choosing $x \\equiv \\overline{b} \\, \\mathrm{mod}$ $p_i$, you are done. If $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\, \\mathrm{mod}$ $p_i$, then choosing $x \\equiv 0 \\, \\mathrm{mod}$ $p_i$ works fine. Find $x$ using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Now assuming there are finitely many primes, let $c$ be the product of all of them. Our construction generates an integer coprime to $c$, giving a contradiction to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Proof 5 : Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions (just so that you not bring it up as an example...) Do you have any other nice proofs?",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"When I taught undergraduate number theory I subjected my students to a barrage of proofs of the infinitude of the prime numbers: see these lecture notes .  I gave eight proofs altogether.  Of course by now the list which has been currently compiled has a large overlap with mine, but one proof which has not yet been mentioned is Washington's algebraic number theory proof: Proposition: Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain with fraction field $K$ .  If $R$ has only finitely many prime ideals, then for every finite degree field extension $L\/K$ , the integral closure $S$ of $R$ in $L$ is a PID. (The proof boils down to two facts: (i) a Dedekind domain with finitely many prime ideals is a PID.  (ii) with notation as above, the map $\\operatorname{Spec S} \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Spec R}$ is surjective and at most $[L:K]$ -to-one, so $R$ has infinitely many prime ideals iff $S$ has infinitely many prime ideals.) Corollary: There are infinitely many primes. Proof: Applying the Proposition with $R = \\mathbb{Z}$ , if there were only finitely many primes, then for every number field $K$ , the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_K$ of integers in $K$ would be a PID, hence a UFD.  But for instance this fails for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$ , as $2 \\cdot 3 = (1+\\sqrt{-5})(1-\\sqrt{-5})$ is a nonunique factorization into ireducible elements (since there are no elements of norm $2$ or $3$ ) in $\\mathbb{Z}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ .",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and format a problem from Math Stack Exchange into the specified structure. The example given shows that assumptions should be listed line by line, each addressing one property or condition applied to one object, followed by the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the example, the original problem mentioned divisibility by 91, and the formatted version included two assumptions: that n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote \"for every integer n\", so maybe the example added an extra assumption? Hmm, maybe the example was a different problem. Anyway, the key is to extract all the assumptions from the problem.\n\nNow, the current problem is about different proofs that there are infinitely many primes. The user provided several proofs and is asking for more. The task is to structure this into the Assumption and Problem sections. However, the problem here isn't a typical math problem to solve but rather a request for various proofs. But the format requires \"Assumption\" and \"Problem\" sections. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original question is titled \"Different ways to prove there are infinitely many primes?\" and the user lists several proofs and asks for more. So how to structure this? The example given had specific assumptions leading to a problem to prove something. Here, the problem is to present different proofs. But the assumptions might be the basic premises used in the problem. However, since the question is about providing proofs, the assumptions might be the initial conditions or hypotheses each proof uses.\n\nWait, but the problem as stated is more of a discussion rather than a specific problem with assumptions. However, the user wants to filter unrelated information and structure it. Let me read the original question again carefully.\n\nThe question starts by stating it's a curiosity about multiple proofs of infinitely many primes. The user lists Proofs 1 to 5 and asks for more. The core problem is \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes\" but presented in a way that asks for various methods. So perhaps the assumptions are the basic premises each proof uses, but since the user is asking for different proofs, maybe the main assumption is that we are working within the realm of integers and standard number theory, but the problem is to provide different proofs of the infinitude of primes.\n\nBut in the example, the assumptions were specific to the problem. For the original example, the problem was to prove divisibility by 91, and the assumptions included that n is an integer and divisible by 7. So maybe the assumptions here are the general mathematical axioms or the basic properties of primes. But the problem itself is to prove infinitude of primes, and the user is looking for various proofs. However, the user isn't stating any specific conditions; it's a general question.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumptions are implicit in each proof. For instance, Euclid's proof assumes the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (unique factorization), the topological proof assumes certain properties of topologies on Z, etc. But the user hasn't specified any particular assumptions; they just want different proofs. So maybe the main problem is \"Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers\" and the assumptions are that we are working in the standard integer number system with the usual definitions of primes. But in the example, the assumption was specific to the problem (n is an integer, n divisible by 7). Since this is a more general problem, maybe there are no specific assumptions beyond the standard mathematical framework. However, the user might need to list any assumptions each proof makes, but since the problem is the general infinitude, perhaps the only assumption is that primes are defined as usual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to present different proofs, each under their own assumptions. But the user hasn't specified. Given the example, perhaps the problem is to list different proofs, but structured as the problem statement. But the example's format is for a single problem with assumptions. The user here is asking to structure the problem as per the format. Since the original question is \"Different ways to prove there are infinitely many primes?\", the formatted problem should capture that.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nAssumption: Primes are integers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves.\nProblem: Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using various methods.\n\nBut the user's example had multiple assumptions listed. In the original problem, the user mentions Euclid's proof, using coprimality, then another proof using a sequence, another using topology, etc. Each proof may have different assumptions. However, the problem is not to list assumptions for each proof but to state the overall problem with its assumptions.\n\nWait, but the original question isn't a problem to solve but a request for different proofs. However, the user wants to structure the problem as per the given format, which is for a problem with assumptions and the problem statement. So maybe the main assumption is the definition of primes and the standard number theory framework. The problem is to provide different proofs of their infinitude.\n\nBut the example given had specific assumptions related to the problem (n is integer, n divisible by 7). In contrast, the problem here is more general. Perhaps the assumptions here are the basic properties of primes. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, the original problem was to prove that A(n) is divisible by 91 for every integer n. The formatted problem listed two assumptions: n is an integer and n is divisible by 7. Wait, but the original problem says \"for every integer n\", so the assumption that n is divisible by 7 is incorrect. That suggests that maybe the example was flawed or maybe there was a mistake. But perhaps the user intended to present an example where the problem had an additional condition. Hmm, perhaps the example was from a different problem where n was required to be divisible by 7. But regardless, the key is that each assumption is a single condition on one object.\n\nBack to the current problem. The problem is to prove there are infinitely many primes. The assumptions needed for this problem would be the basic properties of primes and integers. However, since the problem is a fundamental one in number theory, the assumptions might be considered part of the standard mathematical framework. But to list them explicitly:\n\nAssumptions:\n- An integer greater than 1 is prime if it has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- The set of integers is infinite.\n- The fundamental theorem of arithmetic holds (unique prime factorization).\n\nBut the problem as posed in the original question doesn't state these; they are implicit. The user is asking for different proofs, each of which may have their own set of assumptions or use different areas of mathematics (like topology in Proof 3).\n\nHowever, the formatting example provided by the user seems to take the problem as given and extract explicit assumptions from the problem statement. In the example, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", which is an assumption, but the formatted problem added \"n is divisible by 7\", which wasn't in the original. Wait, that seems incorrect. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example problem:\n\"Prove that for every integer $n$, the number  \n$$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$  \nis divisible by 91.\"\n\nFormatted problem:\nAssumption: $n$ is an integer, $n$ is divisible by $7$.\n\nProblem: Prove that $$A(n) = 5^n \\left( 5^n + 1 \\right) - 6^n \\left( 3^n + 2^n \\right)$$ is divisible by 91.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"for every integer n\", but the formatted problem adds that n is divisible by 7. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the example was from a different problem where n had to be divisible by 7? Because otherwise, the original problem's assumption is that n is any integer, but the formatted problem added a restriction. This suggests that perhaps the example is incorrect, but the user wants me to follow their format regardless.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the current problem. The original problem is asking for different ways to prove there are infinitely many primes. The user lists several proofs and asks for more. The task is to format this into Assumption and Problem sections.\n\nBut the original problem doesn't have explicit assumptions beyond the standard mathematical definitions. However, in the example, even if the original problem didn't state the assumption, the formatted version added it. So perhaps in this case, the assumptions are that primes are defined as usual, but since the problem is to prove infinitude, the assumptions might include the properties of integers, primes, etc. But since the problem is very general, maybe the only assumption is the definition of primes.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's example added an assumption not present in the original problem, maybe in this case, we need to list the implicit assumptions. Let's see:\n\nAssumptions:\n- A prime number is an integer greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- The set of integers is infinite.\n- Arithmetic operations and divisibility are defined as usual in number theory.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The example might have been a specific case where the user added an assumption (n divisible by 7) that wasn't in the original problem, which might be incorrect, but following that example, perhaps here the assumptions are the basic definitions.\n\nBut the original problem in the example was about divisibility by 91, which factors into 7*13. So perhaps the assumption that n is divisible by 7 was necessary for the proof, but the original problem stated \"for every integer n\", which would be a contradiction. So maybe the example had a typo or mistake, but the user still wants to follow that format.\n\nGiven that, perhaps for the current problem, the assumptions would be:\n\nAssumption: \nPrimes are integers greater than 1.\nThe set of integers is considered.\n\nProblem: \nProve that there are infinitely many primes using various methods.\n\nBut the user's example listed each assumption on a separate line. So maybe:\n\nAssumption: \nA prime number is defined as an integer greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and itself.\nThe set of integers is infinite.\nArithmetic operations follow standard properties.\n\nProblem: \nProve that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBut the original question is asking for different ways to prove it, so the problem is more about showcasing various methods rather than a single proof. However, the format requires the problem statement. Maybe the problem is \"Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using different methods.\"\n\nBut the example's problem was \"Prove that A(n) is divisible by 91.\" So following that, here the problem would be \"Prove that there are infinitely many primes,\" and the assumptions are the basic definitions and conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assumptions are left empty, but that doesn't fit the example. Given the confusion with the example, maybe the user wants the problem as stated, with assumptions extracted from the problem's conditions.\n\nLooking back at the original question: \"Different ways to prove there are infinitely many primes?\" The user is not stating a theorem with conditions but asking for proofs. However, the task is to structure it into assumptions and problem. Given the example, even if the original problem didn't have explicit assumptions, they were listed. So perhaps here the assumptions are the standard mathematical definitions required for the proofs.\n\nTherefore, the formatted problem would be:\n\nAssumption: \nA prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nThe set of integers is considered with standard arithmetic operations.\n\nProblem: \nProve using various methods that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBut the original question is phrased as a request for different proofs, so the problem is to provide different proofs. But in the example, the problem was to prove a statement. So perhaps the problem is \"Provide different proofs that there are infinitely many primes.\"\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct formatting would be:\n\nAssumption:\nA prime number is an integer greater than 1 with exactly two distinct positive divisors.\nThe set of integers is infinite.\nStandard arithmetic properties hold.\n\nProblem:\nProve that there are infinitely many prime numbers using various methods.\n\nBut perhaps the assumptions are redundant here since they are part of the standard mathematical context. However, following the example, even if the original problem didn't state \"n is an integer,\" it was listed as an assumption. Therefore, for completeness, the assumptions here would include the definition of primes and the integer system.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n###BEGIN_OF_FORMAT###\nAssumption: \nA prime number is an integer greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nThe set of integers is infinite.\nStandard arithmetic operations and divisibility apply.\n\nProblem: \nProve that there are infinitely many prime numbers using various methods.\n###",
