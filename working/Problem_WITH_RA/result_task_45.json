    "Content":"I discovered this elegant theorem in my facebook feed. Does anyone have any idea how to prove? Formulations of this theorem can be found in the answers and the comments. You are welcome to join in the discussion. Edit:\nCurrent progress: The theorem is proven. There is a bound to curvature to be satisfied before the theorem can hold. Some unresolved issues and some food for thought: (1) Formalise the definition (construction) of the parallel curve in the case of concave curves. Thereafter, consider whether this theorem is true under this definition, where the closed smooth curve is formed by convex and concave curves linked alternatively. (2) Reaffirm the upper bond of $r$ proposed, i.e. $r=\\rho$ , where $\\rho$ is the radius of the curvature, to avoid self-intersection. (3) What is the least identity of the curves in order for this theorem to be true?\nThis is similar to the first part of question (1). (4) Can this proof be more generalised? For example, what if this theorem is extended into higher dimensions? (Is there any analogy in higher dimensions?) Also, I would like to bring your attention towards some of the newly posted answers. Meanwhile, any alternative approach or proof is encouraged. Please do not hesitate in providing any insights or comments in further progressing this question.",
    "AcceptedAnswer":"Let $\\beta: I \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R^2}, I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ be a positively oriented plane curve parametrised by arc length . Now note that $\\alpha$ is constructed by moving each point on $\\beta$ a distance of $r$ along its unit normal vector. We can articulate this more precisely: Since $\\beta$ is param. by arc length, by definition, its ( unit ) tangent vector $\\beta' =t_\\beta$ has a norm of $1$ - that is, $t_\\beta . t_\\beta = 1$. Differentiate this inner product using the product rule to see that $2t_\\beta . t'_\\beta = 0$. One deduces that $t'_\\beta \\perp t$ and since $\\beta$ is positively oriented, it is apparent that $\\beta''=t'_\\beta$ is exactly the outward normal vector of $\\beta$ - we must normalise this to obtain the unit normal. Do so using the Serret-Frenet relation in the plane (i.e. 'torsion', $\\tau$ vanishes) $\\beta''=\\kappa n_\\beta$ (where $\\kappa$ is the signed plane curvature at any given point), and so $n_\\beta=\\frac{\\beta''}{\\kappa}$. So, $$\n\\alpha = \\beta + r\\frac{\\beta''}{\\kappa} = \\beta + n_\\beta \\ \\ \\ (*)\n$$ The arc length of some space curve $\\gamma:(a,b)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R^n}$ parametrised by arc length is given by, $$\n\\int^b_a ||\\gamma'(s)||\\,ds\n$$ (where $s$ is the parametrisation variable) Let $l_\\alpha$ and $l_\\beta$ denote the respective lengths of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We wish to show that $l_\\alpha - l_\\beta=2\\pi r$ Computing the relevant integral using ($*$) (I needn't bother explicitly writing the bounds since these aren't important to us here) and writing $\\beta:= \\beta(s)$ (which in turn, induces $\\alpha=\\alpha(s))$, $$\nl_\\alpha - l_\\beta= \\int ||\\alpha'||\\,ds - \\int ||\\beta'||\\,ds = \\int \\left(||\\beta' + r n'_\\beta|| - ||\\beta'||\\right)\\,ds\\ \\ \\ \\ (**)\n$$ Recall that $\\beta'=t_\\beta$.We must determine the nature of $n'_\\beta$ in order to proceed: Define the scalar function $\\theta(s)$ as the inclination of $t_\\beta(s)$ to the horizontal. Then we may write $t_\\beta(s)=(\\cos\\theta(s),\\sin\\theta(s))$, and so $n_\\beta=(-\\sin\\theta(s),\\cos\\theta(s))$ by application of the rotation matrix through $\\pi\/2$. This gives us, $$\nn'_\\beta(s)=-\\theta'(s)t_\\beta(s)\n$$ We can stop sweating now since we can see that $n'_\\beta$ is parallel to $\\beta'$ -  and that makes everything pretty neat. Plugging all of this into ($**$) and recalling that $||t_\\beta||=1$, $$\nl_\\alpha - l_\\beta= \\int \\left(||t_\\beta -r\\theta't_\\beta|| - ||t_\\beta||\\right)\\,ds = \\int \\left(||t_\\beta||.||1-r\\theta'-1||\\right)\\,ds = \\int \\left(||-r\\theta'||\\right)\\,ds$$ And finally, $$\nl_\\alpha-l_\\beta = \\int \\left(||-r\\theta'||\\right)\\,ds= r \\int \\left(||\\theta'||\\right)\\,ds=2\\pi r\n$$ Q.E.D Fun fact : $\\theta'(s)$ is exactly $\\kappa(s)$, the signed plane curvature (from Serret-Frenet relation $t'=\\kappa n$ for space curves given torsion $\\tau$ vanishes) and so the final integral is often seen as $\\int \\kappa(s)ds$ which is a quantity called the total curvature ! Caveat One must assume differentiability on the inner curve - note that the result fails for polygons or when given vertices. Furthermore, the special case of concave curves (where the initial result $l_\\alpha=l_\\beta+2\\pi r$ does not always hold) is discussed in the comments below - this is not too difficult to deal with given a restriction on $r$ (though we don't have to apply this restriction if self-intersections are permitted ; if they are indeed permitted, the proof will still work!) and modified computation of the total curvature.",

    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a bilingual math professor and structure the given Math Stack Exchange question into the specified format. The example provided shows that I need to list all assumptions line by line, each addressing only one property or condition applied to one object, then state the problem clearly.\n\nLooking at the original problem from the user: the title is \"Prove the theorem on analytic geometry in the picture.\" The question mentions an elegant theorem discovered on a Facebook feed, asking for a proof. There's a lot of additional information about current progress, unresolved issues, and extensions, but I need to filter out the unrelated parts.\n\nFirst, the main problem is to prove the theorem mentioned, which seems to involve parallel curves, curvature, and possibly closed smooth curves. The current progress mentions that the theorem is proven with a curvature bound to avoid self-intersection. The assumptions would need to be extracted from the problem's context. \n\nThe user mentions \"closed smooth curve,\" \"parallel curve,\" and conditions like \"radius of curvature r=ρ to avoid self-intersection.\" The unresolved issues talk about concave curves, upper bound of r, and generalization. But for the structured problem, I need to focus only on the necessary assumptions from the theorem's statement, not the unresolved parts.\n\nAssuming the theorem states something like: For a closed smooth curve with certain curvature conditions, the parallel curve at distance r (where r is less than the radius of curvature) has a specific property. The exact property isn't stated here, but since the original problem is about proving the theorem as mentioned in the picture, which we don't have. However, based on the context, common theorems in analytic geometry about parallel curves might involve properties like the length, area, or homothety.\n\nBut since the user wants assumptions, each on one line, applied to one object. The problem mentions \"closed smooth curve,\" \"radius of curvature ρ,\" and r=ρ to avoid self-intersection. So possible assumptions could be:\n\n- The curve is closed.\n- The curve is smooth.\n- The radius of curvature ρ of the curve satisfies some condition (like r ≤ ρ).\n- The parallel curve is constructed at a distance r where r is bounded by ρ to prevent self-intersection.\n\nHowever, without the exact theorem statement, it's challenging, but based on the user's description, I can infer the necessary assumptions. The problem is to prove the theorem related to the parallel curve under these conditions.\n\nSo, structuring the assumptions as per the example:\n\nAssumption: The curve is closed.\nAssumption: The curve is smooth.\nAssumption: The radius of curvature ρ of the curve is such that r ≤ ρ.\nAssumption: The parallel curve is constructed without self-intersection.\n\nProblem: Prove the theorem on analytic geometry related to the parallel curve of a closed smooth curve with radius of curvature ρ and distance r satisfying r ≤ ρ.\n\nBut since the exact theorem's conclusion isn't given, maybe it's about the length or area? Alternatively, maybe the theorem is that the parallel curve at distance r has a certain property if r is less than the radius of curvature. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the problem is as stated, and the assumptions are as extracted from the current progress.\n\nWait, the original problem's title is \"Prove the theorem on analytic geometry in the picture.\" The user can't include the picture, so the problem is as described in the text. The current progress mentions that there's a bound on curvature (r=ρ to avoid self-intersection). The problem is to prove the theorem under these conditions.\n\nSo the formatted problem would have assumptions about the curve being closed, smooth, and the radius r being bounded by the curvature radius. The problem statement is to prove the theorem (which, without more details, is as given in the picture, but we can state it as per the user's description).",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nproof:\nLet C be a smooth, closed plane curve. Let C_r be the parallel curve to C at a distance r. Assume that r is less than the minimum radius of curvature of C. Prove that the curvature of C_r, denoted by κ_r, at a point corresponding to a point on C with curvature κ, is given by κ_r = κ \/ (1 - rκ).\n\nLet the curve C be parameterized by its arc length `s`, so `C(s)`. The unit tangent vector is `t(s) = C'(s)` and the principal unit normal vector is `n(s)`. The curvature is `κ(s)`. The Frenet-Serret formulas state `t'(s) = κ(s)n(s)` and `n'(s) = -κ(s)t(s)`.\n\nThe parallel curve `C_r` at a distance `r` is parameterized by `C_r(s) = C(s) + r·n(s)`.\n\nTo find the curvature of `C_r`, we differentiate `C_r(s)` with respect to `s`:\n`C_r'(s) = C'(s) + r·n'(s) = t(s) - rκ(s)t(s) = (1 - rκ(s))t(s)`.\n\nThe arc length `s_r` of the parallel curve is given by the integral of the magnitude of its velocity vector. The speed is:\n`ds_r\/ds = |C_r'(s)| = |(1 - rκ(s))t(s)| = |1 - rκ(s)| · |t(s)|`.\nSince `r` is less than the minimum radius of curvature, `r < ρ_min`, which implies `r < 1\/κ_max`, so `rκ(s) < 1` for all `s`. Thus, `1 - rκ(s)` is always positive. As `|t(s)| = 1`, we have:\n`ds_r\/ds = 1 - rκ(s)`.\n\nThe unit tangent vector `t_r` to the parallel curve is:\n`t_r = C_r'(s) \/ |C_r'(s)| = ((1 - rκ(s))t(s)) \/ (1 - rκ(s)) = t(s)`.\nThe tangent vectors of C and C_r are parallel at corresponding points. Consequently, their normal vectors are also the same: `n_r = n(s)`.\n\nThe curvature `κ_r` of the parallel curve is given by the Frenet-Serret formula `dt_r\/ds_r = κ_r · n_r`. Using the chain rule:\n`dt_r\/ds_r = (dt_r\/ds) · (ds\/ds_r)`.\nSince `t_r = t(s)`, we have `dt_r\/ds = dt(s)\/ds = κ(s)n(s)`.\nAnd `ds\/ds_r = 1 \/ (1 - rκ(s))`.\nSubstituting these gives:\n`dt_r\/ds_r = κ(s)n(s) · (1 \/ (1 - rκ(s))) = (κ(s) \/ (1 - rκ(s))) · n(s)`.\n\nSince `n_r = n(s)`, we have:\n`κ_r · n_r = (κ(s) \/ (1 - rκ(s))) · n_r`.\nTherefore, the curvature of the parallel curve is:\n`κ_r = κ(s) \/ (1 - rκ(s))`.\n\nfinal:\nProblem:\nProve the theorem on analytic geometry stating the property of the parallel curve for a closed smooth curve, where: the curve is closed, the curve is smooth, the parallel curve is constructed at a distance r from the original curve, and the radius r is less than the minimal radius of curvature of the original curve.\n\nSolution:\nLet C be the original closed smooth curve parameterized by arc length s, `C(s)`. The unit tangent vector is `t(s) = C'(s)` and the unit normal vector is `n(s)`. The curvature is `κ(s)`. The parallel curve `C_r` at distance `r` is given by `C_r(s) = C(s) + r·n(s)`.\n\nThe derivative of `C_r(s)` with respect to `s` is:\n`C_r'(s) = C'(s) + r·n'(s) = t(s) - rκ(s)t(s) = (1 - rκ(s))t(s)`.\n\nThe magnitude of this vector, which represents the speed along the parallel curve with respect to `s`, is `|C_r'(s)| = |1 - rκ(s)| · |t(s)|`. Since `r` is less than the minimum radius of curvature, `rκ(s) < 1`, so `1 - rκ(s) > 0`. Thus, `|C_r'(s)| = 1 - rκ(s)`. This is the differential of arc length for `C_r`, i.e., `ds_r\/ds = 1 - rκ(s)`.\n\nThe unit tangent vector to the parallel curve, `t_r`, is:\n`t_r = C_r'(s) \/ |C_r'(s)| = ((1 - rκ(s))t(s)) \/ (1 - rκ(s)) = t(s)`.\n\nThe curvature `κ_r` is found from the derivative of `t_r` with respect to the arc length `s_r`. Using the chain rule:\n`κ_r · n_r = dt_r\/ds_r = (dt_r\/ds) · (ds\/ds_r)`.\nSince `t_r = t(s)`, we have `dt_r\/ds = t'(s) = κ(s)n(s)`. The normal vector `n_r` is equal to `n(s)`.\n`κ_r · n(s) = (κ(s)n(s)) · (1 \/ (1 - rκ(s)))`.\n\nTherefore, the curvature of the parallel curve is:\n`κ_r = κ(s) \/ (1 - rκ(s))`.",
