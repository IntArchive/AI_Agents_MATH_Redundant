    "reasoning_create_structured_problem":"Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user wants me to evaluate the Gaussian integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx and show it's equal to √π \/ 2. Hmm, I remember this is a classic integral, but I need to recall the proof. Let me jot down what I know.\n\nFirst, the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-x²} dx. I think the standard approach involves switching to polar coordinates by considering the square of the integral. So maybe if I let I be the integral from 0 to ∞ of e^{-x²} dx, then I² would be the double integral over the first quadrant of e^{-x² - y²} dx dy. Then converting to polar coordinates where x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. But wait, since we're in the first quadrant, the limits for θ would be from 0 to π\/2, and r from 0 to ∞. Then the double integral becomes ∫₀^{π\/2} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ. That seems manageable. The inner integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr can be solved with substitution: let u = r², du = 2r dr, so (1\/2)∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = 1\/2. Then the outer integral ∫₀^{π\/2} 1\/2 dθ = (1\/2)(π\/2) = π\/4. Therefore, I² = π\/4, so I = √π \/ 2. That checks out. But wait, are there any assumptions here? The original integral is from 0 to infinity, so x is a real variable. The function e^{-x²} is continuous and integrable over [0, ∞). The switch to polar coordinates requires that the double integral converges, which it does because the exponential decays rapidly. So the key assumptions would be that we're integrating over the positive real numbers and using Fubini's theorem to justify the double integral. Maybe also that we can switch the order of integration, but since the integrand is positive and the integral converges, that's valid by Tonelli's theorem. I think the main assumption here is the standard one for this integral: integrating a continuous function over an infinite interval, and the justification for using polar coordinates in the double integral. So the problem as stated doesn't have additional constraints beyond the integral limits and the integrand. Therefore, in the formatted problem, the assumption would just be that the integral is over the non-negative real numbers, and the problem is to evaluate it to √π\/2.",

    "final reviewer":"Proof: True\nproof:\n**Problem:**\nProve that I = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2 using polar coordinates, where I² = ∫₀^∞∫₀^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy, and deduce the continuity of e^{-x²} as part of the proof.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Define the Integral and Justify its Existence:**\n    Let I = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx. The function f(x) = e^{-x²} is continuous on the interval [0, ∞) because it is a composition of the exponential function and a polynomial function, both of which are continuous everywhere. This continuity ensures that the improper integral is well-defined.\n\n2.  **Square the Integral:**\n    We consider I²:\n    I² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy)\n    The integrand of the resulting double integral, f(x, y) = e^{-(x²+y²)}, is continuous and non-negative on the domain of integration [0, ∞) × [0, ∞). Therefore, by Fubini's Theorem, we can write I² as a double integral:\n    I² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy\n\n3.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates:**\n    We perform a change of variables to polar coordinates. Let x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ). This implies x² + y² = r². The Jacobian of this transformation gives the differential area element dx dy = r dr dθ. The region of integration, which is the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0), corresponds to a radius r ∈ [0, ∞) and an angle θ ∈ [0, π\/2].\n\n4.  **Evaluate the New Integral:**\n    Substituting the polar expressions into the double integral for I²:\n    I² = ∫₀^(π\/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\n\n5.  **Separate and Solve:**\n    The integral is separable:\n    I² = (∫₀^(π\/2) dθ) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr)\n\n    First, we evaluate the θ integral:\n    ∫₀^(π\/2) dθ = [θ]₀^(π\/2) = π\/2\n\n    Next, we evaluate the r integral using the substitution u = r², which gives du = 2r dr, or r dr = du\/2. The limits of integration for u are from 0 to ∞.\n    ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr = ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} (1\/2)du = 1\/2 [-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = 1\/2 (0 - (-1)) = 1\/2\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    Multiplying the results of the two integrals:\n    I² = (π\/2) * (1\/2) = π\/4\n    Taking the square root, we get I = √(π\/4) = √π\/2. Since the integrand e^{-x²} is strictly positive, the integral I must be positive, so we take the principal root.\n\nThus, it is proven that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2.\nfinal:\n**Problem:**\nProve that ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = √π\/2.\n\n**Proof:**\nLet I = ∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx. The integrand e^{-x²} is a continuous and positive function. We consider I²:\nI² = (∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y²} dy)\nBy Fubini's Theorem, this can be expressed as a double integral over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane:\nI² = ∫₀^∞ ∫₀^∞ e^{-(x²+y²)} dx dy\nWe convert to polar coordinates, setting x = r cos(θ), y = r sin(θ), where x² + y² = r² and the area element dx dy = r dr dθ. The integration limits become r ∈ [0, ∞) and θ ∈ [0, π\/2].\nI² = ∫₀^(π\/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr dθ\nThe integral is separable:\nI² = (∫₀^(π\/2) dθ) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr)\nEvaluating the first integral:\n∫₀^(π\/2) dθ = [θ]₀^(π\/2) = π\/2\nEvaluating the second integral using the substitution u = r² (so du = 2r dr):\n∫₀^∞ e^{-r²} r dr = (1\/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-u} du = (1\/2) [-e^{-u}]₀^∞ = 1\/2\nMultiplying the results:\nI² = (π\/2) * (1\/2) = π\/4\nSince I must be positive, we take the positive square root:\nI = √π\/2",
