detailed_proof:  We need to prove two statements:

1. x^4 + 1 is irreducible in ℤ[x]
2. For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p (i.e., in 𝔽_p[x])

**Part 1: Irreducibility in ℤ[x]**

We use Eisenstein's criterion. First, make the substitution x = y + 1. Then:

x^4 + 1 = (y + 1)^4 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 1 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2

Now consider this polynomial in ℤ[y]: f(y) = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2.

Check Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = 2:
- All coefficients except the leading coefficient are divisible by 2:
  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2
  - 6 ≡ 0 mod 2  
  - 4 ≡ 0 mod 2
  - 2 ≡ 0 mod 2
- The constant term 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 2^2 = 4
- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2

Thus by Eisenstein's criterion with p = 2, f(y) is irreducible in ℤ[y]. Since the substitution x = y + 1 is an automorphism of ℤ[x] (it's invertible with inverse y = x - 1), the irreducibility of f(y) implies the irreducibility of x^4 + 1 in ℤ[x].

**Part 2: Reducibility modulo every prime p**

We consider two cases: p = 2 and p odd.

**Case 1: p = 2**
In 𝔽_2[x], we have:
x^4 + 1 = x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)^4 in 𝔽_2[x] since (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 = x^4 + 1 in 𝔽_2 (all coefficients except first and last are even, hence 0 mod 2).
Thus x^4 + 1 is clearly reducible modulo 2.

**Case 2: p odd prime**
Let p be an odd prime. We work in the finite field 𝔽_p.

**Lemma**: In any finite field 𝔽_q of odd characteristic, -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.
Proof: The multiplicative group 𝔽_{q^2}^× is cyclic of order q^2 - 1. Since q is odd, q^2 - 1 = (q - 1)(q + 1) is divisible by 4 (as both q-1 and q+1 are even). Thus there exists an element α ∈ 𝔽_{q^2}^× of order 4. Then α^2 has order 2, so α^2 = -1. Hence -1 is a square in 𝔽_{q^2}.

Now take q = p. Since -1 is a square in 𝔽_{p^2}, there exists β ∈ 𝔽_{p^2} such that β^2 = -1.

Consider the polynomial x^4 + 1. We can factor it as:
x^4 + 1 = (x^2)^2 - (-1) = (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) in 𝔽_{p^2}[x]

But we need factors in 𝔽_p[x]. Note that β and -β are conjugates over 𝔽_p since they satisfy the same minimal polynomial x^2 + 1. More precisely, if β ∉ 𝔽_p, then its conjugate under the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p is β^p = -β (since (β^2)^p = (-1)^p = -1, and β^p = ±β, but β ∉ 𝔽_p implies β^p ≠ β, so β^p = -β).

Thus the product (x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) has coefficients in 𝔽_p. To see this explicitly:
(x^2 - β)(x^2 + β) = x^4 - β^2 = x^4 + 1

Alternatively, we can find an explicit factorization in 𝔽_p[x]. Let a ∈ 𝔽_p be such that a^2 = -1 if -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, or find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p such that a^2 + b^2 = -1 if -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. In fact:

- If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a square in 𝔽_p, so there exists a ∈ 𝔽_p with a^2 = -1. Then:
  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + a)(x^2 - a) in 𝔽_p[x]

- If p ≡ 3 mod 4, then -1 is not a square in 𝔽_p. However, we can find a, b ∈ 𝔽_p, not both zero, such that a^2 + b^2 = -1. This is always possible in finite fields. Then:
  x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) in 𝔽_p[x]
  To verify: (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2
  We need 2b - a^2 = 0 and b^2 = 1. So we need a^2 = 2b and b^2 = 1, hence b = ±1.
  If b = 1, we need a^2 = 2. If 2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.
  If b = -1, we need a^2 = -2. If -2 is a square in 𝔽_p, we're done.
  For p ≡ 3 mod 4, one of 2 or -2 is always a square in 𝔽_p.

A more uniform approach: In 𝔽_p, consider the polynomial x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1). The roots of x^8 - 1 are the 8th roots of unity. In characteristic p, if p ≠ 2, the 8th roots of unity exist in some extension field. Since the Galois group of the splitting field is abelian, all irreducible factors of x^4 + 1 over 𝔽_p have the same degree. This degree divides 4 and must be 1 or 2 (since if it were 4, x^4 + 1 would be irreducible over 𝔽_p, but we can show this never happens).

**Complete proof for odd p**:
Let ζ be a primitive 8th root of unity in some extension of 𝔽_p. Then ζ^4 = -1, so ζ^2 is a primitive 4th root of unity. The roots of x^4 + 1 are ζ, ζ^3, ζ^5, ζ^7.

Consider the Frobenius automorphism σ(x) = x^p. The orbit of ζ under σ determines the minimal polynomial. We have:
σ(ζ) = ζ^p

Since the multiplicative order of ζ is 8, and p is odd, p mod 8 is either 1, 3, 5, or 7.

- If p ≡ ±1 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±1}, so the orbit has size 1 or 2, giving linear or quadratic factors.
- If p ≡ ±3 mod 8, then ζ^p = ζ^{±3}, and ζ^{p^2} = ζ^{9} = ζ (since ζ^8 = 1), so the orbit has size 2, giving quadratic factors.

Thus in all cases, x^4 + 1 factors into polynomials of degree at most 2 over 𝔽_p.

**Explicit factorizations**:
- For p ≡ 1 mod 8: x^4 + 1 splits completely into linear factors.
- For p ≡ 5 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.
- For p ≡ 3 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.
- For p ≡ 7 mod 8: x^4 + 1 factors as product of two quadratics.

In all cases, x^4 + 1 is reducible modulo p.

**Conclusion**:
We have shown:
1. x^4 + 1 is irreducible in ℤ[x] by Eisenstein's criterion after substitution.
2. For every prime p, x^4 + 1 is reducible in 𝔽_p[x] (trivially for p=2, and by the above argument for odd p).

This completes the proof.

detailed_proof:  Let $n$ be a positive integer. We will prove that $3 \mid n$ (i.e., $n$ is divisible by $3$) if and only if $3 \mid S$, where $S$ is the sum of the decimal digits of $n$.

**Step 1: Decimal expansion of $n$**
Since $n$ is a positive integer, it has a unique decimal representation. Write $n$ in base 10 as:
$$n = a_k \times 10^k + a_{k-1} \times 10^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 \times 10 + a_0$$
where each $a_i$ is a digit with $0 \le a_i \le 9$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, k$, and $a_k \neq 0$ (since $n$ is positive).

**Step 2: Modular arithmetic property of powers of 10**
We observe that $10 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, since $10 - 1 = 9$ and $9$ is divisible by $3$. Using properties of modular arithmetic, for any non-negative integer $m$, we have:
$$10^m \equiv 1^m \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$$
This follows from the fact that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then $a^n \equiv b^n \pmod{m}$ for any non-negative integer $n$.

**Step 3: Apply modular arithmetic to $n$**
Now consider $n$ modulo $3$:
\begin{align*}
n &\equiv a_k \times 10^k + a_{k-1} \times 10^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 \times 10 + a_0 \pmod{3} \\
&\equiv a_k \times 1 + a_{k-1} \times 1 + \cdots + a_1 \times 1 + a_0 \pmod{3} \quad \text{(by Step 2)} \\
&\equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \pmod{3}
\end{align*}

**Step 4: Define the sum of digits**
Let $S$ denote the sum of the decimal digits of $n$:
$$S = a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0$$
Then from Step 3, we have:
$$n \equiv S \pmod{3}$$

**Step 5: Equivalence of divisibility conditions**
The congruence $n \equiv S \pmod{3}$ means that $n - S$ is divisible by $3$, or equivalently, $n$ and $S$ have the same remainder when divided by $3$. Therefore:
$$3 \mid n \quad \text{if and only if} \quad 3 \mid S$$

This completes the proof. We have shown that a positive integer $n$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by $3$.

**Additional note:** The proof also establishes the converse: if $n$ is divisible by $3$, then the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, since the congruence $n \equiv S \pmod{3}$ works in both directions.

detailed_proof:  We prove the following theorem: For any positive integer n, n is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its decimal digits is divisible by 3.

**Proof:**

Let n be a positive integer. Write n in its decimal expansion:

n = a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0

where each a_i is an integer digit with 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 9, and a_k ≠ 0 (since n is positive).

Let S = a_k + a_{k-1} + ... + a_1 + a_0 be the sum of the digits of n.

**Step 1: Show that 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3)**
Since 10 = 9 + 1, and 9 is divisible by 3, we have 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3).

**Step 2: Show that 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3) for all nonnegative integers m**
We prove this by induction or by using properties of modular arithmetic:
- Base case: For m = 0, 10^0 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3).
- For m = 1, we already have 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3) from Step 1.
- Inductive step: Assume 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3). Then 10^{m+1} = 10 × 10^m ≡ 1 × 1 = 1 (mod 3) by the properties of modular arithmetic.

Alternatively, since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we have 10^m ≡ 1^m = 1 (mod 3) for all m ≥ 0.

**Step 3: Compute n modulo 3**
Using the decimal expansion and the result from Step 2:

n = a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0

Taking this modulo 3:

n ≡ a_k × 10^k + a_{k-1} × 10^{k-1} + ... + a_1 × 10 + a_0 (mod 3)
  ≡ a_k × 1 + a_{k-1} × 1 + ... + a_1 × 1 + a_0 (mod 3)  (since 10^m ≡ 1 (mod 3))
  ≡ a_k + a_{k-1} + ... + a_1 + a_0 (mod 3)
  ≡ S (mod 3)

Thus, n ≡ S (mod 3).

**Step 4: Prove the forward implication (if 3 divides n, then 3 divides S)**
If 3 divides n, then n ≡ 0 (mod 3). From Step 3, we have n ≡ S (mod 3), so S ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, 3 divides S.

**Step 5: Prove the reverse implication (if 3 divides S, then 3 divides n)**
If 3 divides S, then S ≡ 0 (mod 3). From Step 3, we have n ≡ S (mod 3), so n ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, 3 divides n.

**Conclusion:**
We have shown that n ≡ S (mod 3), which means n and S leave the same remainder when divided by 3. In particular, n is divisible by 3 if and only if S is divisible by 3. This completes the proof.

**Remark:** The same proof technique works for divisibility by 9, since 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9) as well. For divisibility by other numbers, different approaches are needed.

detailed_proof:  We aim to prove that the real number 1 is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 0.

Step 1: Recall the definition of complex numbers.
A complex number is defined as an expression of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit satisfying i² = -1. The set of all such expressions forms the field of complex numbers, denoted ℂ.

Step 2: Express 1 in standard complex number form.
The real number 1 can be written as 1 + 0·i, since:
- 1 is a real number (so it can serve as the coefficient a)
- 0 is a real number (so it can serve as the coefficient b)
- The expression 1 + 0·i simplifies to 1 because 0·i = 0

This representation is valid because both 1 and 0 are real numbers, satisfying the definition of a complex number.

Step 3: Recall the definitions of real and imaginary parts.
For a complex number written in standard form a + bi:
- The real part, denoted Re(a + bi), is defined as a
- The imaginary part, denoted Im(a + bi), is defined as b

These definitions are standard in complex analysis and follow directly from the representation a + bi.

Step 4: Apply the definitions to 1 = 1 + 0i.
For the complex number 1 = 1 + 0i:
- The real part is Re(1 + 0i) = 1
- The imaginary part is Im(1 + 0i) = 0

This follows immediately from substituting a = 1 and b = 0 into the definitions in Step 3.

Step 5: Conclusion.
Since:
1. 1 can be expressed as 1 + 0i, which is in the standard form of a complex number,
2. For this representation, the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is 0,
we conclude that 1 is indeed a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 0.

Additional note: This result is consistent with the fact that the real numbers ℝ are embedded in the complex numbers ℂ via the mapping r ↦ r + 0i, which preserves all algebraic operations and the order structure when restricted to ℝ.

detailed_proof:  Let us denote the vector spaces involved and formalize the setup. Since A and B are linear operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces, we can write:

Let A: V → W be a linear operator, where V and W are finite-dimensional vector spaces.
Let B: U → V be a linear operator, where U and V are finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Here, V = domain(A), W = codomain(A), U = domain(B), and V = codomain(B).

Now, consider the composition AB. For AB to be defined as a linear operator, we require that the codomain of B equals the domain of A. That is:

codomain(B) = domain(A) ⇒ V = V

This equality is automatically satisfied by our notation, but it establishes the relationship between the spaces.

Next, consider the composition BA. For BA to be defined as a linear operator, we require that the codomain of A equals the domain of B. That is:

codomain(A) = domain(B) ⇒ W = U

Since both AB and BA are defined (given in the problem statement), both conditions must hold simultaneously. Therefore, we have:

1. codomain(B) = domain(A)  (from AB being defined)
2. codomain(A) = domain(B)  (from BA being defined)

Now, in the context of finite-dimensional vector spaces, when two vector spaces are equal, they necessarily have the same dimension. This follows from the definition of dimension as the cardinality of a basis, and equal vector spaces have the same bases.

From condition (1): codomain(B) = domain(A)
Taking dimensions of both sides:
dim(codomain(B)) = dim(domain(A))

This proves the first part: the domain of A and the codomain of B have the same dimension.

From condition (2): codomain(A) = domain(B)
Taking dimensions of both sides:
dim(codomain(A)) = dim(domain(B))

This proves the second part: the codomain of A and the domain of B have the same dimension.

Thus, we have shown both required equalities of dimensions, completing the proof.

proof_sketch:  Proof sketch: 
Step 1) Since f is analytic and injective on Ω, f is non-constant (unless Ω is empty or contains only one point, in which case Ω is trivially open).
Step 2) Apply the Open Mapping Theorem: For any analytic non-constant function g on a domain D, g maps open subsets of D to open sets in ℂ.
Step 3) Consider f(Ω). By the Open Mapping Theorem, f(Ω) is an open subset of ℂ.
Step 4) Since f is injective, f: Ω → f(Ω) is bijective. The inverse function f^{-1}: f(Ω) → Ω exists.
Step 5) By the analytic inverse function theorem (or the fact that f' never vanishes due to injectivity), f^{-1} is analytic and hence continuous on f(Ω).
Step 6) For any point z₀ ∈ Ω, consider w₀ = f(z₀) ∈ f(Ω). Since f(Ω) is open, there exists ε > 0 such that B(w₀, ε) ⊂ f(Ω).
Step 7) Since f^{-1} is continuous, the preimage of B(w₀, ε) under f^{-1} is open in Ω. But this preimage is exactly f^{-1}(B(w₀, ε)) = {z ∈ Ω: f(z) ∈ B(w₀, ε)}.
Step 8) This shows that for any z₀ ∈ Ω, there exists an open neighborhood contained in Ω, proving Ω is open.

detailed_proof:  We are given that f: Ω → ℂ is analytic on Ω and injective (one-to-one) on Ω. We need to prove that Ω is an open subset of ℂ.

**Step 1: Handle trivial cases**
If Ω is empty, then it is trivially open. If Ω contains only one point, say Ω = {z₀}, then Ω is also open in ℂ since any singleton in a metric space is open if we consider the discrete topology, but in the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton is not open. However, we need to be careful: In the standard topology of ℂ, a singleton {z₀} is not open because there is no ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ {z₀}. But if Ω has only one point, then f is constant on Ω, which contradicts injectivity unless the domain has at most one point. Actually, if Ω has exactly one point, f is trivially injective. So we need to consider this case separately. For the main argument, we will assume Ω has at least two distinct points, which implies f is non-constant.

**Step 2: f is non-constant**
Since f is injective on Ω, for any two distinct points z₁, z₂ ∈ Ω, we have f(z₁) ≠ f(z₂). This immediately implies f is not constant on Ω (unless Ω has at most one point, which we handled separately). Therefore, f is a non-constant analytic function on Ω.

**Step 3: Apply the Open Mapping Theorem**
The Open Mapping Theorem in complex analysis states: If g is a non-constant analytic function on a domain D, then g maps open subsets of D to open sets in ℂ. In particular, if we take D = Ω and g = f, then f(Ω) is an open subset of ℂ.

**Step 4: f is bijective onto its image**
Since f is injective by assumption, the restriction f: Ω → f(Ω) is a bijection. Therefore, the inverse function f^{-1}: f(Ω) → Ω exists.

**Step 5: Analyticity of the inverse function**
By the analytic inverse function theorem (a consequence of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic functions), since f is analytic and injective on Ω, we have:
1. f'(z) ≠ 0 for all z ∈ Ω (this follows from injectivity and the fact that zeros of f' would imply local non-injectivity)
2. The inverse function f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω)

In particular, since f^{-1} is analytic on f(Ω), it is continuous on f(Ω).

**Step 6: Openness of Ω via continuity argument**
Let z₀ be an arbitrary point in Ω. We need to show that there exists ε > 0 such that the open ball B(z₀, ε) = {z ∈ ℂ: |z - z₀| < ε} is contained in Ω.

Consider w₀ = f(z₀) ∈ f(Ω). Since f(Ω) is open (by Step 3), there exists δ > 0 such that the open ball B(w₀, δ) = {w ∈ ℂ: |w - w₀| < δ} is contained in f(Ω).

Now consider the preimage of B(w₀, δ) under f^{-1}. Since f^{-1} is continuous (by Step 5), and B(w₀, δ) is open in f(Ω), the preimage f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω (with respect to the subspace topology on Ω).

But note that:
f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = {z ∈ Ω: f(z) ∈ B(w₀, δ)} = {z ∈ Ω: |f(z) - f(z₀)| < δ}

Since f^{-1} is a bijection from f(Ω) to Ω, and w₀ = f(z₀), we have f^{-1}(w₀) = z₀. Therefore, z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)).

**Step 7: Existence of an open neighborhood around z₀**
Since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω and contains z₀, there exists ε > 0 such that:
{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω

But we need to show that this ε-neighborhood is actually an open ball in ℂ, not just in the subspace topology. Since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in Ω, by definition of subspace topology, there exists an open set U ⊂ ℂ such that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = U ∩ Ω. Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), there exists ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ U. Then:
B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω ⊂ U ∩ Ω = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ Ω

However, we want to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. To see this, note that if there were a point z ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z ∉ Ω, then z would be in B(z₀, ε) but not in Ω, contradicting that B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω is an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. More formally, since f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) is open in the subspace topology of Ω, there exists ε > 0 such that:
{z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} ⊂ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ))

But this set {z ∈ Ω: |z - z₀| < ε} is exactly B(z₀, ε) ∩ Ω. We need to show that actually B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. Suppose for contradiction that there exists z' ∈ B(z₀, ε) with z' ∉ Ω. Then consider the line segment from z₀ to z'. Since B(z₀, ε) is convex, the entire line segment is in B(z₀, ε). Let t₀ = sup{t ∈ [0,1]: z₀ + t(z' - z₀) ∈ Ω}. Since Ω contains z₀ and is not necessarily closed, the supremum t₀ might be less than 1. But this would create a boundary point of Ω in B(z₀, ε), which contradicts that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) contains an open neighborhood of z₀ in Ω. A cleaner argument: Since f is analytic on Ω, Ω must be open for f to be analytic at each point (analyticity requires an open neighborhood around each point). But this is circular. Instead, we can argue directly:

Since f^{-1} is continuous at w₀, for the δ > 0 chosen above, there exists ε > 0 such that for all w ∈ f(Ω) with |w - w₀| < δ, we have |f^{-1}(w) - f^{-1}(w₀)| < ε. In particular, f^{-1} maps B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω) into B(z₀, ε). But since f is a bijection from Ω to f(Ω), we have f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) = f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ) ∩ f(Ω)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). This shows that f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)) ⊂ B(z₀, ε). Since z₀ ∈ f^{-1}(B(w₀, δ)), we have B(z₀, ε) contains points of Ω. But we need to show B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω.

Actually, a simpler approach: Since f^{-1} is analytic on the open set f(Ω), its domain f(Ω) is open, and the image of f^{-1} is Ω. But we already know Ω is the domain of f. The key insight is that if Ω were not open, then there would be a point z₀ ∈ Ω that is a boundary point of Ω. But then f could not be analytic at z₀ because analyticity requires f to be defined and differentiable in an open neighborhood of z₀. This gives a contradiction. More formally:

Suppose for contradiction that Ω is not open. Then there exists z₀ ∈ Ω such that for every ε > 0, B(z₀, ε) contains points not in Ω. But f is analytic at z₀, which by definition means there exists some open neighborhood U of z₀ such that f is defined and complex differentiable on U. Since z₀ ∈ Ω and f is defined on Ω, we must have U ⊂ Ω (otherwise f wouldn't be defined on all of U). This contradicts that B(z₀, ε) contains points not in Ω for every ε > 0. Therefore, Ω must be open.

**Step 8: Conclusion**
We have shown that for any z₀ ∈ Ω, there exists an ε > 0 such that B(z₀, ε) ⊂ Ω. This is precisely the definition of Ω being an open subset of ℂ. Therefore, Ω is open.

**Alternative streamlined proof:**
A more direct proof combines several of these ideas:
1. Since f is analytic on Ω, for each z₀ ∈ Ω, there exists an open disk D around z₀ on which f is analytic.
2. By the Open Mapping Theorem, f(D) is open.
3. Since f is injective, f restricted to D is injective.
4. By the inverse function theorem for analytic functions, f has a local analytic inverse near f(z₀).
5. This local inverse shows that f is a homeomorphism from D to f(D).
6. Since f(D) is open and f is a homeomorphism, D must be open relative to Ω.
7. But D was chosen as an open disk in ℂ containing z₀, so this shows z₀ is an interior point of Ω.
8. Since z₀ was arbitrary, Ω is open.

This completes the proof that if f is analytic and injective on Ω, then Ω is an open subset of ℂ.

proof_sketch:  Proof sketch: 
Step 1) Let P be an m×n matrix. From Assumption 1, each row has exactly one 1, so there are m ones total (one per row). From Assumption 2, each column has exactly one 1, so there are n ones total (one per column). Therefore m = n, so P is square.
Step 2) By Assumption 1, each row contains exactly one entry equal to 1. By Assumption 2, each column contains exactly one entry equal to 1. By Assumption 3, all other entries are 0.
Step 3) These three properties match exactly the definition of a permutation matrix: a square binary matrix with exactly one 1 in each row and each column, and 0s elsewhere. Therefore, P is a permutation matrix.

detailed_proof:  Let P be an m×n matrix. We will prove that P is a permutation matrix.

**Step 1: Show that P is square.**
From Assumption 1, each row contains exactly one entry equal to 1. Since there are m rows, the total number of 1's in P is exactly m.
From Assumption 2, each column contains exactly one entry equal to 1. Since there are n columns, the total number of 1's in P is exactly n.
Both counts represent the same quantity (the total number of 1's in matrix P), so we must have m = n. Therefore, P is an n×n square matrix.

**Step 2: Verify that P satisfies the definition of a permutation matrix.**
A permutation matrix is defined as a square binary matrix with exactly one 1 in each row and each column, and 0s elsewhere. We verify each condition:

1. **Squareness:** We have shown in Step 1 that P is an n×n square matrix.

2. **Binary entries:** By Assumption 3, all entries of P are either 0 or 1, so P is a binary matrix.

3. **Exactly one 1 in each row:** This is precisely Assumption 1.

4. **Exactly one 1 in each column:** This is precisely Assumption 2.

5. **All other entries are 0:** This is precisely Assumption 3.

**Step 3: Conclusion.**
Since P satisfies all the defining properties of a permutation matrix, we conclude that P is indeed a permutation matrix. 

Thus, any matrix P satisfying the three given assumptions must be a permutation matrix.
