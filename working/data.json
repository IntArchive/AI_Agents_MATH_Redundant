Since S is non-empty, k ≥ 1.\\n\\nWe can define:\\n- s₁ = min(S) (the smallest element of S)\\n- s₂ = min(S \\\\ {s₁}) (the second smallest element)\\n- s₃ = min(S \\\\ {s₁, s₂}) (the third smallest element)\\n- ...\\n- sₖ = max(S) (the largest element)\\n\\nBy construction, we have s₁ < s₂ < ⋯ < sₖ.\\n\\nTherefore, from Assumptions 1 and 2 alone, we can deduce that the elements of S can be ordered as s₁ < s₂ < ⋯ < sₖ, which is exactly Assumption 3.\\n\\nThis proves that Assumption 3 is redundant and can be derived from Assumptions 1 and 2.\"\n}\n```"
