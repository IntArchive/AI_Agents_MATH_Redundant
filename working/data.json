Without loss of generality, assume s₁ ≤ s₂ ≤ ⋯ ≤ sₙ. Let m be the median of S. Consider f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^n |s_i - x|. For x < s₁: f(x) = (∑s_i) - nx (decreasing). For x > sₙ: f(x) = nx - (∑s_i) (increasing). Therefore, minimum occurs in [s₁, sₙ]. The derivative f'(x) = (# of s_i < x) - (# of s_i > x). The minimum occurs when f'(x) = 0, i.e., (# of s_i < x) = (# of s_i > x), which is exactly the definition of the median. Therefore, f(x) is minimized when x is the median of S.\"\n}\n```"
