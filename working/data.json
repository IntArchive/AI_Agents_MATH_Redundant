We want to show that $f(x) = x^p - x + a$ is irreducible over $F$.\\n\\nStep 1: Show $f(x)$ has no roots in $F$.\\nFor any $b \\\\in F$, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $b^p = b$. Therefore:\\n$f(b) = b^p - b + a = b - b + a = a \\\\neq 0$.\\nSo $f(x)$ has no roots in $F$.\\n\\nStep 2: Suppose $f(x)$ is reducible over $F$. Then it factors as $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ where both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are non-constant polynomials over $F$.\\n\\nStep 3: Let $\\\\alpha$ be a root of $f(x)$ in some extension field $E$ of $F$. Then $\\\\alpha^p - \\\\alpha + a = 0$, so $\\\\alpha^p = \\\\alpha - a$.\\n\\nStep 4: For any $c \\\\in F$, consider $f(\\\\alpha + c)$:\\n$(\\\\alpha + c)^p - (\\\\alpha + c) + a = \\\\alpha^p + c^p - \\\\alpha - c + a = (\\\\alpha - a) + c - \\\\alpha - c + a = 0$.\\nSo $\\\\alpha + c$ is also a root of $f(x)$ for all $c \\\\in F$.\\n\\nStep 5: The roots of $f(x)$ are exactly $\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha+1, \\\\alpha+2, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha+(p-1)$ (all distinct since $p$ is prime).\\n\\nStep 6: Since $f(x)$ is monic of degree $p$, and we have found $p$ distinct roots, $f(x) = \\\\prod_{c \\\\in F} (x - (\\\\alpha + c))$.\\n\\nStep 7: If $f(x)$ were reducible over $F$, then some proper subset of these roots would generate a polynomial with coefficients in $F$. But the minimal polynomial of $\\\\alpha$ over $F$ must have degree dividing $p$, and since $p$ is prime and $\\\\alpha \\\\notin F$, the minimal polynomial must have degree $p$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$.\\n\\nThus, $x^p - x + a$ is irreducible over a field with $p$ elements when $a \\\\neq 0$.\"\n}\n```"
