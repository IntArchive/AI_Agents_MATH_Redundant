Let n = |S| be the number of elements in S.\\n\\nCase 1: n is odd (n = 2m + 1)\\nLet the elements be s₁ ≤ s₂ ≤ ⋯ ≤ s_{2m+1}. The median is s_{m+1}.\\n\\nConsider the function f(x) = ∑_{i=1}^{2m+1} |s_i - x|.\\n\\nFor x < s_{m+1}:\\n- There are m+1 elements greater than x: s_{m+1}, s_{m+2}, ..., s_{2m+1}\\n- There are m elements less than x: s₁, s₂, ..., s_m\\n- The derivative f'(x) = (number of elements > x) - (number of elements < x) = (m+1) - m = 1 > 0\\n- So f is increasing for x < s_{m+1}\\n\\nFor x > s_{m+1}:\\n- There are m elements greater than x: s_{m+2}, ..., s_{2m+1}\\n- There are m+1 elements less than x: s₁, s₂, ..., s_{m+1}\\n- The derivative f'(x) = m - (m+1) = -1 < 0\\n- So f is decreasing for x > s_{m+1}\\n\\nTherefore, f(x) is minimized at x = s_{m+1}, the median.\\n\\nCase 2: n is even (n = 2m)\\nLet the elements be s₁ ≤ s₂ ≤ ⋯ ≤ s_{2m}. The median is any value in [s_m, s_{m+1}].\\n\\nFor x in [s_m, s_{m+1}]:\\n- There are exactly m elements less than or equal to x\\n- There are exactly m elements greater than or equal to x\\n- The derivative f'(x) = 0\\n- So f is constant on [s_m, s_{m+1}]\\n\\nFor x < s_m:\\n- f'(x) > 0 (similar to odd case)\\n- So f is increasing\\n\\nFor x > s_{m+1}:\\n- f'(x) < 0 (similar to odd case)\\n- So f is decreasing\\n\\nTherefore, f(x) is minimized (and constant) for all x in [s_m, s_{m+1}], which includes the median.\\n\\nThus, in both cases, the sum of absolute deviations is minimized when x equals the median.\"\n}\n```"
