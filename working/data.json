Without loss of generality, assume s₁ ≤ s₂ ≤ ⋯ ≤ sₙ. Case 1 (n odd): For n = 2m+1, the median is s_{m+1}. For x < s_{m+1}, the sum increases because we move away from more than half the points. For x > s_{m+1}, the sum increases similarly. Thus minimum occurs at x = s_{m+1}. Case 2 (n even): For n = 2m, the median is any value between s_m and s_{m+1}. For x in [s_m, s_{m+1}], the sum is constant. For x outside this interval, the sum increases. Thus minimum occurs at any median value.\"\n}\n```"
